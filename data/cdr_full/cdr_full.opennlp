Inappropriate use of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> and <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> in typical <START:Disease> absence seizures <END> .
<START:Chemical> Carbamazepine <END> and <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> are contraindicated in typical <START:Disease> absence seizures <END> .
Of 18 consecutive referrals of children with resistant typical absences only , eight were erroneously treated with <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> either as monotherapy or as an add - on .
<START:Chemical> Vigabatrin <END> was also used in the treatment of two children .
Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> and two of these developed <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> , which resolved on withdrawal of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> .
Absences were aggravated in both cases where <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> was added on to concurrent treatment .
Optimal control of the absences was achieved with <START:Chemical> sodium valproate <END> , <START:Chemical> lamotrigine <END> , or <START:Chemical> ethosuximide <END> alone or in combination .
Endocrine screening in 1 , 022 men with <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> : clinical significance and cost - effective strategy .
PURPOSE : We reviewed the results of serum <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and prolactin determination in 1 , 022 patients referred because of <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> and compared the data with history , results of physical examination , other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost - effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : <START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay .
Every patient was screened for <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of <START:Disease> low sexual desire <END> , <START:Disease> gynecomastia <END> or <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> less than 4 ng . / ml .
Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results .
Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1 , 340 patients with <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> and systematic prolactin determination .
Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were <START:Disease> low sexual desire <END> , small testes and <START:Disease> gynecomastia <END> .
Endocrine therapy consisted of <START:Chemical> testosterone heptylate <END> or human chorionic gonadotropin for <START:Disease> hypogonadism <END> and <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> for <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> was less than 3 ng . / ml . in 107 patients but normal in 40 % at repeat determination .
The prevalence of repeatedly low <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> increased with age ( 4 % before age 50 years and 9 % 50 years or older ) .
Two <START:Disease> pituitary tumors <END> were discovered after <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> determination .
Most of the other low <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> levels seemed to result from nonorganic <START:Disease> hypothalamic dysfunction <END> because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36 % ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30 % and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42 % ) .
Determining <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> only in cases of <START:Disease> low sexual desire <END> or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40 % of the cases with low <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> , including 37 % of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy .
Prolactin exceeded 20 ng . / ml . in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination .
Only 1 <START:Disease> prolactinoma <END> was discovered .
These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades ( overall prolactin greater than 20 ng . / ml . in 1 . 86 % of 1 , 821 patients , <START:Disease> prolactinomas <END> in 7 , 0 . 38 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Bromocriptine <END> was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml . ( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng . / ml . ) .
<START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> was low in less than 50 % of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .
CONCLUSIONS : Low prevalences and effects of low <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and high prolactin in <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> cannot justify their routine determination .
However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50 % of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the <START:Disease> pituitary tumors <END> .
We now advocate that before age 50 years <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> be determined only in cases of <START:Disease> low sexual desire <END> and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years .
Prolactin should be determined only in cases of <START:Disease> low sexual desire <END> , <START:Disease> gynecomastia <END> and / or <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> less than 4 ng . / ml .
Upregulation of the expression of <START:Chemical> vasopressin <END> gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes insipidus <END> rat .
The expression of <START:Chemical> arginine vasopressin <END> ( <START:Chemical> AVP <END> ) gene in the paraventricular ( PVN ) and supraoptic nuclei ( SON ) was investigated in rats with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> ( <START:Chemical> Li <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> , using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radioimmunoassay .
The male Wistar rats consuming a diet that contained <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> ( 60 mmol / kg ) for 4 weeks developed marked <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
The <START:Chemical> Li <END> - treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentrations .
Plasma <START:Chemical> sodium <END> concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the <START:Chemical> Li <END> - treated rats compared with those in controls .
Plasma concentration of <START:Chemical> AVP <END> and transcripts of <START:Chemical> AVP <END> gene in the PVN and SON were significantly increased in the <START:Chemical> Li <END> - treated rats compared with controls .
These results suggest that <START:Disease> dehydration <END> and / or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma <START:Chemical> AVP <END> and the upregulation of <START:Chemical> AVP <END> gene expression in the PVN and the SON of the <START:Chemical> Li <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes insipidus <END> rat .
<START:Chemical> Lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac asystole <END> .
Intravenous administration of a single 50 - mg bolus of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> in a 67 - year - old man resulted in profound <START:Disease> depression <END> of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers .
The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of <START:Disease> bradyarrhythmias <END> ; and , thus , this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> .
Sublingual absorption of the <START:Chemical> quaternary ammonium <END> antiarrhythmic agent , <START:Chemical> UM - 272 <END> .
<START:Chemical> UM - 272 <END> ( <START:Chemical> N , N - dimethylpropranolol <END> ) , a quaternary antiarrhythmic agent , was administered sublingually to dogs with <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> - induced <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardias <END> .
Both anti - arrhythmic efficacy and bioavailability were compared to oral drug .
Sublingual <START:Chemical> UM - 272 <END> converted <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> to sinus rhythm in all 5 dogs .
The area under the plasma concentration time curve at 90 min was 4 - 12 times greater than for oral drug , suggesting the existence of an absorption - limiting process in the intestine , and providing an alternate form of administration for quaternary drugs .
Hyperbaric <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> therapy for control of intractable <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
We report a case of intractable <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy for <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> .
Conservative treatment , including bladder irrigation with physiological saline and instillation of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin F 2 alpha <END> , failed to totally control <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
We then used hyperbaric <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> at an absolute pressure of 2 atm , 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks .
The <START:Disease> bleeding <END> ceased completely by the end of treatment and the patient remained free of <START:Disease> hematuria <END> thereafter .
No side effect was noted during the course of therapy .
In future , this form of therapy can offer a safe alternative in the treatment of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Carboplatin <END> toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat .
BACKGROUND : The most striking of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> ' s advantages ( <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> ) over <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( <START:Chemical> CDDP <END> ) is its markedly reduced rate of <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> effects .
However , the use of <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> higher - intensity schedules and the association with other <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to <START:Disease> peripheral nervous system damage <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Two different schedules of <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i . p . twice a week for nine times ) were evaluated in Wistar rats .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxicity <END> was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test ) , neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve ) , morphological , morphometrical and analytical effects .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> administration induced dose - dependent <START:Disease> peripheral neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired , particularly after the high - dose treatment .
The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and , to a lesser extent , satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by <START:Chemical> CDDP <END> , mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons .
Moreover , significant amounts of <START:Chemical> platinum <END> were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> treatment .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> is <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> in our model , and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by <START:Chemical> CDDP <END> that it is probable that <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism .
This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> on the peripheral nervous system .
Protective efficacy of neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> against <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> kindled - <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice .
Neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of <START:Disease> neurological and psychiatric disorders <END> .
They offer protection against <START:Disease> seizures <END> in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of <START:Disease> drug dependence <END> in preclinical assessments .
The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroid <END> that positively modulate the <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A )) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> engendered by repeated <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> administration ( <START:Disease> seizure <END> kindling ) .
<START:Chemical> Allopregnanolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy - 5 alpha - pregnan - 20 - one <END> ) , <START:Chemical> pregnanolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy - 5 beta - pregnan - 20 - one <END> ) and <START:Chemical> ganaxolone <END> ( a synthetic derivative of <START:Chemical> allopregnanolone <END> <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy - 3 beta - methyl - 5 alpha - pregnan - 20 - one <END> ) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression ( anticonvulsant effect ) and development ( antiepileptogenic effect ) of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> in male , Swiss - Webster mice .
Kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> were induced by daily administration of 60 mg / kg <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> for 5 days .
All of these positive <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> , whereas only <START:Chemical> allopregnanolone <END> and <START:Chemical> ganaxolone <END> inhibited the development of kindling .
<START:Chemical> Allopregnanolone <END> and <START:Chemical> pregnanolone <END> , but not <START:Chemical> ganaxolone <END> , also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling .
These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse .
Dose - effect and structure - function relationships in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> CM <END> ) produced by the anticancer drug <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DXR <END> ) ( <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> ) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose - effect and structure - function relationships during development of <START:Disease> myocardial disease <END> .
We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving <START:Chemical> DXR <END> .
Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative <START:Chemical> DXR <END> dose between 100 and 600 mg / m 2 .
Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose , exhibited a curvilinear relationship , and had a " threshold " for expression .
Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage ( r = 0 . 57 to 0 . 78 ) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured , and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear , threshold configuration .
In <START:Chemical> DXR <END> - <START:Disease> CM <END> <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult ( <START:Chemical> DXR <END> dose ) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached , after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly .
<START:Disease> Amnestic syndrome <END> associated with <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> : a case report .
An elderly woman developed an <START:Disease> Alzheimer <END> - like subacute <START:Disease> dementia <END> as a result of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities .
There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug <START:Disease> toxicity <END> can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain .
<START:Chemical> Bradykinin <END> receptors antagonists and <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase inhibitors in <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> and <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> in chemotherapy and <START:Disease> diabetic neuropathy <END> rat model .
PURPOSE : The influence of an irreversible inhibitor of constitutive <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase ( L - NOArg ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) , a relatively selective inhibitor of inducible <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase ( L - NIL ; 1 . 0 mg / kg ip ) and a relatively specific inhibitor of neuronal <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase ( 7 - NI ; 0 . 1 mg / kg ip ) , on antihyperalgesic action of selective antagonists of B 2 and B 1 receptors : D - Arg - [ Hyp 3 , Thi 5 , D - Tic 7 , Oic 8 ] <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> ( <START:Chemical> HOE 140 <END> ; 70 nmol / kg ip ) or <START:Chemical> des Arg 10 HOE 140 <END> ( 70 nmol / kg ip ) respectively , in model of <START:Disease> diabetic ( streptozotocin - induced ) and toxic ( vincristine - induced ) neuropathy <END> was investigated .
METHODS : The changes in <START:Disease> pain <END> thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli -- the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto .
RESULTS : The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> receptors and inducible <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase but not neuronal <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase activity reduces <START:Disease> diabetic hyperalgesia <END> .
Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI , significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both <START:Chemical> HOE 140 <END> and <START:Chemical> des Arg 10 HOE 140 <END> .
It was also shown that both products of inducible <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase and neuronal <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase activation as well as <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> are involved in <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> produced by <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> .
Moreover , L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of <START:Chemical> HOE 140 <END> or <START:Chemical> des - Arg 10 HOE 140 <END> in <START:Disease> toxic neuropathy <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Results of these studies suggest that B 1 and B 2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both <START:Disease> diabetic and toxic neuropathy <END> .
In <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> , inducible <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> , whereas in <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> seemed to activate neuronal <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase pathway .
Therefore , concomitant administration of small doses of <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> receptor antagonists and <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase inhibitors can be effective in alleviation of <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> , even in hospital care .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced brainstem <START:Disease> seizures <END> and behavior .
A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects .
The abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> , <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> , " beating drum " behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing , and facial twitching .
Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation .
These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates .
Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .
<START:Chemical> Antidepressant <END> - induced <START:Disease> mania <END> in <START:Disease> bipolar <END> patients : identification of risk factors .
BACKGROUND : Concerns about possible risks of switching to <START:Disease> mania <END> associated with <START:Chemical> antidepressants <END> continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for <START:Disease> bipolar depression <END> .
METHOD : The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for <START:Disease> bipolar disorder <END> to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale .
Patients who experienced a <START:Disease> manic <END> or <START:Disease> hypomanic <END> switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( <START:Disease> DSM - IV bipolar I <END> vs . <START:Disease> bipolar II <END> ) , number of previous <START:Disease> manic <END> episodes , type of <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs . <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> drugs and , more particularly , selective <START:Chemical> serotonin reuptake inhibitors <END> [ <START:Chemical> SSRIs <END> ] ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( <START:Chemical> lithium <END> vs . anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview .
RESULTS : Switches to <START:Disease> hypomania <END> or <START:Disease> mania <END> occurred in 27 % of all patients ( N = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with <START:Chemical> SSRIs <END> [ 8 / 33 ] ) ; 16 % ( N = 7 ) experienced <START:Disease> manic <END> episodes , and 11 % ( N = 5 ) experienced <START:Disease> hypomanic <END> episodes .
Sex , age , diagnosis ( <START:Disease> bipolar I <END> vs . <START:Disease> bipolar II <END> ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching .
The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer .
In contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> ( 44 % , 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) .
The number of previous <START:Disease> manic <END> episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p = . 008 ) .
CONCLUSION : The frequency of mood switching associated with acute <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> therapy may be reduced by <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
Particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyperthymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches .
Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt - sensitivity in lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - treated spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
OBJECTIVE : To test the hypothesis that , in lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - treated spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats ( SHR ) , the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> dietary sodium chloride <END> supplementation .
METHODS : Male SHR ( aged 6 weeks ) that had been treated from conception onward with either <START:Chemical> captopril <END> or vehicle remained on a basal <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet or were fed a high <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet .
After 2 weeks , the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later , an infusion of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
RESULTS : Lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups .
Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the <START:Chemical> dietary sodium chloride <END> - induced <START:Disease> increase in MAP <END> in both groups .
Infusion of the central nervous system <START:Chemical> alpha 2 - adrenergic receptor agonist <END> <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high ( compared with the basal ) <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet .
CONCLUSIONS : In both lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - treated and control SHR , the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet .
<START:Chemical> Pethidine <END> - associated <START:Disease> seizure <END> in a healthy adolescent receiving <START:Chemical> pethidine <END> for <START:Disease> postoperative pain <END> control .
A healthy 17 - year - old male received standard intermittent doses of <START:Chemical> pethidine <END> via a patient - controlled analgesia ( PCA ) pump for management of <START:Disease> postoperative pain <END> control .
Twenty - three h postoperatively he developed a brief self - limited <START:Disease> seizure <END> .
Both plasma <START:Chemical> pethidine <END> and <START:Chemical> norpethidine <END> were elevated in the range associated with clinical manifestations of central nervous system excitation .
No other risk factors for CNS <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were identified .
This method allowed frequent self - dosing of <START:Chemical> pethidine <END> at short time intervals and rapid accumulation of <START:Chemical> pethidine <END> and <START:Chemical> norpethidine <END> .
The routine use of <START:Chemical> pethidine <END> via PCA even for a brief postoperative analgesia should be reconsidered .
Absolute and attributable risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> in women on combined <START:Chemical> cyproterone acetate <END> and <START:Chemical> ethinylestradiol <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To achieve absolute risk estimates of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> ( <START:Disease> VTE <END> ) among women on <START:Chemical> cyproterone acetate <END> plus <START:Chemical> ethinylestradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> ) , and among women on <START:Chemical> combined oral contraceptives <END> ( <START:Chemical> COCs <END> ) .
METHODS : From the Danish National Register of Patients ( NRP ) , 1996 to 1998 , the records of 1 . 1 million Danish women , ages 15 to 44 years , were searched for evidence of <START:Disease> VTE <END> .
<START:Chemical> COC <END> use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires .
Sales statistics of <START:Chemical> COCs <END> and <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> were provided through Danish Drug Statistics .
RESULTS : During the time frame of the study , 330 women were found to have had <START:Disease> VTE <END> while on <START:Chemical> COCs <END> .
Of these women , 67 were on <START:Chemical> levonorgestrel <END> - containing <START:Chemical> COCs <END> .
Eleven were on <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
The corresponding absolute risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> was 3 . 4 ( range , 3 . 1 - 3 . 8 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on <START:Chemical> COCs <END> , 4 . 2 ( range , 3 . 2 - 5 . 2 ) per 10 000 women years among women on <START:Chemical> levonorgestrel <END> - containing <START:Chemical> COCs <END> , and 3 . 1 ( range , 1 . 3 - 4 . 9 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
CONCLUSION : Our results suggest the absolute risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> among Danish women on <START:Chemical> COCs <END> is similar to that among women taking <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
Associations between use of <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> or related drugs and health , physical abilities and cognitive function : a non - randomised clinical study in the elderly .
OBJECTIVE : To describe associations between the use of <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> or related drugs ( <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs ) and health , functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly .
METHODS : A non - randomised clinical study of patients aged > or = 65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month . 164 patients ( mean age + / - standard deviation [ SD ] 81 . 6 + / - 6 . 8 years ) were admitted .
Of these , nearly half ( n = 78 ) had used <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs before admission , and the remainder ( n = 86 ) were non - users .
Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .
Patients scoring > or = 20 MMSE sum points were interviewed ( n = 79 ) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission .
Data on use of <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs before admission , current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records .
Health , physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD / RD users and non - users , and adjustments were made for confounding variables .
The residual serum concentrations of <START:Chemical> oxazepam <END> , <START:Chemical> temazepam <END> and <START:Chemical> zopiclone <END> were analysed .
RESULTS : The mean + / - SD duration of BZD / RD use was 7 + / - 7 years ( range 1 - 31 ) .
Two or three <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs were concomitantly taken by 26 % of users ( n = 20 ) .
Long - term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS , which tended to be related to diagnosed <START:Disease> dementia <END> .
After adjustment for these variables as confounders , use of <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE .
However , use of <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs was associated with <START:Disease> dizziness <END> , <START:Disease> inability to sleep <END> after awaking at night and <START:Disease> tiredness <END> in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger <START:Disease> depressive symptoms <END> measured at the beginning of the hospital stay .
Use of <START:Chemical> BZDs <END> / RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night - time sleep during the week prior to admission .
A higher residual serum concentration of <START:Chemical> temazepam <END> correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables .
CONCLUSIONS : Long - term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD / RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses .
Long - term use was associated with daytime and night - time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs .
Urine N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase -- a marker of tubular damage ?
BACKGROUND : Although an indicator of <START:Disease> renal tubular dysfunction <END> , an increased urinary N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> Puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days .
The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty three .
RESULTS : Following intravenous <START:Chemical> PAN <END> urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four .
After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity .
Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards .
Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four .
Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards ) .
CONCLUSIONS : This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells .
Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .
Safety of <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> : a review .
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD : <START:Chemical> Fluoropyrimidines <END> , in particular <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) , have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid <START:Disease> tumors <END> , including <START:Disease> colorectal , breast and head and neck cancers <END> , for > 40 years .
AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW : This article reviews the pharmacology and efficacy of <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> with a special emphasis on its safety .
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN : The reader will gain better insight into the safety of <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> in special populations such as patients with advanced age , <START:Disease> renal and kidney disease <END> .
We also explore different dosing and schedules of <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> administration .
TAKE HOME MESSAGE : <START:Chemical> Capecitabine <END> is an oral prodrug of <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> and was developed to fulfill the need for a more convenient therapy and provide an improved safety / efficacy profile .
It has shown promising results alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in <START:Disease> colorectal , breast , pancreaticobiliary , gastric , renal cell and head and neck cancers <END> .
The most commonly reported toxic effects of <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> are <START:Disease> diarrhea <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , <START:Disease> stomatitis <END> and <START:Disease> hand - foot syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Capecitabine <END> has a well - established safety profile and can be given safely to patients with advanced age , <START:Disease> hepatic and renal dysfunctions <END> .
The striatum as a target for anti - rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR 1 , but not an agonist of group II metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptors .
The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 ( mGluR 1 ) and group II mGluRs , localized in the striatum , are involved in antiparkinsonian - like effects in rats .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> ( 1 mg / kg ip ) induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> - like <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> , measured as an increased resistance of a rat ' s hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint .
<START:Chemical> ( RS ) - 1 - aminoindan - 1 , 5 - dicarboxylic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> AIDA <END> ; 0 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a potent and selective mGluR 1 antagonist , or <START:Chemical> ( 2 R , 4 R ) - 4 - aminopyrrolidine - 2 , 4 - dicarboxylate <END> ( <START:Chemical> 2 R , 4 R - APDC <END> ; 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a selective group II agonist , was injected bilaterally into the striatum of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - treated animals .
<START:Chemical> AIDA <END> in doses of 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl diminished the <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> 2 R , 4 R - APDC <END> injections were ineffective .
The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR 1 , but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs , may ameliorate <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
Intracranial pressure increases during <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> .
Intracranial pressure ( ICP ) was measured during <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> in rats .
Ten rats had arterial , central venous ( CVP ) , and subdural cannulae inserted under <START:Chemical> halothane <END> anesthesia .
The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia ( PCO 2 = 42 + / - 1 mmHg , mean + / - SE ) .
Following instrumentation , <START:Chemical> halothane <END> was discontinued and <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> ( 125 mu / kg ) administered iv during emergence from <START:Chemical> halothane <END> anesthesia .
In the five rats that developed <START:Disease> somatic rigidity <END> , ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline ( delta ICP 7 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 mmHg , delta CVP 5 . 9 + / - 1 . 3 mmHg ) .
These variables returned to baseline when <START:Disease> rigidity <END> was abolished with <START:Chemical> metocurine <END> .
In five rats that did not become rigid , ICP and CVP did not change following <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> .
These observations suggest that <START:Disease> rigidity <END> should be prevented when <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> , and , presumably , other opiates , are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems .
Lifetime treatment of mice with <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) produces <START:Disease> myelodysplasia <END> .
<START:Chemical> AZT <END> has induced a <START:Disease> macrocytic anemia <END> in <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patients on long term <START:Chemical> AZT <END> therapy .
It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> into the chain in place of <START:Chemical> thymidine <END> thus preventing the <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation .
CBA / Ca male mice started on <START:Chemical> AZT <END> 0 . 75 mg / ml H 2 O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0 . 5 mg / ml H 2 O for a group , another group removed from <START:Chemical> AZT <END> to see recovery , and third group remained on 0 . 75 mg . At 687 days mice that had been on 0 . 75 mg had average platelet counts of 2 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) .
Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> showed changes compatible with <START:Disease> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> MDS <END> ) .
A variety of histological patterns was observed .
There were two cases of hypocellular <START:Disease> myelodysplasia <END> , two cases of hypersegmented <START:Disease> myelodysplastic <END> granulocytosis , two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei , one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a <START:Disease> hyperplastic marrow <END> , <START:Disease> dysmyelopoiesis <END> and a <START:Disease> hypocellular marrow <END> and two cases of <START:Disease> myelodysplasia <END> with <START:Disease> dyserythropoiesis <END> , <START:Disease> hemosiderosis <END> and a <START:Disease> hypocellular marrow <END> .
Above mentioned <START:Chemical> AZT <END> incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells , which is known to be seen commonly in the <START:Disease> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> .
Increase of <START:Disease> Parkinson disability <END> after <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> medication .
<START:Disease> Depression <END> is a major clinical feature of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
We report the increased amount of <START:Disease> motor disability <END> in four patients with <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> after exposure to the <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> .
The possibility of a clinically relevant <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - antagonistic capacity of <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> patients must be considered .
Adequate timing of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> reduction in patients with <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> during combination therapy of <START:Chemical> interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> for <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hemolytic anemia <END> is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of <START:Chemical> interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
Because of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - related <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , dose reduction is a common event in this therapy .
In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> reduction in patients with <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> during combination therapy .
METHODS : Thirty - seven of 160 patients who had HCV - genotype 1 b , had high virus load , and received 24 - week combination therapy developed <START:Disease> anemia <END> with hemoglobin level < 10 g / dl or <START:Disease> anemia <END> - related signs during therapy .
After that , these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> ( 200 mg ) per day .
After reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group A ) .
However , 10 of 37 patients with reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> could not continue combination therapy because their < 8 . 5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or <START:Disease> anemia <END> - related severe side effects occurred ( group B ) .
We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> in groups A and B .
RESULTS : A sustained virological response ( SVR ) was 29 . 6 % ( 8 / 27 ) in group A and 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B , respectively .
A 34 . 4 % ( 12 / 27 ) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B ( P = 0 . 051 ) , with slight significance .
With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> reduction , a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or = 10 g / dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with < 10 g / dl ( P = 0 . 036 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> at hemoglobin level > or = 10 g / dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> subsequent to the administration of <START:Chemical> rifampicin <END> .
A follow - up study of cases reported earlier .
A clinical presentation is made of a 2 - 3 year follow - up of six cases of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> that have been reported earlier .
The patients had developed transient <START:Disease> renal failure <END> after the intermittent administration of <START:Chemical> rifampicin <END> .
The stage of olig - <START:Disease> anuria <END> lasted for 1 - 3 weeks , and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis .
Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow - up period .
The four patients re - examined were clinically cured .
Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce .
Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied .
Renal function was normal .
In three cases the excretion at 131 I - hippuran renography was slightly slowed .
Although in the acute stage the <START:Disease> renal lesions <END> histologically appeared toxic , evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> immune reaction as a mechanism for <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - associated <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To assess lymphocyte reactivity to <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> and to serum containing putative ex vivo <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> antigens or metabolites in a case of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> .
PATIENT : A 58 - year - old woman with a clinical diagnosis of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> .
METHODS : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> intake .
A similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subject .
RESULTS : No lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> solutions .
A significant proliferative response to serum collected after <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug intake .
No reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar conditions .
CONCLUSIONS : The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo - prepared <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> antigens , suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> .
Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - associated <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> .
INTRODUCTION : <START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> use has been associated with <START:Disease> neurovascular complications <END> , including arterial vasoconstriction and <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> .
However , there are few studies of angiographic effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> on human cerebral arteries .
Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - associated <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> SAH <END> ) who underwent angiography shortly after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
METHODS : We screened patients with <START:Disease> SAH <END> retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or its metabolites .
Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with <START:Disease> SAH <END> who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter .
Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made .
RESULTS : Thirteen patients with positive <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> toxicology were compared to 26 controls .
There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid , sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral , precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral , or basilar arteries ( p greater than 0 . 05 for all comparisons , unpaired t - tests ) .
There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery ( p greater than 0 . 05 , unpaired t - tests ) .
Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group .
CONCLUSION : No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> could be found in patients who underwent angiography after <START:Disease> aneurysmal <END> <START:Disease> SAH <END> associated with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
The role of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> in smoking - related <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> .
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> could play a role in accelerating <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect .
Almost certainly , <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of <START:Chemical> carbon monoxide <END> .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> does not appear to enhance <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> among humans .
Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> support the idea that toxins other than <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events .
Finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> appears to be flat , suggesting that if <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low - level cigarette exposures .
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during <START:Chemical> fluorouracil <END> therapy : a prospective study .
Although there have been anecdotal reports of <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) therapy , this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion .
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion for treatment of solid <START:Disease> tumors <END> in order to assess the incidence of <START:Disease> ischemic <END> ST changes .
Patients were monitored for 23 + / - 4 hours before <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion , and 98 + / - 9 hours during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion .
<START:Disease> Anginal <END> episodes were rare : only one patient had <START:Disease> angina <END> ( during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion ) .
However , asymptomatic ST changes ( greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation ) were common : six of 25 patients ( 24 % ) had ST changes before <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion v 17 ( 68 % ) during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion ( P less than . 002 ) .
The incidence of <START:Disease> ischemic <END> episodes per patient per hour was 0 . 05 + / - 0 . 02 prior to <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion v 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 03 during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion ( P less than . 001 ) ; the duration of ECG changes was 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 3 minutes per patient per hour before <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> v 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 5 minutes per patient per hour during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ( P less than . 01 ) .
ECG changes were more common among patients with known <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
There were two cases of <START:Disease> sudden death <END> , both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , particularly among patients with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined .
Adverse effects of topical <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> on auditory nerve function .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Papaverine hydrochloride <END> is a direct - acting vasodilator used to manage <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> during various neurosurgical operations .
Transient <START:Disease> cranial nerve dysfunction <END> has been described in a few cases with topical <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> .
This study supports previous reports and provides neurophysiological evidence of an adverse effect on the auditory nerve .
METHODS : We conducted a retrospective review of 70 consecutive microvascular decompression operations and studied those patients who received topical <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> for <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> .
Topical <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> was used as a direct therapeutic action to manage <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> in a total of 11 patients .
The timing of <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> application and ongoing operative events was reviewed relative to changes in neurophysiological recordings .
Brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( BAEPs ) were routinely used to monitor cochlear nerve function during these operations .
FINDINGS : A temporal relationship was found between topical <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> and BAEP changes leading to complete waveform loss .
The average temporal delay between <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> and the onset of an adverse BAEP change was 5 min .
In 10 of 11 patients , BAEP waves II / III - V completely disappeared within 2 to 25 min after <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> .
Eight of these 10 patients had complete loss of BAEP waveforms within 10 min .
One patient showed no recovery of later waves and a delayed profound <START:Disease> sensorineural hearing loss <END> .
The average recovery time of BAEP waveforms to pre - <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> baseline values was 39 min .
CONCLUSIONS : Topical <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> for the treatment of <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> was associated with the onset of a transient disturbance in neurophysiological function of the ascending auditory brainstem pathway .
The complete disappearance of BAEP waveforms with a consistent temporal delay suggests a possible <START:Disease> adverse effect on the proximal eighth nerve <END> .
Recommendations to avoid potential <START:Disease> cranial nerve deficits <END> from <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> are provided .
Drug - associated acute - onset <START:Disease> vanishing bile duct <END> and <START:Disease> Stevens - Johnson syndromes <END> in a child .
Acute <START:Disease> vanishing bile duct <END> syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> in adults , is most often drug or toxin related , and is of unknown pathogenesis .
It has not been reported previously in children .
<START:Disease> Stevens - Johnson syndrome <END> is a well - recognized immune complex - mediated <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> reaction that affects all age groups , is drug or <START:Disease> infection <END> induced , and has classic systemic , mucosal , and dermatologic manifestations .
A previously healthy child who developed acute , severe , rapidly progressive <START:Disease> vanishing bile duct syndrome <END> shortly after <START:Disease> Stevens - Johnson syndrome <END> is described ; this was temporally associated with <START:Chemical> ibuprofen <END> use .
Despite therapy with <START:Chemical> ursodeoxycholic acid <END> , <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> , and then <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> , her <START:Disease> cholestatic disease <END> was unrelenting , with <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation .
This case documents acute drug - related <START:Disease> vanishing bile duct syndrome <END> in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both <START:Disease> Stevens - Johnson syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> vanishing bile duct syndrome <END> .
Anti - oxidant effects of <START:Chemical> atorvastatin <END> in <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in the rat .
1 . <START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> ( <START:Chemical> Dex <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) deficiency and increased <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> O 2 - <END> ) production .
<START:Chemical> Atorvastatin <END> ( <START:Chemical> Ato <END> ) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of <START:Chemical> NO <END> and reduced <START:Chemical> O 2 - <END> production in various forms of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
In the present study , we investigated whether 50 mg / kg per day , p . o . , <START:Chemical> Ato <END> could prevent endothelial <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase ( eNOS ) downregulation and the increase in <START:Chemical> O 2 - <END> in Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats , thereby reducing blood pressure .
2 . Male SD rats ( n = 30 ) were treated with <START:Chemical> Ato <END> ( 50 mg / kg per day in drinking water ) or tap water for 15 days .
<START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> ( 10 microg / kg per day , s . c . ) or saline was started after 4 days in <START:Chemical> Ato <END> - treated and non - treated rats and continued for 11 - 13 days .
Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) was measured on alternate days using the tail - cuff method .
Endothelial function was assessed by <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> - induced vasorelaxation and <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> - induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments .
Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi - quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction .
3 .
In rats treated with <START:Chemical> Dex <END> alone , SBP was increased from 109 + / - 2 to 133 + / - 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14 , respectively ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
In the <START:Chemical> Ato <END> + <START:Chemical> Dex <END> group , SBP was increased from 113 + / - 2 to 119 + / - 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14 , respectively ( P < 0 . 001 ) , but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with <START:Chemical> Dex <END> alone ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Endothelial - dependent relaxation and eNOS mRNA expression were greater in the <START:Chemical> Dex <END> + <START:Chemical> Ato <END> group than in the <START:Chemical> Dex <END> only group ( P < 0 . 05 and P < 0 . 0001 , respectively ) .
Aortic <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> production was lower in the <START:Chemical> Dex <END> + <START:Chemical> Ato <END> group compared with the group treated with <START:Chemical> Dex <END> alone ( P < 0 . 0001 ) .
4 .
Treatment with <START:Chemical> Ato <END> improved endothelial function , reduced <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> production and reduced SBP in <START:Chemical> Dex <END> - treated SD rats .
Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> virus - related <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> monotherapy .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection <END> , which causes <START:Disease> liver cirrhosis <END> and <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> , remains a major health problem in Asian countries .
Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers , although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now .
In this report , we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV - related <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy .
The patient was a 50 - year - old woman .
Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient , thus this patient had been referred to our hospital .
However , the administration of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> , a reverse transcriptase inhibitor , for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity .
During this period , no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged , and the serum HBV - DNA level was continuously suppressed .
These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued .
Moreover , both <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen <END> were observed to have disappeared in this patient .
The administration of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> to patients with HBV - related <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> , like our present case , should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option , especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available .
Acute <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> associated with <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
OBJECTIVE : A case of acute <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> associated with the commencement of <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> is described , highlighting the onset , course and possible contributing factors .
There is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> use .
RESULTS : A 20 - year - old male with <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> developed a sudden onset of <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> after commencement of <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
The patient recovered with intensive medical support .
The symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> in an inpatient setting .
Possible contributing factors may have been concomitant <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> use and unaccustomed physical activity .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Myocarditis <END> is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
It can be fatal if not recognized and treated early .
Considering that <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant <START:Disease> psychosis <END> , there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and paramedical staff involved in the care of these patients .
There are also implications for recommendations and regulations regarding the use of <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute liver failure <END> in two patients with regular <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption ingesting <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> at therapeutic dosage .
BACKGROUND : The possible role of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> in the development of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> associated with therapeutic doses of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ) is currently debated .
CASE REPORT : We describe 2 patients who were regular consumers of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> and who developed <START:Disease> liver failure <END> within 3 - 5 days after hospitalization and stopping <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption while being treated with 4 g <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> / day .
A <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> serum level obtained in one of these patients was not in the toxic range .
Possible risk factors for the development of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in patients treated with therapeutic doses of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> are discussed .
CONCLUSION : In patients with risk factors , e . g . regular consumption of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> , <START:Disease> liver failure <END> is possible when therapeutic doses are ingested .
We propose that the <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> dose should not exceed 2 g / day in such patients and that their liver function should be monitored closely while being treated with <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation .
To quantify the effects of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> , <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation , these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally ( 30 mg / kg / day ) for 7 , 14 or 21 days .
Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia , urinary measurements of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> , <START:Chemical> potassium <END> , endogenous lysozyme , N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i . v . administration of egg - white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance ( GFR ) were done in each treatment group .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin <END> administration decreased diameter , density and shape of endothelial fenestrae .
<START:Chemical> Kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> appeared to have no effect at the dose used .
All three <START:Chemical> aminoglycosides <END> decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> .
While <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> and <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i . v . administration of egg - white lysozyme <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> had no effect .
Daily excretion of total protein , endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> .
Thus , <START:Chemical> aminoglycosides <END> may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and / or tubular level inducing <START:Disease> impairment of renal reabsorption <END> and accumulation of proteins .
Immunopathology of <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> glomerular disease <END> .
Four patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> developed heavy <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> after five to 12 months of treatment with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> .
Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase , or no departure from normal .
Electron microscopy , however , revealed subepithelial electron - dense deposits , fusion of epithelial cell foot processes , and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity .
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C 3 .
The findings were similar to those in early <START:Disease> membranous glomerulonephritis <END> , differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early - acting complement components C 1 q and C 4 .
It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway .
Effect of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> on the <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> evoked by <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration .
OBJECTIVE : In this study the effect of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> on the <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> was evaluated in nine female patients with <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia <END> .
METHOD : <START:Disease> Sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> was induced by <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration ( 0 . 5 mg <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> intramuscularly and 10 mg <START:Chemical> morphine <END> subcutaneously ) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy .
The entire procedure was repeated during <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> infusion ( <START:Chemical> Nitrolingual <END> 1 microg / kg / min for 120 min ) .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity ( Tmax ) over the hepatic hilum ( HH : 34 . 33 + / - 5 . 05 vs . 22 . 77 + / - 3 . 26 ) and the common bile duct ( CBD : 60 . 44 + / - 5 . 99 vs . 40 . 0 + / - 2 . 88 ) and in the half - time of excretion ( T 1 / 2 ) over the liver parenchyma ( LP : 120 . 04 + / - 16 . 01 vs . 27 . 37 + / - 2 . 19 ) , HH ( 117 . 61 + / - 14 . 71 vs . 31 . 85 + / - 3 . 99 ) and CBD ( 158 . 11 + / - 9 . 18 vs . 40 . 1 + / - 6 . 24 ) , indicating a complete <START:Disease> spasm <END> at the level of the sphincter of Oddi .
<START:Chemical> Glyceryl trinitrate <END> infusion completely normalized the <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced alterations in these quantitative parameters ( TmaX over the LP : 11 . 33 + / - 1 . 13 ; over the HH : 18 . 88 + / - 1 . 48 ; and over the CBD : 36 . 22 + / - 1 . 92 ; and T 1 / 2 over the LP : 28 . 21 + / - 1 . 83 ; over the HH : 33 . 42 + / - 3 . 10 ; and over the CBD : 41 . 66 + / - 6 . 33 ) , suggesting an effective sphincter - relaxing effect of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> .
CONCLUSION : These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> on the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> in humans .
Since <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> is able to overcome even the drastic effect of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , it might be of relevance in the treatment of <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Disease> Myocardial ischemia <END> due to <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> during <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress echocardiography .
<START:Chemical> Dobutamine <END> stress echocardiography ( DSE ) is a useful and safe provocation test for <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
Until now , the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery , and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed <START:Disease> coronary artery stenosis <END> .
The aim of the present study is to examine whether <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> due to <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> is induced by <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> .
We performed DSE on 51 patients with <START:Disease> coronary spastic angina <END> but without significant fixed <START:Disease> coronary artery stenosis <END> .
All patients had <START:Disease> anginal <END> attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ( <START:Disease> variant angina <END> ) .
Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> , and no fixed <START:Disease> coronary artery stenosis <END> was documented on angiograms in all patients .
DSE was performed with intravenous <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion with an incremental doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 minutes .
Of the 51 patients , 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation .
All 7 patients ( 13 . 7 % ) had <START:Disease> chest pain <END> during asynergy , and both <START:Disease> chest pain <END> and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy .
These findings indicate that <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> can provoke <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> in some patients with <START:Disease> coronary spastic angina <END> .
When DSE is performed to evaluate <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , not only fixed <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> , but also <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> should be considered as a genesis of asynergy .
<START:Chemical> Vasopressin <END> in the treatment of <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in severe <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> in the treatment of severe <START:Disease> heart failure <END> is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
In patients with decompensated <START:Disease> heart failure <END> with <START:Disease> hypotension <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> , low doses of <START:Chemical> vasopressin <END> restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> .
Reversible <START:Disease> inferior colliculus lesion <END> in <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> : magnetic resonance findings on diffusion - weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging .
OBJECTIVE : This is to present reversible <START:Disease> inferior colliculus lesions <END> in <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> , to focus on the diffusion - weighted imaging ( DWI ) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) imaging .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : From November 2005 to September 2007 , 8 patients ( 5 men and 3 women ) were diagnosed as having <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> ( age range ; 43 - 78 years ) .
They had been taking <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> ( total dosage , 45 - 120 g ; duration , 30 days to 2 months ) to treat the <START:Disease> infection <END> in various organs .
Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were obtained after the hospitalization , including DWI ( 8 / 8 ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map ( 4 / 8 ) , FLAIR ( 7 / 8 ) , and T 2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8 ) .
Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14 th days after discontinuation of <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> administration .
Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus , to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities , their locations , and signal changes on follow - up images .
RESULTS : Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T 2 - weighted image ) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8 ) , inferior colliculus ( 6 / 8 ) , corpus callosum ( 2 / 8 ) , pons ( 2 / 8 ) , medulla ( 1 / 8 ) , and bilateral cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8 ) .
High - signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map ( 3 / 4 ) , but in one patient , high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map .
All the lesions in dentate , inferior colliculus , pons , and medullas had been resolved completely on follow - up MRIs in 5 patients , but in 1 patient of them , corpus <START:Disease> callosal lesion <END> persisted .
CONCLUSIONS : Reversible <START:Disease> inferior colliculus lesions <END> could be considered as the characteristic for <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> , next to the dentate nucleus involvement .
Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block .
We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block ( IBPB ) .
<START:Chemical> Bupivacaine <END> 0 . 75 % with <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> was given followed by a 24 - hr continuous infusion of 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
Three audiometric threshold measurements ( 0 . 25 - 18 kHz ) were made : the first before IBPB , the second 2 - 6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation .
In four patients <START:Disease> hearing impairment <END> on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation , in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day .
The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients ; in one only low frequencies ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 kHz ) were involved .
The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
This patient had hearing threshold changes ( 15 - 20 dB ) at 6 - 10 kHz on the opposite side also .
IBPB may cause transient <START:Disease> auditory dysfunction <END> in the ipsilateral ear , possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation .
GLEPP 1 receptor <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> phosphatase ( Ptpro ) in rat <START:Chemical> PAN <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
A marker of acute podocyte injury .
Glomerular epithelial protein 1 ( GLEPP 1 ) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot processes .
This receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process .
To better understand the utility of GLEPP 1 as a marker of <START:Disease> glomerular injury <END> , the amount and distribution of GLEPP 1 protein and mRNA were examined by immunohistochemistry , Western blot and RNase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat .
<START:Chemical> Puromycin aminonucleoside <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> , 20 mg / 100 g BW ) .
Tissues were analyzed at 0 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 21 , 45 , 80 and 126 days after <START:Chemical> PAN <END> injection so as to include both the acute phase of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> associated with foot process effacement ( days 5 - 11 ) and the chronic phase of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> associated with <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> ( days 45 - 126 ) .
At day 5 , GLEPP 1 protein and mRNA were reduced from the normal range ( 265 . 2 + / - 79 . 6 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus and 100 % ) to 15 % of normal ( 41 . 8 + / - 4 . 8 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerulus , p < 0 . 005 ) .
This occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1 . 8 + / - 1 to 99 . 0 + / - 61 mg / day ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
In contrast , podocalyxin did not change significantly at this time .
By day 11 , GLEPP 1 protein and mRNA had begun to return towards baseline .
By day 45 - 126 , at a time when glomerular scarring was present , GLEPP 1 was absent from glomerulosclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of GLEPP 1 was not different from normal .
We conclude that GLEPP 1 expression , unlike podocalyxin , reflects podocyte injury induced by <START:Chemical> PAN <END> .
GLEPP 1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury .
<START:Chemical> Nitro - L - arginine methyl ester <END> : a potential protector against <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> .
The <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) inhibitor <START:Chemical> nitro - L - arginine methyl ester <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ) may act as an otoprotectant against <START:Disease> high - frequency hearing loss <END> caused by <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> , but further studies are needed to confirm this . <START:Chemical> Aminoglycoside <END> antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost .
Their <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> is a serious health problem and , as their <START:Disease> ototoxic <END> mechanism involves the production of <START:Chemical> NO <END> , we need to assess the use of <START:Chemical> NO <END> inhibitors for the prevention of <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> sensorineural hearing loss <END> .
In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague - Dawley rats , 27 of which had <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> instilled into the middle ear .
The otoprotectant <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> was administered topically to 12 / 27 animals .
Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> , measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold .
<START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> reduced <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> in the high - frequency range , but gave no protection in the middle or low frequencies .
Influence of diet free of <START:Chemical> NAD <END> - precursors on <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in mice .
Recently , we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of <START:Chemical> nicotinic acid amide <END> , a selective inhibitor of <START:Chemical> poly ( ADP - ribose ) <END> polymerase ( PARP ; EC 2 . 4 . 2 . 30 ) on mice suffering from <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( <START:Chemical> AAP <END> ) - <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> , suggesting that the <START:Chemical> AAP <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation .
The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of <START:Chemical> NAD <END> , the substrate on which PARP acts , in female NMRI mice with <START:Chemical> AAP <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> and evaluates the influence of simultaneous <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> consumption in these animals .
<START:Disease> Liver injuries <END> were quantified as serum activities of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> - <START:Chemical> oxaloacetate <END> transaminase ( GOT ) and <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> - <START:Chemical> pyruvate <END> transaminase ( GPT ) .
While <START:Chemical> AAP <END> caused a 117 - fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet , which was significantly exacerbated by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> and inhibited by <START:Chemical> nicotinic acid amide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NAA <END> ) , adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of <START:Chemical> NAD <END> .
In these animals , only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of <START:Chemical> AAP <END> , and unlike the exacerbation caused by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> in mice on a standard diet , the <START:Disease> liver damage <END> was inhibited by 50 % by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> .
A further 64 % reduction of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> was observed , when <START:Chemical> NAA <END> was given to <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> / <START:Chemical> AAP <END> - mice .
Our results provide evidence that the <START:Chemical> AAP <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> and its exacerbation by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> can either be reduced by end - product inhibition of PARP by <START:Chemical> NAA <END> or by dietary depletion of the enzyme ' s substrate <START:Chemical> NAD <END> .
We see the main application of <START:Chemical> NAA <END> as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> in order to avoid <START:Disease> hepatic damage <END> in patients treated with this widely used analgesic .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> in freely - moving conscious rats : behavioral approach to a new model of <START:Disease> visceral pain <END> .
PURPOSE : To develop a model of <START:Disease> visceral pain <END> in rats using a behavioral approach .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CP <END> ) , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> , was used to induce <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : <START:Chemical> CP <END> was administered at doses of 50 , 100 and 200 mg . / kg . i . p . to male rats , and their behavior observed and scored .
The effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( 0 . 5 to 4 mg . / kg . i . v . ) on <START:Chemical> CP <END> - induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> ( 1 mg . / kg . s . c . ) .
In addition , 90 minutes after <START:Chemical> CP <END> injection , that is , at the time of administration of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination .
Finally , to show that the bladder is essential for the <START:Chemical> CP <END> - induced behavioral modifications , female rats also received <START:Chemical> CP <END> at doses of 200 mg . / kg . i . p . and of 20 mg . by the intravesical route , and <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> at doses of 0 . 5 mg . by the intravesical route and of 5 mg . / kg . i . v . RESULTS : <START:Chemical> CP <END> dose - relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats : breathing rate decrease , closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> dose - dependently reversed these <START:Disease> behavioral disorders <END> .
A dose of 0 . 5 mg . / kg . produced a reduction of almost 50 % of the behavioral score induced by <START:Chemical> CP <END> 200 mg . / kg .
This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
At the time of administration of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , histological modifications of the bladder wall , such as chorionic and muscle layer <START:Disease> edema <END> , were observed .
In female rats , <START:Chemical> CP <END> 200 mg . / kg . i . p . produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats .
Administered at the dose of 20 mg . intravesically , <START:Chemical> CP <END> did not produce any behavioral effects , whereas <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> at 0 . 5 mg . intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under <START:Chemical> CP <END> 200 mg . / kg . i . p . , with the same maximal levels .
Conversely , <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> 5 mg . / kg . i . v . did not produce any behavioral effects at all .
CONCLUSIONS : Overall , these results indicate that this experimental model of <START:Chemical> CP <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory <START:Disease> visceral pain <END> , allowing a better understanding of these <START:Disease> painful syndromes <END> and thus a better therapeutic approach to them .
<START:Disease> St . Anthony ' s fire <END> , then and now : a case report and historical review .
A rare case of morbid <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> , together with striking angiographic findings , is described secondary to the ingestion of <START:Chemical> methysergide <END> by a 48 - year - old woman .
A brief review of the literature on similar cases is presented .
A discussion of the history of <START:Chemical> ergot <END> includes its original discovery , the epidemics of <START:Disease> gangrene <END> that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of <START:Disease> migraine headache <END> .
Despite the advent of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers and beta - adrenergic antagonists , <START:Chemical> ergot <END> preparations continue to play a major role in <START:Disease> migraine <END> therapy , so that the danger of <START:Disease> St . Anthony ' s fire <END> persists .
<START:Disease> Myoclonic , atonic , and absence seizures <END> following institution of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> therapy in children .
Five children , aged 3 to 11 years , treated with <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> for <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> , had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of <START:Disease> myoclonic , atypical absence and / or atonic ( minor motor ) seizures <END> within a few days .
When the <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> was discontinued , two of the children returned to their former state very quickly , two had the minor motor <START:Disease> seizures <END> resolve in 3 and 6 months , and one had the <START:Disease> seizures <END> persist .
The child in whom the <START:Disease> seizures <END> persisted was later found to have <START:Disease> ceroid lipofuscinosis <END> .
The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants .
Postinfarction <START:Disease> ventricular septal defect <END> associated with long - term <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy .
Two cases of postinfarction <START:Disease> ventricular septal rupture <END> in patients on long - term <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described .
A possible association between <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy and subsequent postinfarction <START:Disease> septal rupture <END> is discussed .
<START:Chemical> Carmofur <END> - induced <START:Disease> organic mental disorders <END> .
<START:Disease> Organic mental disorder <END> was observed in a 29 - year - old female in the prognostic period after the onset of <START:Chemical> carmofur <END> - induced <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> .
Symptoms such as euphoria , emotional lability and puerile attitude noted in the patient were diagnosed as <START:Disease> organic personality syndrome <END> according to the criteria defined in the DSM - III - R .
It is referred to as a <START:Disease> frontal lobe syndrome <END> .
Brain CT revealed a periventricular low density area in the frontal white matter and moderate dilatation of the lateral ventricles especially at the bilateral anterior horns .
Consequently , <START:Chemical> carmofur <END> - induced <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> may uncommonly result in <START:Disease> organic personality syndrome <END> in the residual state .
It may be attributed to the <START:Disease> structural damage to the frontal lobe <END> .
Safety and adverse effects associated with <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> : multiple outcomes of <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> evaluation .
OBJECTIVE : To examine the effect of <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> on major adverse events that occur with postmenopausal <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> therapy or <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
METHODS : The Multiple Outcomes of <START:Chemical> Raloxifene <END> Evaluation , a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial , enrolled 7 , 705 postmenopausal women with <START:Disease> osteoporosis <END> .
Women were randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> 60 mg / d or 120 mg / d or placebo .
Outcomes included <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> , <START:Disease> cataracts <END> , <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> , and <START:Disease> endometrial hyperplasia or cancer <END> .
RESULTS : During a mean follow - up of 3 . 3 years , <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> was associated with an increased risk for <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> ( relative risk [ RR ] 2 . 1 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 2 - 3 . 8 ) .
The excess event rate was 1 . 8 per 1 , 000 woman - years ( 95 % CI - 0 . 5 - 4 . 1 ) , and the number needed to treat to cause 1 event was 170 ( 95 % CI 100 - 582 ) over 3 . 3 years .
Risk in the <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> group was higher than in the placebo group for the first 2 years , but decreased to about the same rate as in the placebo group thereafter .
<START:Chemical> Raloxifene <END> did not increase risk for <START:Disease> cataracts <END> ( RR 0 . 9 ; 95 % CI 0 . 8 - 1 . 1 ) , <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> ( RR 1 . 0 ; 95 % CI 0 . 7 - 1 . 3 ) , <START:Disease> endometrial hyperplasia <END> ( RR 1 . 3 ; 95 % CI 0 . 4 - 5 . 1 ) , or <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> ( RR 0 . 9 ; 95 % CI 0 . 3 - 2 . 7 ) .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Raloxifene <END> was associated with an increased risk for <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> , but there was no increased risk for <START:Disease> cataracts <END> , <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> , <START:Disease> endometrial hyperplasia <END> , or <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> .
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE : I
<START:Chemical> Clarithromycin <END> - associated <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis .
<START:Disease> Visual hallucinations <END> are a rare event in <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> and not related to <START:Disease> uremia <END> per se .
Unreported in the literature is <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> occurring in association with the new <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antibiotic , <START:Chemical> clarithromycin <END> .
We describe such a case in a patient with <START:Disease> end - stage renal disease <END> ( <START:Disease> ESRD <END> ) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
The combination of a relatively high dose of <START:Chemical> clarithromycin <END> in face of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> in a functionally anephric patient , with underlying <START:Chemical> aluminum <END> intoxication , may have facilitated the appearance of this <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> side effect .
It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> , the possibility of drug interactions , and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the <START:Disease> ESRD <END> patient .
Protective effect of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> on <START:Disease> gastric hemorrhagic <END> <START:Disease> ulcers <END> in severe <START:Disease> atherosclerotic <END> rats .
Studies concerning with pathogenesis of <START:Disease> gastric hemorrhage <END> and mucosal ulceration produced in <START:Disease> atherosclerotic <END> rats are lacking .
The aim of this study is to examine the role of gastric acid back - diffusion , mast cell <START:Chemical> histamine <END> release , lipid peroxide ( LPO ) generation and mucosal microvascular permeability in modulating <START:Disease> gastric hemorrhage <END> and <START:Disease> ulcer <END> in rats with <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> induced by coadministration of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> .
Additionally , the protective effect of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> on this <START:Disease> ulcer <END> model was evaluated .
Male Wistar rats were challenged intragastrically once daily for 9 days with 1 . 0 ml / kg of corn oil containing <START:Chemical> vitamin D 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> to induce <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> .
Control rats received corn oil only .
After gastric surgery , rat stomachs were irrigated for 3 h with either simulated gastric juice or normal saline .
Gastric acid back - diffusion , mucosal LPO generation , <START:Chemical> histamine <END> concentration , microvascular permeability , <START:Chemical> luminal <END> hemoglobin content and <START:Disease> ulcer <END> areas were determined .
Elevated <START:Disease> atherosclerotic <END> parameters , such as serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> , total <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> and low - density lipoprotein concentration were obtained in <START:Disease> atherosclerotic <END> rats .
Severe gastric <START:Disease> ulcers <END> accompanied with increased ulcerogenic factors , including gastric acid back - diffusion , <START:Chemical> histamine <END> release , LPO generation and <START:Chemical> luminal <END> hemoglobin content were also observed in these rats .
Moreover , a positive correlation of <START:Chemical> histamine <END> to <START:Disease> gastric hemorrhage <END> and to <START:Disease> ulcer <END> was found in those <START:Disease> atherosclerotic <END> rats .
This <START:Disease> hemorrhagic <END> <START:Disease> ulcer <END> and various ulcerogenic parameters were dose - dependently ameliorated by daily intragastric <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> .
<START:Disease> Atherosclerosis <END> could produce <START:Disease> gastric hemorrhagic <END> <START:Disease> ulcer <END> via aggravation of gastric acid back - diffusion , LPO generation , <START:Chemical> histamine <END> release and microvascular permeability that could be ameliorated by <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> in rats .
Long - term prognosis for transplant - free survivors of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : The prognosis for transplant - free survivors of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> remains unknown .
AIM : To examine whether <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> increases long - term mortality .
METHODS : We followed up all transplant - free survivors of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver injury <END> , hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004 .
We compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the <START:Disease> liver injury <END> led to an <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> and those in whom it did not .
RESULTS : We included 641 patients .
On average , age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> had caused an <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1 . 70 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 - 2 . 85 ) , but the association was age - dependent , and no survivors of <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> died of <START:Disease> liver disease <END> , whereas suicides were frequent in both groups .
These observations speak against long - term effects of <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
More likely , the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of <START:Disease> substance abuse <END> among survivors of <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> did not affect long - term mortality .
Clinical follow - up may be justified by the cause of the <START:Disease> liver failure <END> , but not by the <START:Disease> liver failure <END> itself .
Failure of ancrod in the treatment of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced arterial <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
The morbidity and mortality associated with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> remain high despite numerous empirical therapies .
Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> in patients with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> induced <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> who require brief reexposure to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , but its success in patients who have developed the <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> syndrome is not well defined .
The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Chlorpropamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> .
A 65 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> adult - onset diabetes <END> treated with <START:Chemical> chlorpropamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> Diabenese <END> ) had a <START:Disease> toxic optic neuropathy <END> that resolved with discontinuation of <START:Chemical> chlorpropamide <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Visual loss <END> occurs in <START:Disease> diabetics <END> for a variety of reasons , and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy .
The possibility of a drug - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of <START:Disease> visual loss <END> in <START:Disease> diabetics <END> .
<START:Disease> Postoperative myalgia <END> after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> : no evidence for an inflammatory origin .
A common side effect associated with <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> is <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> .
The pathogenesis of this <START:Disease> myalgia <END> is still unclear ; <START:Disease> inflammation <END> has been suggested but without convincing evidence .
We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this <START:Disease> myalgia <END> .
The incidence and severity of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - associated <START:Disease> myalgia <END> was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> before <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> ( n = 32 for each ) .
Incidence and severity of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> did not differ significantly between the two groups : 15 patients in the <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> group complained of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> compared with 18 patients in the saline group , and severe <START:Disease> myalgia <END> was reported by five patients and three patients , respectively ( not significant ) .
At 48 h after surgery , 12 patients in both groups still suffered from <START:Disease> myalgia <END> ( not significant ) .
In addition , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) as an early marker of <START:Disease> inflammation <END> was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline .
We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients , but only one patient reported <START:Disease> myalgia <END> ; no relationship between <START:Disease> myalgia <END> and the increase of IL - 6 was found .
In conclusion , there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - associated <START:Disease> myalgia <END> .
IMPLICATIONS : Administration of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> before <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - induced <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> .
Furthermore , there was no significant relationship between <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> and time course of interleukin - 6 concentrations , a marker of <START:Disease> inflammation <END> .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> is not justified to prevent <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> .
Severe <START:Disease> ocular and orbital toxicity <END> after intracarotid injection of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> for recurrent <START:Disease> glioblastomas <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Glioblastoma <END> is a <START:Disease> malignant tumor <END> that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood .
With current treatment regimens including combined surgery , radiation and chemotherapy , the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year .
Therefore , patients with <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen .
Generally , <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> is said to have milder side effects than <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , whose <START:Disease> ocular and orbital toxicity <END> are well known .
However , we experienced a case of severe <START:Disease> ocular and orbital toxicity <END> after intracarotid injection of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> , which is infrequently reported .
CASE : A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> for recurrent <START:Disease> glioblastomas <END> in his left temporal lobe .
He complained of <START:Disease> pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye <END> 30 h after the injection .
Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were seen .
RESULTS : He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and <START:Chemical> glycerin <END> for 6 days after the injection .
Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> decreased and <START:Disease> ocular pain <END> diminished , inexorable <START:Disease> papilledema <END> and exudative <START:Disease> retinal detachment <END> continued for 3 weeks .
Finally , 6 weeks later , diffuse <START:Disease> chorioretinal atrophy <END> with <START:Disease> optic atrophy <END> occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost .
CONCLUSION : When performing intracarotid injection of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> , we must be aware of its potentially blinding <START:Disease> ocular toxicity <END> .
It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects .
Role of <START:Chemical> xanthine <END> oxidase in <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in rats .
1 . Glucocorticoid - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> ( GC - <START:Disease> HT <END> ) in the rat is associated with <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> - redox imbalance .
2 .
We studied the role of <START:Chemical> xanthine <END> oxidase ( XO ) , which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species , in <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> ( <START:Chemical> dex <END> - <START:Disease> HT <END> ) .
3 . Thirty male Sprague - Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups : saline , <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> ( <START:Chemical> dex <END> ) , <START:Chemical> allopurinol <END> plus saline , and <START:Chemical> allopurinol <END> plus <START:Chemical> dex <END> .
4 . Systolic blood pressures ( SBP ) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day .
Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity , and serum <START:Chemical> urate <END> to assess XO inhibition .
5 .
<START:Chemical> Dex <END> <START:Disease> increased SBP <END> ( 110 + / - 2 - 126 + / - 3 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ) and <START:Disease> decreased thymus ( P < 0 . 001 ) and bodyweights <END> ( P " < 0 . 01 ) .
<START:Chemical> Allopurinol <END> decreased serum <START:Chemical> urate <END> from 76 + / - 5 to 30 + / - 3 micromol / L ( P < 0 . 001 ) in saline and from 84 + / - 13 to 28 + / - 2 micromol / L in <START:Chemical> dex <END> - treated ( P < 0 . 01 ) groups .
6 . <START:Chemical> Allopurinol <END> did not prevent <START:Chemical> dex <END> - <START:Disease> HT <END> .
This , together with our previous findings that <START:Chemical> allopurinol <END> failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC - <START:Disease> HT <END> in the rat .
High - dose <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> is associated with <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> in postmenopausal women .
OBJECTIVES : To study the long - term effects of androgen treatment on <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> in postmenopausal women .
METHODS : In a population - based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54 - 67 years , we studied the association between self - reported intramuscularly administered high - dose <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> therapy ( <START:Chemical> estradiol - and testosterone esters <END> ) and aortic <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> .
Aortic <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta , which have been shown to reflect intima <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> .
Hormone therapy users were compared with never users .
RESULTS : Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women .
In almost half of these women severe <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> of the aorta was present ( n = 11 ) , while in women without hormone use severe <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> of the aorta was present in less than 20 % ( OR 3 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 8 . 5 , adjusted for age , years since menopause , smoking , and body mass index ) .
The association remained after additional adjustment for <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> level , systolic blood pressure , or <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> use .
No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year .
CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that high - dose <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> therapy may adversely affect <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless .
Neuropeptide - Y immunoreactivity in the <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> model of <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> .
Neuropeptide - Y ( NPY ) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> ( <START:Disease> TLE <END> ) .
This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block <START:Disease> seizure <END> - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices .
The <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PILO <END> ) model of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> is characterized by an acute period of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> followed by spontaneous recurrent <START:Disease> seizures <END> and related <START:Disease> brain damage <END> .
We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model .
<START:Chemical> PILO <END> - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases , within presumed granule cells .
NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas .
In addition , <START:Chemical> PILO <END> injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls .
The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the <START:Chemical> PILO <END> model of <START:Disease> TLE <END> .
However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .
<START:Chemical> 5 - azacytidine <END> potentiates <START:Disease> initiation induced by carcinogens <END> in rat liver .
To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the <START:Disease> initiation of carcinogenic process <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - azacytidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - AzC <END> ) ( 10 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of DNA methylation , was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens , <START:Chemical> benzo [ a ] - pyrene <END> ( 200 mg / kg ) , <START:Chemical> N - methyl - N - nitrosourea <END> ( 60 mg / kg ) and <START:Chemical> 1 , 2 - dimethylhydrazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 1 , 2 - DMH <END> ) ( 100 mg / kg ) .
The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma - glutamyltransferase ( gamma - GT ) positive foci formed following a 2 - week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0 . 02 % <START:Chemical> 2 - acetylaminofluorene <END> coupled with a necrogenic dose of <START:Chemical> CCl 4 <END> .
The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens , administration of <START:Chemical> 5 - AzC <END> during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes , for example 10 - 20 foci / cm 2 in <START:Chemical> 5 - AzC <END> and carcinogen - treated rats compared with 3 - 5 foci / cm 2 in rats treated with carcinogen only .
Administration of <START:Chemical> [ 3 H ] - 5 - azadeoxycytidine <END> during the repair synthesis induced by <START:Chemical> 1 , 2 - DMH <END> further showed that 0 . 019 mol % of <START:Chemical> cytosine <END> residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue , indicating that incorporation of <START:Chemical> 5 - AzC <END> occurs during repair synthesis .
In the absence of the carcinogen , <START:Chemical> 5 - AzC <END> given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy , when its incorporation should be maximum , failed to induce any gamma - GT positive foci .
The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation .
Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation , the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA .
Treatment of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> with a <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> agonist in children .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> , a potent antagonist of both serotonergic ( 5 HT 2 A ) and dopaminergic D 2 receptors is associated with <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in adults and children .
Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with <START:Disease> prolactinomas <END> may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either <START:Disease> delayed puberty <END> or short stature .
These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in youth .
We report the successful treatment of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> in youth .
METHODS : We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> treated with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> .
RESULTS : Four males ( age 6 - 11 years ) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <START:Disease> Mental Disorders <END> ( fourth edition ) <START:Disease> bipolar disorder <END> or <START:Disease> psychoses <END> , with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced elevations in serum prolactin levels ( 57 . 5 - 129 ng / mL , normal 5 - 15 ng / mL ) , were treated with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> ( mean dose 2 . 13 + / - 0 . 09 mg / week ) .
When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects ( mean 11 . 2 + / - 10 . 9 ng / mL ) , the <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> dose was reduced to 1 mg / week in three of four subjects .
The mean duration of therapy with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> was 523 . 5 + / - 129 . 7 days , and the mean duration of therapy with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> was 788 . 5 + / - 162 . 5 days .
<START:Chemical> Cabergoline <END> was well tolerated without adverse effects .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Cabergoline <END> may be useful for the treatment of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in youth ; however , further research is needed .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> causes <START:Disease> memory and learning impairments <END> in rats : involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress , and prevention by <START:Chemical> topiramate <END> .
Different mechanisms have been suggested for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> induced - behaviour is poorly understood .
Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and addiction mechanisms .
Therefore NFkappaB activity , oxidative stress , neuronal <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase ( nNOS ) activity , spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of <START:Chemical> topiramate <END> , a previously proposed therapy for <START:Disease> cocaine addiction <END> , were evaluated in an experimental model of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> administration in rats .
NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> treated rats , as well as <START:Chemical> GSH <END> concentration and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> peroxidase activity in the hippocampus , whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased .
Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex .
In contrast , learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> peroxidase .
These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Topiramate <END> prevented all the alterations observed , showing novel neuroprotective properties .
Detailed spectral profile analysis of <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> in anesthetized rats .
<START:Chemical> Penicillin <END> model is a widely used experimental model for <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> research .
In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats .
Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i . p . <START:Chemical> urethane <END> and connected to an electrocorticogram setup .
After a short period of basal activity recording , <START:Disease> epileptic <END> focus was induced by injecting 400 IU / 2 microl <START:Chemical> penicillin - G potassium <END> into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded .
Basal activity , latent period and the <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis .
Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta , theta ( slow and fast ) , alpha - sigma , beta ( 1 and 2 ) and gamma ( 1 and 2 ) bands .
Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta , theta , beta - 2 and gamma - 2 bands during the <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes ( basal activity , latent period and <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> ) .
Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental <START:Disease> epilepsies <END> .
Gastrointestinal tolerability of <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> in <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> patients : results of the <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> vs <START:Chemical> diclofenac sodium <END> gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial ( EDGE - II ) .
OBJECTIVE : A randomised , double - blind study to compare the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerability , safety and efficacy of <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> and <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RA <END> ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 4086 patients ( mean age 60 . 8 years ) diagnosed with <START:Disease> RA <END> were enrolled and received <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> 90 mg daily ( n = 2032 ) or <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> 75 mg twice daily ( n = 2054 ) .
Use of gastroprotective agents and low - dose <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> was allowed .
The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences ( AEs ) .
General safety was also assessed , including adjudicated <START:Disease> thrombotic cardiovascular <END> event data .
Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status ( PGADS ; 0 - 4 point scale ) .
RESULTS : Mean ( SD ; maximum ) duration of treatment was 19 . 3 ( 10 . 3 ; 32 . 9 ) and 19 . 1 ( 10 . 4 ; 33 . 1 ) months in the <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> and <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> groups , respectively .
The cumulative discontinuation rate due to <START:Disease> GI AEs <END> was significantly lower with <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> than <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> ( 5 . 2 vs 8 . 5 events per 100 patient - years , respectively ; hazard ratio 0 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 , 0 . 81 ; p < or = 0 . 001 )) .
The incidence of discontinuations for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> - related and <START:Disease> oedema <END> - related AEs were significantly higher with <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> ( 2 . 5 % and 1 . 1 % respectively ) compared with <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> ( 1 . 5 % and 0 . 4 % respectively ; p < 0 . 001 for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and p < 0 . 01 for <START:Disease> oedema <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Etoricoxib <END> and <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> treatment resulted in similar efficacy ( PGADS mean changes from baseline - 0 . 62 vs - 0 . 58 , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Etoricoxib <END> 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to <START:Disease> GI AEs <END> compared with <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> 150 mg . Discontinuations from renovascular AEs , although less common than discontinuations from <START:Disease> GI AEs <END> , were significantly higher with <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> .
<START:Disease> Cholestatic jaundice <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> .
We report a patient who developed <START:Disease> cholestatic jaundice <END> shortly after initiation of treatment with <START:Chemical> metformin hydrochloride <END> .
Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal .
An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy .
A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> , with portal <START:Disease> edema <END> , ductular proliferation , and acute <START:Disease> inflammation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Metformin hydrochloride <END> was discontinued , and the patient ' s <START:Disease> jaundice <END> resolved slowly over a period of several months .
Given the onset of his <START:Disease> jaundice <END> 2 wk after the initiation of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> , we believe that this case represents an example of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> - associated <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , the first such case reported .
Oral manifestations of " <START:Disease> meth mouth <END> " : a case report .
AIM : The aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of " <START:Disease> meth mouth <END> " and the medical risks associated with this serious condition .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> is a very addictive , powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as <START:Disease> cardiac dysrhythmias <END> , <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> , and <START:Disease> violent behavior <END> .
Dental patients abusing <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> can present with poor oral hygiene , <START:Disease> xerostomia <END> , rampant <START:Disease> caries <END> ( " <START:Disease> meth mouth <END> " ) , and excessive <START:Disease> tooth wear <END> .
Oral rehabilitation of patients using <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> can be challenging .
CASE DESCRIPTION : A 30 - year - old Caucasian woman presented with dental <START:Disease> pain <END> , <START:Disease> bad breath <END> , and self - reported poor esthetics .
A comprehensive examination including her medical history , panoramic radiograph , and intraoral examination revealed 19 <START:Disease> carious lesions <END> , which is not very common for a healthy adult .
She reported her use of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> for five years and had not experienced any major <START:Disease> carious episodes <END> before she started using the drug .
SUMMARY : The patient ' s medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of " <START:Disease> meth mouth <END> . "
Although three different dental treatment modalities ( either conventional or implant - supported ) have been offered to the patient since August 2007 , the patient has yet to initiate any treatment .
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : This clinical case showing oral manifestations of <START:Disease> meth mouth <END> was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be abusing <START:Chemical> methamphetamines <END> .
Dental practitioners also may be skeptical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients , as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification .
<START:Chemical> Flestolol <END> : an ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent .
<START:Chemical> Flestolol <END> ( <START:Chemical> ACC - 9089 <END> ) is a nonselective , competitive , ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent , without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity .
<START:Chemical> Flestolol <END> is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 5 minutes .
This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms / kg / min .
In long - term infusion studies , <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> was well tolerated at the effective beta - blocking dose ( 5 micrograms / kg / min ) for up to seven days .
<START:Chemical> Flestolol <END> blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> and beta - adrenergic blockade .
<START:Chemical> Flestolol <END> produced a dose - dependent attenuation of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> .
Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> are similar to those of other beta blockers .
In contrast with other beta blockers , <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> - induced effects reverse rapidly ( within 30 minutes ) following discontinuation because of its short half - life .
<START:Chemical> Flestolol <END> effectively reduced heart rate in patients with <START:Disease> supraventricular tachyarrhythmia <END> .
In patients with <START:Disease> unstable angina <END> , <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling <START:Disease> chest pain <END> .
It is concluded that <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> is a potent , well - tolerated , ultra - short - acting beta - adrenergic blocking agent .
Use of <START:Chemical> flestolol <END> in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation .
The use of serum cholinesterase in <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> <START:Disease> apnoea <END> .
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged <START:Disease> apnoea <END> lasting several hours after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase .
Adequate spontaneous respiration was re - established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection .
In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase .
In three patients none of the usual variants were found .
It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> .
The use of serum cholinesterase in <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> <START:Disease> apnoea <END> provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist .
<START:Chemical> Dexrazoxane <END> protects against <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> from the DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> and <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> but not <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
PURPOSE : The <START:Chemical> anthracyclines <END> <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and the <START:Chemical> epipodophyllotoxin <END> <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> are potent DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology ; however , <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> limit their use .
<START:Chemical> Dexrazoxane <END> ( <START:Chemical> ICRF - 187 <END> ) is recommended for protection against <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Because of their widespread use , the <START:Disease> hematologic toxicity <END> following coadministration of <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated : Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> , and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> + / - <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> was determined in granulocyte - macrophage colony forming assays .
Likewise , in vivo , B 6 D 2 F 1 mice were treated with <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> , and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> , with or without <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> over a wide range of doses : posttreatment , a full hematologic evaluation was done .
RESULTS : Nontoxic doses of <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> reduced <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> and <START:Disease> weight loss <END> from <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay ; however , <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> neither reduced <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> , <START:Disease> weight loss <END> , nor the in vitro <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> from <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
CONCLUSION : Although our findings support the observation that <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> clinically , the potent antagonism of <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> activity raises concern ; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention .
Our data also suggest that significant <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> .
Clinical trials in patients with brain <START:Disease> metastases <END> combining <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> and high doses of <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating <START:Disease> hematologic toxicity <END> .
If successful , this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy .
<START:Disease> Veno - occlusive liver disease <END> after <START:Chemical> dacarbazine <END> therapy ( <START:Chemical> DTIC <END> ) for <START:Disease> melanoma <END> .
A case of <START:Disease> veno - occlusive disease of the liver <END> with fatal outcome after <START:Chemical> dacarbazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DTIC <END> ) therapy for <START:Disease> melanoma <END> is reported .
There was a fulminant clinical course from start of symptoms until <START:Disease> death <END> .
At autopsy the liver was enlarged and firm with signs of <START:Disease> venous congestion <END> .
Small - and medium - sized hepatic veins were blocked by <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
Eosinophilic infiltrations were found around the vessels .
Published cases from the literature are reviewed and pertinent features discussed .
Does <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> cause <START:Disease> urothelial cancer <END> or <START:Disease> renal papillary necrosis <END> ?
The risk of developing <START:Disease> renal papillary necrosis <END> or <START:Disease> cancer of the renal pelvis , ureter or bladder <END> associated with consumption of either <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> or <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 808 controls .
The risk of <START:Disease> renal papillary necrosis <END> was increased nearly 20 - fold by consumption of <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> , which also increased the risk for <START:Disease> cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder <END> but not for <START:Disease> ureteric cancer <END> .
By contrast , we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> consumption for <START:Disease> renal papillary necrosis <END> or any of these <START:Disease> cancers <END> although there was a suggestion of an association with <START:Disease> cancer of the ureter <END> .
<START:Disease> Myocardial infarction <END> following sublingual administration of <START:Chemical> isosorbide dinitrate <END> .
A 78 - year - old with healed septal <START:Disease> necrosis <END> suffered a recurrent <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> of the anterior wall following the administration of <START:Chemical> isosorbide dinitrate <END> 5 mg sublingually .
After detailing the course of events , we discuss the role of paradoxical coronary <START:Disease> spasm <END> and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> - mediated <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> occurring downstream to significant <START:Disease> coronary arterial stenosis <END> in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> acute coronary insufficiency <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cyclosporine <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - associated <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> .
The development of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> TMA <END> ) associated with the use of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> has been well documented .
Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange , plasma infusion , anticoagulation , and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion .
However , for recipients of organ transplantation , removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss .
The last decade has seen the emergence of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> .
As a result , switching to <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> - induced <START:Disease> TMA <END> .
With the more widespread application of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> in organ transplantation , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - associated <START:Disease> TMA <END> has also been recognized .
However , literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of <START:Disease> TMA <END> in patients exposed sequentially to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> is limited .
We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> - induced <START:Disease> TMA <END> that responded to the withdrawal of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy .
Introduction of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of <START:Disease> TMA <END> and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft .
Patients who are switched from <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> to <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent <START:Disease> TMA <END> .
Severe <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> patient on <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> presenting with <START:Disease> myxedemic coma <END> : a case report .
This is a case report of <START:Disease> myxedema coma <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> in a patient with severe <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) .
To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of <START:Disease> myxedema coma <END> during long term <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Myxedema coma <END> is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20 % with treatment .
The condition is treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> thyroxine <END> ( <START:Chemical> T 4 <END> ) or intravenous <START:Chemical> tri - iodo - thyronine <END> ( <START:Chemical> T 3 <END> ) .
Patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> on <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> , and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels .
This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> among <START:Disease> CHF <END> patients .
The myriad clinical presentation of <START:Disease> myxedema coma <END> and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among <START:Disease> CHF <END> patients presenting with <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> weakness <END> or other unexplained symptoms .
<START:Chemical> Simvastatin - ezetimibe <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> necessitating liver transplantation .
Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( <START:Chemical> statin <END> ) therapy .
However , <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> events have not been widely published with <START:Chemical> ezetimibe <END> or the combination agent <START:Chemical> simvastatin - ezetimibe <END> .
We describe a 70 - year - old Hispanic woman who developed <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> 40 mg / day to <START:Chemical> simvastatin 10 mg - ezetimibe 40 mg <END> / day .
The patient ' s lipid panel had been maintained with <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> .
A routine laboratory work - up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels .
<START:Chemical> Simvastatinezetimibe <END> and <START:Chemical> escitalopram <END> ( which she was taking for <START:Disease> depression <END> ) were discontinued , and other potential causes of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> were excluded .
A repeat work - up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels , and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate - to - severe <START:Disease> drug toxicity <END> .
She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course .
Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23 , and her 2 - year follow - up showed no adverse events .
<START:Chemical> Ezetimibe <END> undergoes extensive glucuronidation by <START:Chemical> uridine diphosphate <END> glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT ) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of <START:Chemical> simvastatin hydroxy acid <END> , resulting in increased <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> exposure and subsequent <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> .
To our knowledge , this is the first case report of <START:Chemical> simvastatin - ezetimibe <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver failure <END> that resulted in liver transplantation .
We postulate that the mechanism of the <START:Chemical> simvastatinezetimibe <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> is the increased <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> exposure by <START:Chemical> ezetimibe <END> inhibition of UGT enzymes .
Clinicians should be aware of potential <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> with <START:Chemical> simvastatin - ezetimibe <END> especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage .
<START:Disease> Central nervous system complications <END> during treatment of <START:Disease> acute lymphoblastic leukemia <END> in a single pediatric institution .
<START:Disease> Central nervous system ( CNS ) complications <END> during treatment of childhood <START:Disease> acute lymphoblastic leukemia <END> ( <START:Disease> ALL <END> ) remain a challenging clinical problem .
Outcome improvement with more intensive chemotherapy has significantly increased the incidence and severity of adverse events .
This study analyzed the incidence of <START:Disease> neurological complications <END> during <START:Disease> ALL <END> treatment in a single pediatric institution , focusing on clinical , radiological , and electrophysiological findings .
Exclusion criteria included CNS <START:Disease> leukemic infiltration <END> at diagnosis , therapy - related <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> , late - onset <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> , or long - term <START:Disease> neurocognitive defects <END> .
During a 9 - year period , we retrospectively collected 27 neurological events ( 11 % ) in as many patients , from 253 children enrolled in the <START:Disease> ALL <END> front - line protocol .
CNS complications included posterior reversible <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> syndrome ( n = 10 ) , <START:Disease> stroke <END> ( n = 5 ) , <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> ( n = 2 ) , high - dose <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ( n = 2 ) , syndrome of <START:Disease> inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion <END> ( n = 1 ) , and other unclassified events ( n = 7 ) .
In conclusion , CNS complications are frequent events during <START:Disease> ALL <END> therapy , and require rapid detection and prompt treatment to limit permanent damage .
<START:Chemical> Serotonergic antidepressants <END> and <START:Disease> urinary incontinence <END> .
Many new <START:Chemical> serotonergic antidepressants <END> have been introduced over the past decade .
Although <START:Disease> urinary incontinence <END> is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature .
This concerns 2 male patients who experienced <START:Disease> incontinence <END> while taking <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> .
In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed <START:Disease> incontinence <END> secondary to the selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitors <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> , as well as a third who developed this side effect on <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> .
In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking <START:Chemical> lithium carbonate <END> and beta - blockers , both of which could have contributed to the <START:Disease> incontinence <END> .
Animal studies suggest that <START:Disease> incontinence <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> serotonergic antidepressants <END> could be mediated by the 5 HT 4 receptors found on the bladder .
Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it .
<START:Disease> Angioedema <END> following the intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
A 72 - year - old woman was admitted to the hospital with " flash " <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> , preceded by <START:Disease> chest pain <END> , requiring intubation .
Her medical history included <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> with previous <START:Disease> myocardial infarctions <END> , <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , and <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> .
A history of <START:Disease> angioedema <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> lisinopril <END> therapy was elicited .
Current medications did not include <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitors or beta - blockers .
She had no previous beta - blocking drug exposure .
During the first day of hospitalization ( while intubated ) , intravenous <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> was given , resulting in severe <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
The <START:Disease> angioedema <END> resolved after therapy with intravenous <START:Chemical> steroids <END> and <START:Chemical> diphenhydramine <END> hydrochloride .
Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on <START:Chemical> bupropion hydrochloride <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice .
BACKGROUND : It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
This is important , since different controlled release formulations of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> release the active drug at different rates .
METHODS : We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg , a known <START:Disease> convulsive <END> dose 50 ( CD 50 ) , on the incidence and severity of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in the Swiss albino mice .
A total of 69 mice , approximately 7 weeks of age , and weighing 21 . 0 to 29 . 1 g were randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg treatment by intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration in 7 groups ( 9 to 10 animals per group ) .
<START:Chemical> Bupropion HCl <END> was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min , 15 min , 30 min , 60 min , 90 min , 120 min , and 240 min .
The number , time of onset , duration and the intensity of the <START:Disease> convulsions <END> or absence of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> were recorded .
RESULTS : The results showed that IP administration of <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg by bolus injection induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in 6 out of 10 mice ( 60 % of convulsing mice ) in group 1 . Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant ( p = 0 . 0004 ; odds ratio = 0 . 974 ) and increasing the IP infusion time of <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg was associated with a 91 % reduced odds of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection .
Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> to 99 . 8 % reduction at 240 min .
CONCLUSION : In conclusion , the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and <START:Disease> convulsive <END> dose of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and the risk of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in a prospective study is novel .
<START:Disease> Cardiac arrest <END> after intravenous <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> - a case of five repeated injections of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> causing five episodes of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> .
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> was immediately followed by <START:Disease> asystole <END> repeatedly .
The patient received <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> 10 mg i . v . five times during 48 h .
After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation , it is clear that every administration of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> was immediately ( within s ) followed by <START:Disease> asystole <END> .
The <START:Disease> asystole <END> lasted 15 - 30 s on four occasions , on one occasion it lasted 2 min .
The patient received <START:Chemical> atropine <END> 0 . 5 - 1 mg and chest compressions , before sinus rhythm again took over .
We interpret this as episodes of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> caused by <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> .
The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction .
<START:Disease> Encephalopathy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> levetiracetam <END> added to <START:Chemical> valproate <END> .
BACKGROUND : We report on the manifestation of a <START:Chemical> levetiracetam <END> ( <START:Chemical> LEV <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> .
FINDINGS : A 28 - year - old man suffering from <START:Disease> idiopathic epilepsy <END> with generalized <START:Disease> seizures <END> was treated with <START:Chemical> LEV <END> ( 3000 mg ) added to <START:Chemical> valproate <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) ( 2000 mg ) .
Frequency of generalized <START:Disease> tonic - clonic seizures <END> increased from one per 6 months to two per month .
Neuropsychological testing showed <START:Disease> impaired word fluency , psychomotor speed and working memory <END> .
The interictal electroencephalogram ( EEG ) showed a generalized slowing to 5 per second theta rhythms with bilateral generalized high - amplitude discharges .
OUTCOME : Following discontinuation of <START:Chemical> LEV <END> , EEG and neuropsychological findings improved and <START:Disease> seizure <END> frequency decreased .
Epileptogenic activity of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> after drug induces <START:Disease> SLE <END> ( <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> and <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> )
OBJECTIVE : To study the effect of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> - containing multivitamin supplementation in <START:Disease> epileptic <END> women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural <START:Disease> birth defects <END> and <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - related side effects .
STUDY DESIGN : First a randomised trial , later periconception care including in total 12225 females .
RESULTS : Of 60 <START:Disease> epileptic <END> women with periconceptional <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> ( 0 . 8 mg ) - containing multivitamin supplementation , no one developed <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - related side effects during the periconception period .
One <START:Disease> epileptic <END> woman delivered a newborn with <START:Disease> cleft lip and palate <END> .
Another patient exhibited with a cluster of <START:Disease> seizures <END> after the periconception period using another multivitamin .
This 22 - year - old <START:Disease> epileptic <END> woman was treated continuously by <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> and a <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> ( 1 mg ) - containing multivitamin from the 20 th week of gestation .
She developed <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> and later symptoms of <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematodes <END> .
Her pregnancy ended with <START:Disease> stillbirth <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : The <START:Disease> epileptic <END> pregnant patient ' s <START:Disease> autoimmune disease <END> ( probably drug - induced <START:Disease> lupus <END> ) could damage the blood - brain barrier , therefore the therapeutic dose ( > or = 1 mg ) of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> triggered a cluster of <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Physiological dose ( < 1 mg ) of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> both in healthy and 60 <START:Disease> epileptic <END> women , all without any <START:Disease> autoimmune disease <END> , did not increase the risk for <START:Disease> epileptic seizures <END> .
Tolerability of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in patients with <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in subjects with cutaneous , respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by <START:Chemical> nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs <END> ( <START:Chemical> NSAIDs <END> ) .
In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well - documented history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
Furthermore , we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> and <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> .
A single - placebo - controlled oral challenge procedure with <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> or <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> was applied to 829 patients with a history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
A total of 75 / 829 ( 9 . 4 % ) patients experienced reactions to <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> or <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> .
Of the 715 patients tested with <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> 62 ( 8 . 6 % ) showed a positive test , while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> , 13 ( 9 . 6 % ) did not tolerate this drug .
Furthermore , 18 . 28 % of patients with a history of chronic <START:Disease> urticaria <END> and 11 . 8 % of subjects with an history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> or <START:Disease> angioedema <END> alone ( with or without chronic <START:Disease> urticaria <END> ) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs .
Taken together , our results confirm the good tolerability of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in patients who experienced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> caused by <START:Chemical> NSAIDs <END> .
However , the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic <START:Disease> urticaria <END> and , above all , by a history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
Epileptogenic properties of <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and their clinical interpretation .
Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> anesthesia are reported .
In one patient , <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Until the cause of the <START:Disease> seizures <END> was correctly identified , the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants .
Two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized <START:Disease> seizures <END> uncontrolled by medication .
<START:Disease> Epileptic <END> foci delineated and activated by <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> were surgically ablated and the patients are now <START:Disease> seizure <END> - free .
Previous exposures to <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG .
On the other hand , <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of <START:Disease> epileptic <END> foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings .
Safety of transesophageal echocardiography in adults : study in a multidisciplinary hospital .
BACKGROUND : TEE is a semi - invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety .
OBJECTIVE : to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of <START:Chemical> Midazolan <END> ( <START:Chemical> MZ <END> ) and <START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> ( <START:Chemical> FL <END> ) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate .
METHOD : prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with <START:Chemical> MZ <END> associated to moderate sedation .
We analyzed the following events : complications related with the topical anesthesia , with <START:Chemical> MZ <END> use and with the procedure .
Uni - and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables : age , sex , <START:Disease> stroke <END> , <START:Disease> myocardiopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> MP <END> ) , duration of the test , <START:Disease> mitral regurgitation <END> ( <START:Disease> MR <END> ) and the <START:Chemical> MZ <END> dose .
RESULTS : All patients ( 65 + / - 16 yrs ; 58 % males ) finished the examination .
The mean doses of <START:Chemical> MZ <END> and <START:Chemical> FL <END> were 4 . 3 + / - 1 . 9 mg and 0 . 28 + / - 0 . 2 mg , respectively .
The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction ( EF ) were 16 . 4 + / - 6 . 1 minutes and 60 + / - 9 % , respectively .
Mild <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> ( SO 2 < 90 % ) was the most common event ( 11 patients ) ; 3 patients ( 2 % ) presented transient <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> due to upper <START:Disease> airway obstruction <END> by probe introduction and 8 ( 5 . 8 % ) due to <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> caused by <START:Chemical> MZ <END> use .
Transient <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( SAP < 90 mmHg ) occurred in 1 patient ( 0 . 7 % ) .
The multivariate analysis showed that severe <START:Disease> MR <END> , <START:Disease> MP <END> ( EF < 45 % ) and high doses of <START:Chemical> MZ <END> ( > 5 mg ) were associated with events ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
The EF was 40 % , in the group with <START:Disease> MP <END> and 44 % in the group with severe <START:Disease> MR <END> and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group .
CONCLUSION : TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events .
There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations .
Age - dependent sensitivity of the rat to <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> .
<START:Chemical> Streptomycin <END> sulfate ( 300 mg / kg s . c . ) was injected for various periods into preweanling rats and for 3 weeks into weanling rats .
Beginning at 8 days of age , body movement and hearing were examined for 6 and up to 17 weeks , respectively .
<START:Disease> Abnormal movements <END> and <START:Disease> deafness <END> occurred only in rats treated during the preweaning period ; within this period the greatest sensitivities for these abnormalities occurred from 2 to 11 - 17 and 5 to 11 days of age , respectively , indicating that the cochlea is more sensitive to <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> than the site ( vestibular or central ) responsible for the <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Drug - induced arterial <START:Disease> spasm <END> relieved by <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> .
Case report .
Following major intracranial surgery in a 35 - year - old man , <START:Chemical> sodium pentothal <END> was intravenously infused to minimize <START:Disease> cerebral ischaemia <END> .
Intense <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> with threatened <START:Disease> gangrene <END> arose in the arm used for the infusion .
Since the cranial condition precluded use of more usual methods , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> was given intra - arterially , with careful cardiovascular monitoring , to counteract the <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> .
The treatment was rapidly successful .
<START:Chemical> Ethopropazine <END> and <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> in neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> .
In a 12 - week controlled study <START:Chemical> ethopropazine <END> was compared to <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> induced by <START:Chemical> fluphenazine enanthate <END> in 60 <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> outpatients .
<START:Chemical> Ethopropazine <END> and <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> were found to be equally effective in controlling <START:Disease> parkinsonian symptoms <END> and were as efficacious as <START:Chemical> procyclidine <END> , their previous antiparkinsonian drug .
However , <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> treated patients had a significant increase in <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> compared to their condition during <START:Chemical> procyclindine <END> treatment , and significantly more <START:Disease> anxiety <END> and <START:Disease> depression <END> than <START:Chemical> ethopropazine <END> treated patients .
This suggests that <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian symptoms <END> , because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect .
Age and renal clearance of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
In 35 patients ( ages 20 to 86 yr ) receiving <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> by high - pressure liquid chromatography and for <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cimetidine <END> clearance decreased with age .
The extrapolated 6 - hr serum concentration of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> per unit dose , after intravenous <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> , increased with age of the patients .
The ratio of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> clearance to <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance ( Rc ) averaged 4 . 8 + / - 2 . 0 , indicating net tubular secretion for <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> , suggesting that secretion of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> is a saturable process .
There was only one case of <START:Disease> dementia <END> possibly due to <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> ( with a drug level of 1 . 9 microgram / ml 6 hr after a dose ) in a group of 13 patients without <START:Disease> liver or kidney disease <END> who had <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> levels above 1 . 25 microgram / ml .
Thus , high <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> levels alone do not always induce <START:Disease> dementia <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiovascular complications <END> associated with <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> treatment for <START:Disease> preterm labor <END> .
Severe <START:Disease> cardiovascular complications <END> occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> for <START:Disease> preterm labor <END> .
Associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gestations appear to be predisposing factors .
Potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology are briefly discussed .
A phase I / II study of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> plus <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> as first - line therapy for <START:Disease> head and neck cancers <END> : preliminary results .
Improved outcomes among patients with <START:Disease> head and neck carcinomas <END> require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy .
Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single - agent <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> ( <START:Chemical> Taxol <END> ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) reported a 37 % response rate in patients with <START:Disease> head and neck cancer <END> , and the <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> / <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> patients .
We initiated a phase I / II trial to determine the response and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of escalating <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> doses combined with fixed - dose <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> with granulocyte colony - stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable <START:Disease> head and neck carcinoma <END> .
To date , 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial .
Primary <START:Disease> tumor <END> sites were oropharynx , 10 patients ; hypopharynx , four ; larynx , two ; oral cavity , three ; unknown primary , two ; and nasal cavity and parotid gland , one each .
Of 20 patients evaluable for <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease .
Treatment , given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles , consisted of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> by 3 - hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( 75 mg / m 2 ) .
The dose levels incorporate escalating <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> doses , and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if <START:Disease> toxicity <END> permits .
At the time of this writing , dose level 4 ( 260 , 270 , and 280 mg / m 2 ) is being evaluated ; three patients from this level are evaluable .
With <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> doses of 200 mg / m 2 and higher , granulocyte colony - stimulating factor 5 micrograms / kg / d is given ( days 4 through 12 ) .
Of 18 patients evaluable for response , seven ( 39 % ) achieved a complete response and six ( 33 % ) achieved a partial response .
Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two .
The overall response rate is 72 % .
Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery / radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy .
Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses .
<START:Disease> Alopecia <END> , <START:Disease> paresthesias <END> , and <START:Disease> arthralgias <END> / <START:Disease> myalgias <END> have occurred frequently , but with one exception ( a grade 3 <START:Disease> myalgia <END> ) they have been grade 1 or 2 .
No dose - limiting hematologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> has been seen .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> / <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> is an effective first - line regimen for locoregionally advanced <START:Disease> head and neck cancer <END> and continued study is warranted .
Results thus far suggest no dose - response effect for <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> doses above 200 mg / m 2 .
<START:Disease> Ocular and auditory toxicity <END> in hemodialyzed patients receiving <START:Chemical> desferrioxamine <END> .
During an 18 - month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving <START:Chemical> desferrioxamine <END> ( 10 - 40 mg / kg BW / 3 times weekly ) for the first time were monitored for detection of <START:Disease> audiovisual toxicity <END> .
6 patients presented clinical symptoms of <START:Disease> visual or auditory toxicity <END> .
Moreover , detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients .
<START:Disease> Visual toxicity <END> was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan - type <START:Disease> dyschromatopsy <END> , sometimes associated with <START:Disease> a loss of visual acuity <END> and <START:Disease> pigmentary retinal deposits <END> .
<START:Disease> Auditory toxicity <END> was characterized by a mid - to high - frequency <START:Disease> neurosensorial hearing loss <END> and the lesion was of the cochlear type .
<START:Chemical> Desferrioxamine <END> withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3 , and a complete reversal of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3 .
This <START:Disease> toxicity <END> appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of <START:Chemical> desferrioxamine <END> or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or <START:Chemical> aluminium <END> serum levels .
The data indicate that <START:Disease> audiovisual toxicity <END> is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving <START:Chemical> desferrioxamine <END> .
Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible .
<START:Chemical> Ticlopidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> : report of three Chinese patients and review of the literature .
In this study , three Chinese patients with <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> were reported and another 13 patients in the English literature were reviewed .
We attempted to find underlying similarities , evaluate the risk factors , and identify appropriate treatment for this complication .
All but one of the patients were over 60 years old , and the 6 who died were all older than 65 .
Therefore , old age may be a risk factor for developing this complication .
<START:Disease> Agranulocytosis <END> occurred 3 - 20 weeks after initiation of <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> , so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recommended .
There seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of <START:Disease> bone marrow suppression <END> .
Treatment for <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> with colony - stimulating factors seemed to have little effect .
The fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers died , should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously .
Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> induces a self - perpetuating <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> characterized by early <START:Disease> glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions <END> in rats .
We investigated the potential role of <START:Disease> mitochondrial injury <END> in the onset of these lesions .
METHODS : Rats were treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 mg kg ( - 1 ) week ( - 1 )) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ( ' short - term ' ) or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ' ) following the last dose .
Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia .
All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age .
<START:Disease> Glomerular and tubular injury <END> was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components .
Finally , we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) as well as <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion .
RESULTS : The ' long - term ' group had significant <START:Disease> glomerular and tubular lesions <END> , depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX ) and increased <START:Chemical> citrate <END> synthase activity .
In addition , expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased .
In ' short - term ' rats , there were fewer <START:Disease> tubular lesions <END> , but similar numbers of <START:Disease> glomerular lesions <END> activity .
Among all animals , <START:Disease> glomerular and tubular injury <END> were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels , mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain subunit COX - I .
Injury was positively correlated with <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes .
Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups .
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal lesions <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ginsenoside Rg 1 <END> restores the <START:Disease> impairment of learning <END> induced by chronic <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration in rats .
<START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> , as a <START:Chemical> ginsenoside <END> extracted from Panax ginseng , could ameliorate spatial <START:Disease> learning impairment <END> .
Previous studies have demonstrated that <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> on <START:Disease> learning impairment <END> by chronic <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect .
Male rats were subcutaneously injected with <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> once a day for 10 days .
Spatial learning capacity was assessed in the Morris water maze .
The results showed that rats treated with <START:Chemical> Morphine <END> / <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency .
By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP ) impaired by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats .
The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline - or <START:Chemical> morphine <END> / <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> - treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> MK 801 <END> .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> Rg 1 <END> may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration and restore the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - inhibited LTP .
This effect is <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor dependent .
<START:Disease> Hypoxia <END> in <START:Disease> renal disease <END> with <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and / or glomerular <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level , relatively few methods have been available .
In this study , we developed a new <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - responsive reporter vector using a <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - responsive element of the 5 ' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - sensing transgenic rat .
We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> in the <START:Disease> diseased kidney <END> .
With this model , we were able to identify diffuse cortical <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> in the <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> and focal and segmental <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> in the remnant kidney model .
Expression of the <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period , reaching 2 . 2 - fold at 2 weeks in the <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> model and 2 . 6 - fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model , whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease , reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes .
The degree of <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> showed a positive correlation with microscopic <START:Disease> tubulointerstitial injury <END> in both models .
Finally , we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive , ED - 1 - positive , and terminal dUTP nick - end labeled - positive cells in the <START:Disease> hypoxic <END> cortical area in the remnant kidney model .
We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> and progressive <START:Disease> glomerular diseases <END> .
Anxiogenic potential of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> in rats .
INTRODUCTION : The possible anxiogenic effects of <START:Chemical> fluoroquinolones <END> , namely <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> , were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex , weighing 150 - 200 g .
METHODS : The drugs were given orally , in doses of 50 mg / kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day .
The tests included open - field exploratory behaviour , elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze , social interaction and novelty - suppressed feeding latency behaviour .
RESULTS : The results indicate that <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> - treated rats showed <START:Disease> anxious behaviour <END> in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied .
However , <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> - treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters .
CONCLUSION : The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> .
The use and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> didanosine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ddI <END> ) in <START:Disease> HIV antibody - positive <END> individuals intolerant to <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> )
One hundred and fifty - one patients intolerant to <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) received <START:Chemical> didanosine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ddI <END> ) to a maximum dose of 12 . 5 mg / kg / day .
Patient response was assessed using changes in CD 4 + lymphocyte subset count , HIV p 24 antigen , weight , and quality of life .
Seventy patients developed major <START:Disease> opportunistic infections <END> whilst on therapy ; this was the first <START:Disease> AIDS <END> diagnosis in 17 .
Only minor changes in CD 4 + lymphocyte subset count were observed in <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patients , although a more significant rise occurred in those with earlier stages of disease .
Of those positive for p 24 antigen at the commencement of the study 67 % showed a positive response , and this was most likely in those with CD 4 + lymphocyte subset counts above 100 mm 3 .
A positive weight response was seen in 16 % of patients .
Most patients showed improvement in individual parameters and global score of quality of life .
Adverse reactions possibly attributable to <START:Chemical> didanosine <END> were common .
The most common side - effect was <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> , which resulted in cessation of therapy in 19 individuals .
<START:Disease> Peripheral neuropathy <END> occurred in 12 patients and <START:Disease> pancreatitis <END> in six .
Thirteen patients developed a raised serum amylase without <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> .
Seven patients developed <START:Disease> glucose tolerance curves <END> characteristic of <START:Disease> diabetes <END> but these were mild , did not require treatment and returned to normal on ceasing <START:Chemical> didanosine <END> .
<START:Disease> Angioedema <END> due to <START:Chemical> ACE inhibitors <END> : common and inadequately diagnosed .
The estimated incidence of <START:Disease> angioedema <END> during <START:Chemical> angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor <END> treatment is between 1 and 7 per thousand patients .
This potentially serious adverse effect is often preceded by minor manifestations that may serve as a warning .
<START:Disease> Catalepsy <END> induced by combinations of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> : potentiation , antagonism , tolerance and cross - tolerance in the rat .
Previous studies demonstrated that both <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> induced <START:Disease> analgesia <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in the rat .
Pre - treatment with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> produced cross - tolerance to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , whereas pretreatment with <START:Chemical> morphine <END> did not induce cross - tolerance to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> but rather augmented the <START:Disease> cataleptic <END> response ; this augmentation was attributed to residual <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in the brain .
The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub - effective doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , administered simultaneously .
There was mutual potentiation between sub - effective doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , but sub - effective doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> partly antagonized fully - effective doses of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Latency to the loss of righting reflex , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> and behavior on recovery , reflected the relative predominance of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> or <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in each combination .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> inhibited the induced <START:Disease> cataleptic <END> effects .
The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub - effective dose combinations of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> were similar .
Rats , tolerant to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - dominant combinations , were cross - tolerant to both drugs , while those tolerant to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - dominant combinations were cross - tolerant to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> but showed either no cross - tolerance or an augmented response to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
While the mutual potentiation , antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , differences in latency , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> and behavior , asymmetry of cross - tolerance and a widely - different ID 50 for <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> would argue against an action at a single opioid site .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> combined with <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> in the first - line treatment of advanced <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> .
In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> ( <START:Chemical> Taxol <END> ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) given as a 3 - hour infusion in combination with <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> administered every 21 days to women with advanced <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> , <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> doses were escalated as follows : level 1 , 135 mg / m 2 ; level 2 , 160 mg / m 2 ; level 3 , 185 mg / m 2 ; and level 4 , 210 mg / m 2 .
The fixed dose of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) of 5 using the Calvert formula .
In levels 5 and 6 the <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7 . 5 , respectively , combined with a fixed <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> dose of 185 mg / m 2 .
To date , 30 previously untreated patients , all with a good performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2 ) have been entered into this ongoing study .
The dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of the combination was <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> ( <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> , <START:Disease> granulocytopenia <END> , and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxicity <END> was largely moderate .
So far , 14 patients are evaluable for response ; of these , eight ( 57 % ) showed objective ( complete or partial ) response and disease stabilized in six patients .
No patient had disease progression .
We conclude that the combination of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> 185 mg / m 2 administered as a 3 - hour infusion followed immediately by a 1 - hour infusion of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21 - day schedule in the outpatient setting .
The recommended dose for phase III studies is <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> 185 mg / m 2 and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> AUC 6 .
Definition and management of <START:Disease> anemia <END> in patients <START:Disease> infected with hepatitis C virus <END> .
<START:Disease> Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus <END> ( HCV ) can progress to <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> , <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> , and <START:Disease> end - stage liver disease <END> .
The current best treatment for <START:Disease> HCV infection <END> is combination therapy with pegylated <START:Chemical> interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs ) in approximately 50 % of patients , it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> , and this <START:Disease> anemia <END> can be problematic in patients with <START:Disease> HCV infection <END> , especially those who have comorbid <START:Disease> renal or cardiovascular disorders <END> .
In general , <START:Disease> anemia <END> can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality , and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life .
Although <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - associated <START:Disease> anemia <END> can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation , this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates .
Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - associated <START:Disease> anemia <END> but has other potential disadvantages .
<START:Chemical> Viramidine <END> , a liver - targeting prodrug of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> while decreasing the risk of <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> in patients with <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> .
Further studies on effects of irrigation solutions on rat bladders .
Further studies on the effects of certain irrigating fluids on the rat bladder for 18 hours are reported .
The results have shown that the degradation product <START:Chemical> p - choloroaniline <END> is not a significant factor in <START:Chemical> chlorhexidine - digluconate <END> associated erosive <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
A high percentage of <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> - <START:Chemical> colistin <END> and <START:Chemical> povidone - iodine <END> irrigations were associated with erosive <START:Disease> cystitis <END> and suggested a possible complication with human usage .
<START:Chemical> Picloxydine <END> irrigations appeared to have a lower incidence of erosive <START:Disease> cystitis <END> but further studies would have to be performed before it could be recommended for use in urological procedures .
Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> rats , and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings .
BACKGROUND : Cardiac troponins I ( cTnI ) and T ( cTnT ) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of <START:Disease> myocardial cell injury <END> .
We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> in a rat model of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of <START:Disease> cardiac disorders <END> monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model .
METHODS : Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1 . 5 mg / kg <START:Chemical> DOX <END> , i . v . , weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg / kg BW .
Ten rats received saline as a control group .
cTnI was measured with Access ( R ) ( ng / ml ) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml ) , and compared with cTnT , CK - MB mass and CK .
By using transthoracic echocardiography , anterior and posterior wall thickness , LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS ) were measured in all rats before <START:Chemical> DOX <END> or saline , and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats .
Histology was performed in <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last <START:Chemical> DOX <END> dose and in all controls .
RESULTS : Eighteen of the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> rats died prematurely of general <START:Disease> toxicity <END> during the 9 - week period .
End - diastolic ( ED ) and end - systolic ( ES ) LV diameters / BW significantly increased , whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
These parameters remained unchanged in controls .
Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given <START:Chemical> DOX <END> revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> .
In 7 of the 18 rats , degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found .
Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> .
A significant rise in cTnT was found in <START:Chemical> DOX <END> rats after cumulative doses of 7 . 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
cTnT found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7 . 5 mg / kg <START:Chemical> DOX <END> .
Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml ) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in <START:Chemical> DOX <END> rats compared with controls ( p = 0 . 006 , 0 . 007 ) .
cTnI ( ng / ml ) , CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in <START:Chemical> DOX <END> rats compared with controls .
All markers remained stable in controls .
Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0 . 81 and 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes , and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings .
CONCLUSIONS : Among markers of <START:Disease> ischemic injury <END> after <START:Chemical> DOX <END> in rats , cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes .
Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after <START:Chemical> DOX <END> , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after <START:Chemical> DOX <END> indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and possibly for cardioprotective experiments .
Acute blood pressure elevations with <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in men with borderline systemic <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> are enhanced in <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> persons has not been demonstrated .
Thus , <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years ) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions .
Borderline <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( BP ) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and / or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg .
Low - risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and had screening BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg .
Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits .
<START:Chemical> Caffeine <END> - induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8 . 4 vs + 3 . 8 mm Hg , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45 dynes . s . cm - 5 , p < 0 . 004 ) .
These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols .
The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % .
Consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> BP levels after <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ingestion .
Thus , in borderline <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> men , exaggerated responses to <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> were : selective for diastolic BP , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative of nearly all borderline <START:Disease> hypertensives <END> .
We suspect that the potential for <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment .
Increased frequency of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> with the combination of <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in patients with metastatic androgen - independent <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the frequency of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> ( <START:Disease> VTE <END> ) in patients with advanced androgen - independent <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> who were treated with <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> alone or in combination with <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> .
DESIGN : Retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial .
SETTING : National Institutes of Health clinical research center .
PATIENTS : Seventy men , aged 50 - 80 years , with advanced androgen - independent <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> .
INTERVENTION : Each patient received either intravenous <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> 30 mg / m 2 / week for 3 consecutive weeks , followed by 1 week off , or the combination of continuous oral <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> 200 mg every evening plus the same <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> regimen .
This 4 - week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive <START:Disease> toxicity <END> or disease progression .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : None of 23 patients who received <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> alone developed <START:Disease> VTE <END> , whereas 9 of 47 patients ( 19 % ) who received <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> plus <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> developed <START:Disease> VTE <END> ( p = 0 . 025 ) .
CONCLUSION : The addition of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> to <START:Chemical> docetaxel <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> significantly increases the frequency of <START:Disease> VTE <END> .
Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> to chemotherapeutic regimens .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> induced by combined <START:Chemical> levomepromazine <END> - <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> treatment .
We report a case of combined <START:Chemical> levomepromazine <END> - <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> treatment - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
It seems that combined treatment of <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> with <START:Chemical> phenothiazines <END> may possess proconvulsive activity .
Nightmares and <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> after long - term intake of <START:Chemical> tramadol <END> combined with antidepressants .
<START:Chemical> Tramadol <END> is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat <START:Disease> cancer <END> <START:Disease> pain <END> and chronic non malignant <START:Disease> pain <END> .
This drug was initiated in association with <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> dosulepine hydrochloride <END> in a <START:Disease> tetraparetic <END> patient with <START:Disease> chronic pain <END> .
Fifty - six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho - active drugs and <START:Chemical> tramadol <END> .
The case report questions the long term use of <START:Disease> pain <END> killers combined with psycho - active drugs in chronic non malignant <START:Disease> pain <END> , especially if <START:Disease> pain <END> is under control .
Acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> attack after exposure to <START:Chemical> telithromycin <END> .
INTRODUCTION : Antibiotic - associated <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> is rare .
With widespread use of antimicrobial agents , however , <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> occurs frequently , and among <START:Disease> adverse drug reactions <END> , idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious .
CASE SUMMARY : A 25 - year - old male patient , with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department , Istanbul , Turkey , with 5 days ' history of <START:Disease> jaundice <END> , malaise , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> .
He had been prescribed <START:Chemical> telithromycin <END> 400 mg / d PO to treat an <START:Disease> upper respiratory tract infection <END> 7 days prior .
Admission laboratory tests were as follows : <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase , 67 U / L ( reference range , 10 - 37 U / L ) ; <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> aminotransferase , 98 U / L ( 10 - 40 U / L ) ; alkaline phosphatase , 513 U / L ( 0 - 270 U / L ) ; gamma - glutamyltransferase , 32 U / L ( 7 - 49 U / L ) ; amylase , 46 U / L ( 0 - 220 U / L ) ; total <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> , 20 . 1 mg / dL ( 0 . 2 - 1 . 0 mg / dL ) ; direct <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> , 14 . 8 mg / dL ( 0 - 0 . 3 mg / dL ) ; and albumin , 4 . 7 mg / dL ( 3 . 5 - 5 . 4 mg / dL ) .
No toxin , <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> , or other drugs were reported .
The patient had suffered a previous episode of " acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> of unknown origin , " that occurred after <START:Chemical> telithromycin <END> usage .
Both incidents occurred within a year .
DISCUSSION : <START:Chemical> Telithromycin <END> is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use .
It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe <START:Disease> hepatic dysfunction <END> .
Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo <START:Disease> adverse drug reaction <END> probability scale , <START:Chemical> telithromycin <END> was the probable cause of acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> in this patient , and pathological findings suggested drug - induced <START:Disease> toxic hepatitis <END> .
Recurrence of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed <START:Chemical> telithromycin <END> the second time .
CONCLUSION : Here we report a case of acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> probably associated with the administration of <START:Chemical> telithromycin <END> .
MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> in organ transplant patients .
Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion - weighted ( DW ) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> therapy .
Brain MR studies , including DW imaging , were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> who developed <START:Disease> neurologic complications <END> .
In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study , a follow - up MR study was performed 1 month later .
Apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions .
Of the 14 patients , 5 ( 35 . 7 % ) had <START:Disease> white matter abnormalities <END> , 1 ( 7 . 1 % ) had <START:Disease> putaminal hemorrhage <END> , and 8 ( 57 . 1 % ) had normal findings on initial MR images .
Among the 5 patients with <START:Disease> white matter abnormalities <END> , 4 patients ( 80 . 0 % ) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images , and all showed complete resolution on follow - up images .
The remaining 1 patient ( 20 . 0 % ) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with <START:Disease> cortical laminar necrosis <END> .
Diffusion - weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Selective injection of <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> , <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> and <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> into the left coronary artery of the dog .
Induction of <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> and decrease of aortic pressure .
In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> , <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> and <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> in doses of 4 ml , 8 ml and 16 ml . Thirty - six <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> injections , 35 <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> injections and 37 <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> injections were made .
Frequencies of <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> were significantly lower ( p less than 0 . 05 ) after <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> ( 0 % ) and <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> ( 3 % ) than after <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> ( 22 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Iopentol <END> and <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> at the different doses .
Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> in F 344 rats .
<START:Disease> Renal papillary necrosis <END> ( <START:Disease> RPN <END> ) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long - term treatment with <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in female Fischer 344 rats .
Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks , when no analgesics were given , to investigate whether the analgesic - induced changes were reversible .
There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix , or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment .
The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage .
During the early stages of analgesic treatment , the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible , but after prolonged analgesic treatment , maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover .
This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to <START:Disease> RPN <END> .
The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla .
Attenuation of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> in mice by <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> pretreatment .
Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> dopaminergic terminal damage <END> .
In this study , we examined the roles of <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> , a pro - inflammatory and inflammatory factor , treatment in modulating the <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced nigrostriatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lipopolysaccharide <END> pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - elicited <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> three days later .
Such systemic <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> treatment mitigated <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced striatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid <END> depletions in a dose - dependent manner .
As the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg ) of <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> was administered two weeks , one day before or after the <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> dosing regimen , <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced striatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid <END> depletions remained unaltered .
Moreover , systemic <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> pretreatment ( 1 mg / kg ) attenuated local <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> infusion - produced <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid <END> depletions in the striatum , indicating that the protective effect of <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> .
We concluded a critical time window for systemic <START:Chemical> lipopolysaccharide <END> pretreatment in exerting effective protection against <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced nigrostriatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and resuscitation in <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - , <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> - , or <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> - infused rats .
We compared the systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> , and <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> in anesthetized rats .
We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics .
<START:Chemical> Bupivacaine <END> , <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> , or <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> was infused at a rate of 2 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . min ( - 1 ) while electrocardiogram , electroencephalogram , and arterial pressure were continuously monitored .
When <START:Disease> asystole <END> was recorded , drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun .
<START:Chemical> Epinephrine <END> 0 . 01 mg / kg was administered at 1 - min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied .
Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or = 100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min .
The cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> that produced <START:Disease> seizures <END> were similar and were larger than those of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
The cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> that produced <START:Disease> dysrhythmias <END> and <START:Disease> asystole <END> were smaller than the corresponding doses of <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> , but they were larger than those of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups .
However , a smaller dose of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> was required in the <START:Chemical> Ropivacaine <END> group than in the other groups .
We conclude that the systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> is intermediate between that of <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> when administered at the same rate and that <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> or <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Triamterene <END> <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> complicating <START:Chemical> dyazide <END> therapy .
A case of <START:Chemical> triamterene <END> <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> is reported in a man after 4 years of <START:Chemical> hydrochlorothiazide - triamterene <END> therapy for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
The stone passed spontaneously and was found to contain a <START:Chemical> triamterene <END> metabolite admixed with <START:Chemical> uric acid salts <END> .
Factors affecting <START:Chemical> triamterene <END> <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> are discussed and 2 previously reported cases are reviewed .
Rosaceiform <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> associated with topical <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> treatment .
We describe herein 3 patients who developed <START:Disease> rosacea <END> - like <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> <START:Disease> eruptions <END> while using 0 . 03 % or 0 . 1 % <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ointment for <START:Disease> facial dermatitis <END> .
Skin biopsy specimens showed <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis .
Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> or <START:Chemical> pimecrolimus <END> should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> , although many cases have not been reported .
DSMM XI study : dose definition for intravenous <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> / <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> myeloma <END> .
A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> and <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> multiple myeloma <END> ( <START:Disease> MM <END> ) .
Thirty patients were treated with three 21 - day cycles of <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> 1 . 3 mg / m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 plus <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> 40 mg on the day of <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> injection and the day after plus <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> at 900 , 1 , 200 , or 1 , 500 mg / m ( 2 ) on day 1 .
The maximum tolerated dose of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> was defined as 900 mg / m ( 2 ) .
At this dose level , 92 % of patients achieved at least a partial response .
The overall response rate [ complete response ( CR ) plus partial response ( PR ) ] across all dose levels was 77 % , with a 10 % CR rate .
No patient experienced progressive disease .
The most frequent adverse events were <START:Disease> hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities <END> as well as <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> .
The results suggest that <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> at 900 mg / m ( 2 ) and <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> MM <END> that warrants further investigation .
Kidney function and morphology after short - term combination therapy with <START:Chemical> cyclosporine A <END> , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> in the rat .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> SRL <END> ) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation .
These are <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> , but <START:Chemical> SRL <END> seems to act differently displaying only minor <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects , although this question is still open .
In a number of treatment protocols where <START:Chemical> SRL <END> was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effect were described .
The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function , including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either <START:Chemical> cyclosporine A <END> ( <START:Chemical> CsA <END> ) , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ) or <START:Chemical> SRL <END> as monotherapies or in different combinations .
METHODS : For a period of 2 weeks , <START:Chemical> CsA <END> 15 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) , <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) or <START:Chemical> SRL <END> 0 . 4 mg / kg / day ( given intraperitoneally ) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague - Dawley rats .
In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model , the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA ) .
The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> , subcapsular <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> and the number of basophilic tubules , plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> in the cortex stained with Sirius Red .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> CsA <END> , <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> and <START:Chemical> SRL <END> all significantly decreased the GFR .
A further deterioration was seen when <START:Chemical> CsA <END> was combined with either <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> or <START:Chemical> SRL <END> , whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> plus <START:Chemical> SRL <END> when compared with treatment with any of the single substances .
The morphological changes presented a similar pattern .
The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with <START:Chemical> CsA <END> plus <START:Chemical> SRL <END> ( P < 0 . 001 compared with controls ) and the analysis of the total grade of <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P < 0 . 02 ) .
The <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> plus <START:Chemical> SRL <END> combination showed only a marginally higher degree of <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> as compared with controls ( P = 0 . 05 ) .
CONCLUSION : This rat study demonstrated a synergistic <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> plus <START:Chemical> SRL <END> , whereas <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> plus <START:Chemical> SRL <END> was better tolerated .
Refractory <START:Disease> cardiogenic shock <END> and complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> after <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> SR and <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> treatment .
A case report .
A seventy - eight - year - old woman presented with complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> and refractory <START:Disease> hypotension <END> two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained - release <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> with concomitant use of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
The patient continued to remain <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> with complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> , even with multiple uses of intravenous <START:Chemical> atropine <END> as well as high doses of pressor agents such as <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> .
However , shortly after the use of intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> , the refractory <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> resolved .
Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable <START:Disease> non - small cell lung cancer <END> with <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> : a phase II trial .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> ( <START:Chemical> Taxol <END> ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different <START:Disease> tumor <END> types , notably <START:Disease> ovarian and breast carcinoma <END> .
Two phase II trials of 24 - hour <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> infusions in chemotherapy - naive patients with stage IIIB or IV <START:Disease> non - small cell lung cancer <END> ( <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> ) reported response rates of 21 % and 24 % .
<START:Disease> Leukopenia <END> was dose limiting : as many as 62 . 5 % of patients experienced grade 4 <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> .
We investigated the efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of a 3 - hour <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
The 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women ) had a median age of 59 years ( age range , 25 to 75 ) and a performance status of 0 through 2 .
Most patients ( 72 . 4 % ) had stage IV <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> 225 mg / m 2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication .
Of 50 patients evaluable for response , 12 ( 24 % ) had partial remission , 26 ( 52 % ) had no change , and 12 had disease progression ( 24 % ) .
Hematologic <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were mild : only one patient ( 2 % ) developed grade 3 or 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> , while 29 % had grade 1 or 2 .
Grade 1 or 2 <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> affected 56 % of patients while only one ( 2 % ) experienced severe <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> .
Similarly , grade 1 or 2 <START:Disease> myalgia <END> / <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> was observed in 63 . 2 % of patients , but only 14 . 3 % experienced grade 3 or 4 .
<START:Disease> Nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> were infrequent , with 14 % of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2 % experiencing grade 3 or 4 .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> is thus an active single agent in this patient population , with a 3 - hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 - hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Further phase II studies with <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> combined with other drugs active against <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> are indicated , and phase III studies comparing <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> : inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase .
<START:Chemical> Cyclosporin A <END> ( <START:Chemical> CsA <END> ; 50 mg / kg ) and <START:Chemical> Fujimycine <END> ( <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ; 5 mg / kg ) , but not the related <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> immunosuppressant <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) , caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate , degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium , and <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days .
The molecular mechanisms of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were investigated .
Cyclophilin A and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - binding protein , the main intracytoplasmic receptors for <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , respectively , were each detected in renal tissue extract .
In the kidney , high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , but not by <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> .
Finally , specific immunophilin - drug - calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , but not <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> .
These results suggest that the <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase .
Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of <START:Disease> injury to different regions of the kidney <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute experimental models of renal damage <END> to the proximal tubular , glomerular , and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of <START:Chemical> hexachloro - 1 : 3 - butadiene <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCBD <END> ) , <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> 2 - bromoethylamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> BEA <END> ) , respectively .
Several routine indicators of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase , and the molecular weight of <START:Disease> protein excretion <END> were determined on urine samples .
Tubular damage produced by <START:Chemical> HCBD <END> or <START:Chemical> BEA <END> was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from <START:Disease> glomerular damage <END> produced by <START:Chemical> PAN <END> .
The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in <START:Disease> protein excretion <END> , especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40 , 000 Da .
In contrast , <START:Disease> protein excretion <END> in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by <START:Disease> excretion of proteins <END> of a wide range of molecular weights .
Proximal tubular damage caused by <START:Chemical> HCBD <END> and papillary damage caused by <START:Chemical> BEA <END> were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity ) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes .
Alkaline phosphatase and <START:Chemical> glucose <END> were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage .
It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of <START:Disease> renal damage <END> .
<START:Disease> Angioedema <END> associated with <START:Chemical> droperidol <END> administration .
<START:Disease> Angioedema <END> , also known as <START:Disease> angioneurotic edema <END> or <START:Disease> Quincke ' s disease <END> , is a well - demarcated , localized <START:Disease> edema <END> involving the subcutaneous tissues that may cause <START:Disease> upper - airway obstruction <END> .
We report the case of a previously healthy 19 - year - old man with no known <START:Disease> drug allergies <END> in whom <START:Disease> angioedema <END> with significant <START:Disease> tongue swelling <END> and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single IV dose of <START:Chemical> droperidol <END> .
Severe <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:Disease> haemolytic anaemia <END> associated with <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> : a case report with fatal outcome .
Haematological adverse reactions associated with fatal outcome are rare during treatment with <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> .
A 30 - year old Caucasian man reported with <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> and <START:Disease> jaundice <END> after 3 - day administration of oral <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> for a suspect of <START:Disease> urinary tract infection <END> .
Clinical evaluations suggested an initial diagnosis of severe <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:Disease> haemolysis <END> .
The patient progressively developed <START:Disease> petechiae <END> and <START:Disease> purpura <END> on thorax and lower limbs .
Despite pharmacological and supportive interventions , laboratory parameters worsened and the patient died 17 hours after admission .
An accurate autopsy revealed most organs with diffuse petechial <START:Disease> haemorrhages <END> .
No signs of <START:Disease> bone marrow depression <END> were found .
No <START:Disease> thrombi <END> or signs of <START:Disease> microangiopathies <END> were observed in arterial vessels .
Blood and urine cultures did not show any bacterial growth .
This case report shows that <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> may precipitate life - threatening <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:Disease> haemolytic anaemia <END> , even in the early phases of treatment and without apparent previous exposures .
Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> .
PURPOSE : To map and identify the pattern , in vivo , of <START:Disease> axonal degeneration <END> in <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
<START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> .
A serious complication of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> is an <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> that impairs visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and color vision .
However , early on , when the toxic <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> is mild and partly reversible , the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss .
METHODS : Three subjects with a history of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> ( <START:Chemical> EMB <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> of short - , intermediate - , and long - term <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> were administered a full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity , color vision , contrast sensitivity , and fundus examination .
In addition , OCT ( OCT 3000 , Humphrey - Zeiss , Dublin , CA ) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) analysis protocol .
OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL .
RESULTS : The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT , n = 661 .
In all subjects with history of <START:Chemical> EMB <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> , there was a mean loss of 72 % nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient A , with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields , 58 % loss ; patient B , with intermediate <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> , 68 % loss ; patient C , with chronic <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> , 90 % loss ) , with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm .
There was a combined mean loss of 46 % of fibers from the superior , inferior , and nasal quadrants in the ( six ) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm ) .
In both sets ( four ) of eyes of the subjects with persistent <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> ( patients B and C ) , there was an average loss of 79 % of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant .
CONCLUSIONS : The OCT results in these patients with <START:Chemical> EMB <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers .
This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons ) within the papillo - macular bundle in toxic or hereditary <START:Disease> optic neuropathies <END> .
OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of <START:Disease> optic neuropathies <END> .
Additionally , in terms of management of <START:Chemical> EMB <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> , it is important to properly manage <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> dosing in patients with <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached .
Mediation of enhanced reflex vagal <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> by <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> via central <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> formation in dogs .
<START:Chemical> L - Dopa <END> ( 5 mg / kg i . v . ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with <START:Chemical> MK - 486 <END> ( 25 mg / kg i . v . ) in anesthetize <START:Chemical> MAO <END> - inhibited dogs .
In addition , reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> caused by injected <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> was significantly enhanced by <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> , <START:Chemical> DL - Threo - dihydroxyphenylserine <END> had no effect on blood pressure , heart rate or reflex responses to <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> .
<START:Chemical> FLA - 63 <END> , a <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - beta - oxidase inhibitor , did not have any effect on the <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> or reflex - enhancing effect of <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pimozide <END> did not affect the actions of <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes .
Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> .
However , <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> restored the <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> caused by <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate .
<START:Chemical> 5 - HTP <END> ( 5 mg / kg i . v . ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> to <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> .
It is concluded that <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> enhances reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> through central alpha - receptor stimulation .
Furthermore , the effects are mediated through <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> rather than <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> and do not require the carotid sinus baroreceptors .
Epidural blood flow during <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 1 <END> or <START:Chemical> trimethaphan <END> induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
To evaluate the effect of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 1 <END> ( <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> ) or <START:Chemical> trimethaphan <END> ( <START:Chemical> TMP <END> ) induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> on epidural blood flow ( EBF ) during spinal surgery , EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero - lateral interbody fusion under <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> anaesthesia .
An initial dose of 0 . 1 microgram . kg - 1 . min - 1 of <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> ( 15 patients ) , or 10 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 of <START:Chemical> TMP <END> ( 15 patients ) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) at about 60 mmHg .
The <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure .
After starting <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> or <START:Chemical> TMP <END> , MAP and rate pressure product ( RPP ) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values ( P < 0 . 01 ) , and the degree of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> due to <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation .
Heart rate ( HR ) did not change in either group .
EBFF did not change during <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> infusion whereas in the <START:Chemical> TMP <END> group , EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of <START:Chemical> TMP <END> ( preinfusion : 45 . 9 + / - 13 . 9 ml / 100 g / min .
30 min : 32 . 3 + / - 9 . 9 ml / 100 g / min ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
60 min : 30 + / - 7 . 5 ml / 100 g / min ( P < 0 . 05 )) .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> may be preferable to <START:Chemical> TMP <END> for <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> anaesthesia in spinal surgery because <START:Chemical> TMP <END> decreased EBF .
High - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> may do more harm for <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> .
Because of the National Acute <START:Disease> Spinal Cord Injury <END> Studies ( NASCIS ) , high - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> became the standard of care for the acute <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> .
In the NASCIS , there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> that high - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> may cause .
The dosage of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition .
We hypothesize that it may cause some <START:Disease> damage to the muscle <END> of <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> patients .
Further , <START:Chemical> steroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , instead of any protection that <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> offers to the <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> .
To our knowledge , this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> recommended by NASCIS may cause acute <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Simvastatin <END> - induced bilateral leg <START:Disease> compartment syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> myonecrosis <END> associated with <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> .
A 54 - year - old <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> male taking <START:Chemical> thyroxine <END> and <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> presented with bilateral leg <START:Disease> compartment syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> myonecrosis <END> .
Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery with the withdrawal of <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> .
It is likely that this complication will be seen more often with the increased worldwide use of this drug and its approval for all <START:Disease> arteriopathic <END> patients .
Effect of <START:Chemical> fucoidan <END> treatment on collagenase - induced <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> in rats .
Inflammatory cells are postulated to mediate some of the <START:Disease> brain damage <END> following <START:Disease> ischemic stroke <END> .
<START:Disease> Intracerebral hemorrhage <END> is associated with more <START:Disease> inflammation <END> than <START:Disease> ischemic stroke <END> .
We tested the sulfated polysaccharide <START:Chemical> fucoidan <END> , which has been reported to reduce inflammatory <START:Disease> brain damage <END> , in a rat model of <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> induced by injection of bacterial collagenase into the caudate nucleus .
Rats were treated with seven day intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> fucoidan <END> ( 30 micrograms h - 1 ) or vehicle .
The <START:Disease> hematoma <END> was assessed in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging .
Motor behavior , passive avoidance , and skilled forelimb function were tested repeatedly for six weeks .
<START:Chemical> Fucoidan <END> - treated rats exhibited evidence of <START:Disease> impaired blood clotting <END> and <START:Disease> hemodilution <END> , had larger <START:Disease> hematomas <END> , and tended to have less <START:Disease> inflammation <END> in the vicinity of the <START:Disease> hematoma <END> after three days .
They showed significantly more rapid improvement of motor function in the first week following <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> and better memory retention in the passive avoidance test .
Acute <START:Disease> white matter edema <END> and eventual <START:Disease> neuronal loss <END> in the striatum adjacent to the <START:Disease> hematoma <END> did not differ between the two groups .
Investigation of more specific anti - inflammatory agents and hemodiluting agents are warranted in <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> in perfusion - cultured human eyes .
PURPOSE : Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> corticosteroid glaucoma <END> in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility .
The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes .
METHODS : The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow , variable pressure perfusion culture system .
Paired eyes were perfused in serum - free media with or without 10 ( - 7 ) M <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> for 12 days .
Intraocular pressure was monitored daily .
After incubation , the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy , transmission and scanning electron microscopy , and scanning laser confocal microscopy .
RESULTS : A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> with an average pressure rise of 17 . 5 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg after 12 days of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> exposure .
The contralateral control eyes , which did not receive <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> , maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period .
The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal .
In contrast , the <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - treated <START:Disease> hypertensive eyes <END> had thickened trabecular beams , decreased intertrabecular spaces , thickened juxtacanalicular tissue , activated trabecular meshwork cells , and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material , especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm .
The <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes , although several subtle <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced morphologic changes were evident .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> treatment of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes led to the generation of <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> in approximately 30 % of the <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - treated eyes .
<START:Chemical> Steroid <END> treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for <START:Disease> corticosteroid glaucoma <END> and <START:Disease> open angle glaucoma <END> .
This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in <START:Disease> steroid glaucoma <END> and <START:Disease> primary open angle glaucoma <END> .
Recurrent <START:Disease> dysphonia <END> and <START:Chemical> acitretin <END> .
We report the case of a woman complaining of <START:Disease> dysphonia <END> while she was treated by <START:Chemical> acitretin <END> .
Her symptoms totally regressed after drug withdrawal and reappeared when <START:Chemical> acitretin <END> was reintroduced .
To our knowledge , this is the first case of <START:Chemical> acitretin <END> - induced <START:Disease> dysphonia <END> .
This effect may be related to the pharmacological effect of this drug on mucous membranes .
Time course of lipid peroxidation in <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
Reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> , with antioxidants significantly reducing the <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
The temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was examined in this study .
Rats were treated with a single IV injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> , ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> , 7 . 5 mg / kg ) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 17 , 27 , 41 ( N = 5 - 10 per group ) .
The kidneys were removed , flushed with ice cold TRIS buffer .
Kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogenates .
Tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as <START:Chemical> thiobarbituric acid <END> reactive substances .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> was evident at day 5 , peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27 .
Lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17 .
This study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the <START:Disease> proteinuric injury <END> in <START:Chemical> PAN <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Remifentanil <END> pretreatment reduces <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> 1 microg / kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after anesthesia induction with <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> .
DESIGN : This was a randomized , double - blind study .
SETTING : The study was conducted at a university hospital .
PATIENTS : Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double - blinded fashion with <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> 1 microg / kg or placebo .
Two minutes after <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> or placebo injection , <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> 0 . 3 mg / kg was given .
MEASUREMENTS : <START:Disease> Myoclonus <END> was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3 .
The grade of sedation ( none , mild , moderate , severe ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> pruritus <END> , and <START:Disease> apnea <END> were recorded after injection of both drugs .
MAIN RESULTS : The incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> was significantly lower in the <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> group ( 6 . 7 % ) than in the placebo group ( 70 % ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
None of the patients experienced sedation , <START:Disease> apnea <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , or <START:Disease> pruritus <END> after injection of both drugs .
In the placebo group , male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> administration .
CONCLUSION : Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> 1 microg / kg reduced <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> induction without side effects such as sedation , <START:Disease> apnea <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , or <START:Disease> pruritus <END> .
Men experience increased incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> than women after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> administration .
Circulating lysosomal enzymes and <START:Disease> acute hepatic necrosis <END> .
The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , N - acetylglucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> .
Acid protease ( cathepsin D ) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> after <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , whereas activities were increased equally in patients with <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> due to <START:Disease> viral hepatitis <END> whether or not they survived .
A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> aminotransferase , which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall .
Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs , and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition .
Behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> on <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - treated mice .
The effects of <START:Chemical> dizocilpine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ) , a noncompetitive <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptor antagonist , were studied on <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - related behaviors induced by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> treatments .
This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , or <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> , and its response after glutamatergic blockage .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered once every other day for 4 days , produced increases in <START:Disease> orofacial dyskinesia <END> , tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice , which are signs indicative of <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> also produced <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , which are signs suggestive of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) , administered 30 min before the observation test , prevented the vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
However , <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> injection produced a significant increase of <START:Disease> tremor <END> in <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - treated mice .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered 90 min before the test and followed by <START:Chemical> apomophine <END> injection ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) 5 min before the test , did not produce <START:Disease> oral dyskinesia <END> in mice .
On the other hand , <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> induced increases in <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> compared to control mice .
<START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) administration attenuated the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and <START:Disease> tremor <END> induced by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion , as well as increases in <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , whereas <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
These results show that <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> produces different and <START:Disease> abnormal movements <END> , which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> - like and <START:Disease> tardive dsykinesia <END> signs .
The glutamatergic blockage produced by <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> can restore these signs , such as vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions , <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and <START:Disease> tremor <END> according to the employed model .
<START:Disease> Neuromuscular blockade <END> with <START:Chemical> magnesium sulfate <END> and <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> .
A patient who received tocolysis with <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> developed <START:Disease> neuromuscular blockade <END> after 500 mg of <START:Chemical> magnesium sulfate <END> was administered .
This reaction demonstrates that <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> can seriously potentiate the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> .
Caution should be exercised when these two tocolytics are combined .
<START:Chemical> Selegiline <END> - induced <START:Disease> postural hypotension <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> : a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal .
OBJECTIVES : The United Kingdom <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s Disease <END> Research Group ( UKPDRG ) trial found an increased mortality in patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) randomized to receive 10 mg <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> per day and <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> compared with those taking <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> alone .
Recently , we found that therapy with <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> and <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> was associated with selective <START:Disease> systolic orthostatic hypotension <END> which was abolished by withdrawal of <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> .
This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure .
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> .
METHODS : The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in <START:Disease> PD <END> patients receiving <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> and as the drug was withdrawn .
RESULTS : Head - up tilt caused <START:Disease> systolic orthostatic hypotension <END> which was marked in six of 20 <START:Disease> PD <END> patients on <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> , one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures .
A lesser degree of <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> occurred with standing .
<START:Disease> Orthostatic hypotension <END> was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug .
Stopping <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> also significantly <START:Disease> reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures <END> consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action .
CONCLUSION : This study confirms our previous finding that <START:Chemical> selegiline <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> is associated with selective <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> .
The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non - selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> and <START:Chemical> metamphetamine <END> are discussed .
Worsening of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> by motor and mental tasks .
Ten patients who had <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> with disabling <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation ) and motor ( flexion / extension of right fingers , flexion / extension of left fingers , flexion / extension of the neck , speaking aloud ) tasks on the worsening of peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> following administration of an effective single dose of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> .
Compared with the score at rest ( 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 ) , a significant aggravation of the <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> score was observed during speaking aloud ( 5 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 , p < 0 . 05 ) , movements of right ( 4 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) and left ( 3 . 7 + / - 0 . 8 , p < 0 . 05 ) fingers , movements of the neck ( 5 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) , and mental calculation ( 3 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) .
These results suggest that activation tasks such as " speaking aloud " could be used for objective assessment of <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> severity .
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
In a placebo - controlled , single - blinded , crossover study , we assessed the effect of " real " repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) versus " sham " rTMS ( placebo ) on peak dose <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) .
Ten patients with <START:Disease> PD <END> and prominent <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> had rTMS ( 1 , 800 pulses ; 1 Hz rate ) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice , once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used ; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series .
Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician - assessed <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> severity .
However , comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> severity following real rTMS but not placebo .
The major effect was on <START:Disease> dystonia <END> subscore .
Similarly , in patient diaries , although both treatments caused reduction in subjective <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> scores during the days of intervention , the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only .
Following rTMS , no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and <START:Disease> PD <END> symptoms were noted .
The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low - frequency rTMS on <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> PD <END> .
The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> is not essential for the development of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
It is widely believed that <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) mediates <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> to brain dopaminergic neurons , because drugs that interfere with <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurotransmission decrease <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , whereas drugs that increase <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurotransmission enhance <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
However , temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data .
Here we show that the recently reported ability of <START:Chemical> L - dihydroxyphenylalanine <END> to reverse the protective effect of <START:Chemical> alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine <END> on <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Chemical> DA <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature .
Further , we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain <START:Chemical> DA <END> develop <START:Chemical> METH <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> , as long as the thermic effects of <START:Chemical> METH <END> are preserved .
In addition , we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain <START:Chemical> DA <END> deficits develop <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> dopaminergic deficits <END> that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain .
Taken together , these findings demonstrate that <START:Chemical> DA <END> is not essential for the development of <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced dopaminergic <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> and suggest that mechanisms independent of <START:Chemical> DA <END> warrant more intense investigation .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> mood disorder <END> : prevalence rates and <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> symptoms in an outpatient <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - dependent sample .
This paper attempts to examine and compare prevalence rates and symptom patterns of DSM substance - induced and other <START:Disease> mood disorders <END> .
243 <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - dependent outpatients with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> mood disorder <END> ( <START:Disease> CIMD <END> ) , other <START:Disease> mood disorders <END> , or no <START:Disease> mood disorder <END> were compared on measures of <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> symptoms .
The prevalence rate for <START:Disease> CIMD <END> was 12 % at baseline .
Introduction of the DSM - IV diagnosis of <START:Disease> CIMD <END> did not substantially affect rates of the other <START:Disease> depressive disorders <END> .
Patients with <START:Disease> CIMD <END> had symptom severity levels between those of patients with and without a <START:Disease> mood disorder <END> .
These findings suggest some validity for the new DSM - IV diagnosis of <START:Disease> CIMD <END> , but also suggest that it requires further specification and replication .
<START:Disease> Renal papillary necrosis <END> due to <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> .
A 31 - year - old man with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , who had previously been treated with <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> , <START:Chemical> fenoprofen calcium <END> , high dose <START:Chemical> salicylates <END> and <START:Chemical> gold <END> salts , developed <START:Disease> renal papillary necrosis <END> ( <START:Disease> RPN <END> ) 4 months after institution of <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> therapy .
No other factor predisposing to <START:Disease> RPN <END> could be discovered .
<START:Chemical> Sulindac <END> was substituted for <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months .
We review previous reports linking <START:Disease> RPN <END> to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> in patients who have experienced <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> from other antiinflammatory agents .
<START:Chemical> All - trans - retinoic acid <END> - induced <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> in patients with <START:Disease> acute promyelocytic leukemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Erythema nodosum <END> associated with <START:Chemical> all - trans - retinoic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> ) for <START:Disease> acute promyelocytic leukemia <END> ( <START:Disease> APL <END> ) is very rare .
We describe four patients with classic <START:Disease> APL <END> who developed <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> during <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Fever <END> and subsequent multiple <START:Disease> painful <END> <START:Disease> erythematous nodules <END> over extremities developed on D 11 , D 16 , D 17 , and D 19 , respectively , after <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> therapy .
The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> .
All patients received short course of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
<START:Disease> Fever <END> subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely .
All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> .
<START:Chemical> ATRA <END> seemed to be the most possible etiology of <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> in our patients .
Short - term use of <START:Chemical> steroid <END> is very effective in <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> - induced <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> induced by <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> on the second day of treatment .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NMS <END> ) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
We describe a case of <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NMS <END> ) associated with the use of <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> .
Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with <START:Disease> NMS <END> , atypical antipsychotic drugs like <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> may also be a cause .
The patient is a 24 - year - old male with a history of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> who developed signs and symptoms of <START:Disease> NMS <END> after 2 days of treatment with an 80 - mg / day dose of orally administrated <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> .
This case is the earliest ( second day of treatment ) <START:Disease> NMS <END> due to <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> reported in the literature .
<START:Chemical> Caffeine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmia <END> : an unrecognised danger of healthfood products .
We describe a 25 - year - old woman with pre - existing <START:Disease> mitral valve prolapse <END> who developed intractable <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> after consuming a " natural energy " guarana health drink containing a high concentration of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> .
This case highlights the need for adequate labelling and regulation of such products .
The alpha 3 and beta 4 nicotinic <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor subunits are necessary for <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> hypolocomotion <END> in mice .
Binding of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> to nicotinic <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptors ( nAChRs ) elicits a series of dose - dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration , sedation , and <START:Disease> tremors <END> , to <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> death <END> .
nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits .
A gene cluster comprises the alpha 3 , alpha 5 and beta 4 subunits , which coassemble to form functional receptors .
We examined the role of the beta 4 subunits in <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> hypolocomotion <END> in beta 4 homozygous null ( beta 4 - / - ) and alpha 3 heterozygous ( + / - ) mice .
beta 4 - / - mice were less sensitive to the effects of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> both at low doses , measured as decreased exploration in an open field , and at high doses , measured as sensitivity to <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha 3 and alpha 5 subunits , we showed that alpha 5 mRNA levels are unchanged , whereas alpha 3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb , and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta 4 - / - brains .
alpha 3 + / - mice were partially resistant to <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> when compared to wild - type littermates .
mRNA levels for the alpha 5 and the beta 4 subunits were unchanged in alpha 3 + / - brains .
Together , these results suggest that the beta 4 and the alpha 3 subunits are mediators of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> hypolocomotion <END> .
Sub - chronic low dose <START:Chemical> gamma - vinyl GABA <END> ( <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> ) inhibits <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced increases in nucleus accumbens <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> .
RATIONALE : <START:Chemical> gamma - Vinyl GABA <END> ( <START:Chemical> GVG <END> ) irreversibly inhibits <START:Chemical> GABA <END> - transaminase .
This non - receptor mediated inhibition requires de novo synthesis for restoration of functional <START:Chemical> GABA <END> catabolism .
OBJECTIVES : Given its preclinical success for treating <START:Disease> substance abuse <END> and the increased risk of <START:Disease> visual field defects <END> ( <START:Disease> VFD <END> ) associated with cumulative lifetime exposure , we explored the effects of sub - chronic low dose <START:Chemical> GVG <END> on <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced increases in nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) .
METHODS : Using in vivo microdialysis , we compared acute exposure ( 450 mg / kg ) to an identical sub - chronic exposure ( 150 mg / kg per day for 3 days ) , followed by 1 - or 3 - day washout .
Finally , we examined the low dose of 150 mg / kg ( 50 mg / kg per day ) using a similar washout period .
RESULTS : Sub - chronic <START:Chemical> GVG <END> exposure inhibited the effect of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> for 3 days , which exceeded in magnitude and duration the identical acute dose .
CONCLUSIONS : Sub - chronic low dose <START:Chemical> GVG <END> potentiates and extends the inhibition of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced increases in <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> , effectively reducing cumulative exposures and the risk for VFDS .
<START:Disease> Leg and back pain <END> after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
Fifty - four patients , aged 27 - 90 years , who were given <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> 5 % in 6 . 8 % <START:Chemical> glucose <END> solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied .
Thirteen of these patients experienced <START:Disease> pain in the legs and / or back <END> after recovery from anaesthesia .
The patients affected were younger ( p < 0 . 05 ) and the site of the dural puncture was higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) than those individuals without <START:Disease> pain <END> .
Five of the 13 patients ( 38 % ) with <START:Disease> pain <END> and seven of the 41 patients ( 17 % ) without <START:Disease> pain <END> admitted to a high <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> intake , which might be a contributing factor .
<START:Disease> Leg and / or back pain <END> is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
Iatrogenic risks of <START:Disease> endometrial carcinoma <END> after treatment for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> in a large French case - control study .
F d ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer ( FNCLCC ) .
Since <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> is widely used in <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined .
We have investigated the association between <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> and <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use or other treatments in women treated for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> in a case - control study .
Cases of <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> diagnosed after <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> ( n = 135 ) and 467 controls matched for age , year of diagnosis of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included .
Women who had received <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> were significantly more likely to have <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> diagnosed than those who had not ( crude relative risk = 4 . 9 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment ( p = 0 . 0001 ) or the cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> received ( p = 0 . 0001 ) , irrespective of the daily dose .
Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk ( crude relative risk = 7 . 8 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
After adjusting for confounding factors , the risk was higher for <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> users ( p = 0 . 0012 ) , treatment for more than 3 years ( all p < 0 . 03 ) and pelvic radiotherapy ( p = 0 . 012 ) .
Women who had <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> and had received <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> had more <START:Disease> advanced disease <END> and poorer prognosis than those with <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> who had not received this treatment .
Our results suggest a causal role of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> in <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> , particularly when used as currently proposed for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> prevention .
Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
<START:Disease> Endometrial cancers <END> diagnosed in women treated with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> have poorer prognosis .
Women who receive <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment .
A long - term evaluation of the risk - benefit ratio of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> as a preventive treatment for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> is clearly warranted .
<START:Disease> Cardiovascular alterations <END> in rat fetuses exposed to <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers .
Preclinical toxicologic investigation suggested that a new <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker , <START:Chemical> Ro 40 - 5967 <END> , induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular alterations <END> in rat fetuses exposed to this agent during organogenesis .
The present study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers in general induce <START:Disease> cardiovascular malformations <END> indicating a pharmacologic class effect .
We studied three <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers of different structure , <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> , <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> , along with the new agent .
Pregnant rats were administered one of these <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers during the period of cardiac morphogenesis and the offspring examined on day 20 of gestation for <START:Disease> cardiovascular malformations <END> .
A low incidence of <START:Disease> cardiovascular malformations <END> was observed after exposure to each of the four <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers , but this incidence was statistically significant only for <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> and <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> .
All four agents were associated with aortic arch branching variants , although significantly increased only for <START:Chemical> Ro 40 - 5967 <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> .
Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout ( VIP - / - ) mice with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CYP <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways .
VIP ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CYP <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
Given VIP ' s role as an anti - inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that VIP ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT 2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( WT ) and VIP ( - / - ) mice with or without <START:Chemical> CYP <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> ( 150 mg / kg ; i . p . ; 48 h ) .
Four binary comparisons were made : WT control versus <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) , VIP ( - / - ) control versus <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) , WT control versus VIP ( - / - ) control , and WT with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) versus VIP ( - / - ) with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) .
The genes presented represent ( 1 ) greater than 1 . 5 - fold change in either direction and ( 2 ) the p value is less than 0 . 05 for the comparison being made .
Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme - linked immunoassays including IL - 1 beta and CXCL 1 .
<START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) increased expression of CXCL 1 and IL - 1 beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP ( - / - ) mice , but expression in VIP ( - / - ) mice with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment was significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) greater ( 4 . 2 - to 13 - fold increase ) than that observed in WT urinary bladder ( 3 . 6 - to 5 - fold increase ) .
The data suggest that in VIP ( - / - ) mice with <START:Disease> bladder inflammation <END> , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> .
This shift in balance may contribute to increased <START:Disease> bladder dysfunction <END> in VIP ( - / - ) mice with <START:Disease> bladder inflammation <END> and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways .
Conversion to <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients : report of an initial experience .
BACKGROUND : The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> conversion in patients undergoing <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CsA <END> ) or <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> Tac <END> ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
METHODS : Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> ) ( 5 mg / day ) 0 to 204 months posttransplant .
Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses .
The indications for switch were chronic <START:Chemical> CsA <END> or <START:Chemical> Tac <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 12 ) , acute <START:Chemical> CsA <END> or <START:Chemical> Tac <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ( 3 ) , severe <START:Disease> facial dysmorphism <END> ( 2 ) , <START:Disease> posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder <END> ( <START:Disease> PTLD <END> ) in remission ( 2 ) , and <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in 1 . Follow - up is 7 to 24 months .
RESULTS : In the 12 patients switched because of chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> there was a significant decrease in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> [ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 6 months ] .
<START:Disease> Facial dysmorphism <END> improved in two patients .
No relapse of <START:Disease> PTLD <END> was observed .
Five patients developed <START:Disease> pneumonia <END> ( two <START:Disease> Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia <END> , one <START:Disease> infectious mononucleosis <END> with polyclonal <START:Disease> PTLD <END> lung infiltrate ) and two had <START:Disease> bronchiolitis obliterans <END> .
There were no deaths .
<START:Chemical> RAPA <END> was discontinued in four patients , because of <START:Disease> pneumonia <END> in two , <START:Disease> PTLD <END> in one , and oral <START:Disease> aphtous ulcers <END> in one .
<START:Chemical> RAPA <END> levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml ) in 7 of 13 ( 54 % ) patients .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable <START:Chemical> CsA <END> withdrawal .
However , when converting patients to <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> drug levels should be monitored to avoid over - immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and <START:Disease> Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia <END> prophylaxis should be given .
<START:Disease> Syncope <END> and <START:Disease> QT prolongation <END> among patients treated with <START:Chemical> methadone <END> for <START:Chemical> heroin <END> dependence in the city of Copenhagen .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Methadone <END> is prescribed to <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts to decrease illicit opioid use .
Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> ( <START:Disease> TdP <END> ) has been reported in <START:Chemical> methadone <END> users .
As <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs , doctors might attribute too many episodes of <START:Disease> syncope <END> to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of <START:Disease> TdP <END> in this special population , and the high mortality in this population may , in part , be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of <START:Chemical> methadone <END> .
METHODS : In this cross - sectional study interview , ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts treated with <START:Chemical> methadone <END> or <START:Chemical> buprenorphine <END> on a daily basis .
Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen , 450 ( approximately 52 % ) were included .
The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs .
All participants were interviewed about any experience of <START:Disease> syncope <END> .
The association between opioid dose and QT , and <START:Chemical> methadone <END> dose and reporting of <START:Disease> syncope <END> was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression , respectively .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Methadone <END> dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0 . 140 ms / mg ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
No association between <START:Chemical> buprenorphine <END> and QTc was found .
Among the subjects treated with <START:Chemical> methadone <END> , 28 % men and 32 % women had <START:Disease> prolonged QTc interval <END> .
None of the subjects treated with <START:Chemical> buprenorphine <END> had QTc interval > 0 . 440 s (( 1 / 2 )) .
A 50 mg higher <START:Chemical> methadone <END> dose was associated with a 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 ) times higher odds for <START:Disease> syncope <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Methadone <END> is associated with <START:Disease> QT prolongation <END> and higher reporting of <START:Disease> syncope <END> in a population of <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts .
<START:Chemical> Prednisolone <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle dysfunction <END> is caused more by <START:Disease> atrophy <END> than by altered <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor expression .
Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood .
We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> on muscle function and pharmacology , and their relationship to changes in muscle size and <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor ( AChR ) expression .
With institutional approval , 35 Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg / kg <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> ( P 10 group ) , 100 mg / kg <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> ( P 100 group ) , or an equal volume of saline ( S group ) for 7 days .
A fourth group of rats was pair fed ( food restricted ) with the P 100 rats for 7 days ( FR group ) .
On Day 8 , the nerve - evoked peak twitch tensions , <START:Disease> tetanic <END> tensions , and fatigability , and the dose - response curves of <START:Chemical> d - tubocurarine <END> in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs .
Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P 100 , FR , and P 10 groups compared with the S group .
Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P 100 group than in the P 10 or S groups .
The evoked peak twitch and <START:Disease> tetanic <END> tensions were less in the P 100 group than in the P 10 or S groups , however , tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P 100 group than in the S group .
The 50 % effective dose of <START:Chemical> d - tubocurarine <END> ( microg / kg ) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P 10 ( 33 . 6 + / - 5 . 4 ) than in the S ( 61 . 9 + / - 5 . 0 ) or the P 100 ( 71 . 3 + / - 9 . 6 ) groups .
AChR expression was less in the P 10 group than in the S group .
The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 32 , P < 0 . 001 ) , however , not with expression of AChR .
The 50 % effective dose of <START:Chemical> d - tubocurarine <END> did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression .
Our results suggest that the <START:Disease> neuromuscular dysfunction <END> after <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> is dose - dependent , and derives primarily from <START:Disease> muscle atrophy <END> and derives less so from changes in AChR expression .
IMPLICATIONS : The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear .
We suggest that the observed effects are dose - dependent and derive primarily from <START:Disease> muscle atrophy <END> and derive less from changes in <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor expression .
<START:Disease> Cauda equina syndrome <END> after epidural <START:Chemical> steroid <END> injection : a case report .
OBJECTIVE : Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral <START:Disease> radiculopathy <END> are physical therapy , epidural <START:Chemical> steroid <END> injections , oral medications , and spinal manipulative therapy .
<START:Disease> Cauda equina syndrome <END> is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia .
The following case is a report of <START:Disease> cauda equina syndrome <END> possibly caused by epidural injection of <START:Chemical> triamcinolone <END> and <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
CLINICAL FEATURES : A 50 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> low back and right leg pain <END> was scheduled for epidural <START:Chemical> steroid <END> injection .
INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME : An 18 - gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L 4 - 5 level .
Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging .
After verifying the epidural space , <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> triamcinolone diacetate <END> were injected .
After the injection , there was a reduction in radicular symptoms .
Three hours later , she complained of perineal <START:Disease> numbness <END> and <START:Disease> lower extremity weakness <END> .
The neurologic evaluation revealed <START:Disease> loss of sensation <END> in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg .
There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test .
Deep - tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg .
She was unable to urinate .
The patient ' s symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours .
She had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling Foley catheter .
All of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hours .
CONCLUSION : Complications associated with epidural <START:Chemical> steroid <END> injections are rare .
Clinical examination and continued vigilance for <START:Disease> neurologic deterioration <END> after epidural <START:Chemical> steroid <END> injections is important .
Effects of <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> on the isolated perfused rat kidney .
Although <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> has been associated with the development of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains unclear .
The direct <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects of a single dose of 15 mg of <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell - free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg / dL of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> .
There were no significant differences in renal <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion , <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> compared with the drug - free control groups .
In contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> to the kidney perfused with <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> ; no changes were found with <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> in the absence of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> .
A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> was found in rats given <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> , compared with drug - free controls .
However , the fractional excretion of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period .
In summary , <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> causes <START:Disease> acute declines in renal function <END> , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> on pre - existing and <START:Chemical> aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> is a side effect of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> treatment in <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> patients .
The possibility of reproducing the same <START:Disease> renal abnormality <END> with <START:Chemical> captopril <END> was examined in SHR .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> at 100 mg / kg for 14 days failed to aggravate <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> pre - existing in SHR .
Also , <START:Chemical> captopril <END> treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> invoked by <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> in SHR .
<START:Chemical> Captopril <END> had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations , excretion of urine , <START:Chemical> sodium <END> and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> , endogenous <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance , body weight , and food and water consumption .
However , <START:Chemical> ketone <END> bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> in SHR .
Synthesis of <START:Chemical> N - pyrimidinyl - 2 - phenoxyacetamides <END> as <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonists .
A series of <START:Chemical> N - pyrimidinyl - 2 - phenoxyacetamide <END> <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A ( 2 A ) antagonists is described .
SAR studies led to compound 14 with excellent potency ( K ( i ) = 0 . 4 nM ) , selectivity ( A ( 1 ) / A ( 2 A ) > 100 ) , and efficacy ( MED 10 mg / kg p . o . ) in the rat <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> model for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Disease> Withdrawal - emergent rabbit syndrome <END> during dose reduction of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
<START:Disease> Rabbit syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> RS <END> ) is a rare extrapyramidal side effect caused by prolonged neuroleptic medication .
Here we present a case of <START:Disease> withdrawal - emergent RS <END> , which is the first of its kind to be reported .
The patient developed <START:Disease> RS <END> during dose reduction of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
The symptom was treated successfully with <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> anticholinergic therapy .
The underlying mechanism of <START:Disease> withdrawal - emergent RS <END> in the present case may have been related to the pharmacological profile of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> , a <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> - <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> antagonist , suggesting the pathophysiologic influence of the <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> system in the development of <START:Disease> RS <END> .
<START:Disease> Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria <END> in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in mice : suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression .
The use of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ) in <START:Disease> cancer <END> chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicity <END> .
Earlier observations that <START:Chemical> ADR <END> interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i . p . treated with <START:Chemical> ADR <END> for several weeks .
At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy .
In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes .
Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies .
Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with <START:Chemical> ADR <END> caused <START:Disease> cardiovascular arrhythmias <END> characterized by <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent <START:Disease> swelling <END> , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment .
Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined , only COXII gene expression was suppressed by <START:Chemical> ADR <END> treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver .
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of <START:Chemical> ADR <END> on cardiovascular function involve <START:Disease> mitochondrial structural and functional impairment <END> .
A selective <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 4 receptor antagonist , <START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> : a preclinical neuropharmacological profile .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - [ 2 - ( 4 - ( 3 - fluorobenzylidene ) piperidin - 1 - yl ) ethyl ] - 4 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) thiazole - 2 - carboxamide <END> , has a high affinity for human cloned <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 4 . 2 , D 4 . 4 and D 4 . 7 receptors , with Ki values of 0 . 5 , 0 . 9 and 2 . 7 nM , respectively .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> is over 20 , 000 fold more potent at the <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 4 . 2 receptor compared with the human cloned <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 L receptor .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> has negligible affinity for the human cloned <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 3 receptor ( Ki = 39 nM ) , rat <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ) 2 A receptors ( Ki = 180 nM ) and rat alpha 1 adrenoceptor ( Ki = 237 nM ) .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> and <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> antagonized locomotor <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MAP <END> ) in mice .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> and <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> antagonized <START:Chemical> MAP <END> - induced stereotyped behavior in mice , although their effects did not exceed 50 % inhibition , even at the highest dose given .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> and <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> significantly induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats , although their effects did not exceed 50 % induction even at the highest dose given .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> and <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> significantly reversed the disruption of prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in rats produced by <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> .
<START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> and <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> significantly shortened the <START:Chemical> phencyclidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PCP <END> ) - induced prolonged swimming latency in rats in a water maze task .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> NRA 0160 <END> may have unique antipsychotic activities without the liability of motor side effects typical of classical antipsychotics .
<START:Chemical> Cefotetan <END> - induced immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
Immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> due to a drug - adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving <START:Chemical> penicillins <END> and first - generation <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> .
We describe a patient who developed <START:Disease> anemia <END> while receiving intravenous <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cefotetan <END> - dependent antibodies were detected in the patient ' s serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells .
The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> , suggesting the concomitant formation of warm - reactive autoantibodies .
These observations , in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> , are consistent with drug - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , possibly involving both drug - adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms .
This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> .
Intracavernous <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> : a minimally invasive treatment for <START:Disease> priapism <END> in the emergency department .
<START:Disease> Priapism <END> is the prolonged erection of the penis in the absence of sexual arousal .
A 45 - year - old man , an admitted frequent <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> user , presented to the Emergency Department ( ED ) on two separate occasions with a history of <START:Disease> priapism <END> after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
The management options in the ED , as exemplified by four individual case reports , in particular the use of a minimally invasive method of intracorporal <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> instillation , are discussed .
<START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> transport in humans with <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
A deficient <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> - <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> system is implicated in <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
We investigate whether abnormalities in <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> uptake contribute to this deficiency .
Eight healthy men were recruited .
<START:Chemical> Hydrocortisone acetate <END> ( 50 mg ) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5 - day fixed - salt diet ( 150 mmol / d ) .
Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart .
Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period .
<START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> ( 1 to 300 micromol / L ) , incorporating 100 nmol / L <START:Chemical> [ 3 H ] - l - arginine <END> for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C .
Forearm <START:Chemical> [ 3 H ] - L - arginine <END> extraction was calculated after infusion of <START:Chemical> [ 3 H ] - L - arginine <END> into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi / min for 80 minutes .
Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> extraction .
Plasma <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase ( 323 + / - 43 to 1082 + / - 245 mmol / L , P < 0 . 05 ) .
Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg .
Neither <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> transport into mononuclear cells ( placebo vs active , 26 . 3 + / - 3 . 6 vs 29 . 0 + / - 2 . 1 pmol / 10 000 cells per 5 minutes , respectively , at an <START:Chemical> l - arginine <END> concentration of 300 micromol / L ) nor <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> extraction in the forearm ( at 80 minutes , placebo vs active , 1 868 904 + / - 434 962 vs 2 013 910 + / - 770 619 disintegrations per minute ) was affected by <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> treatment ; ie , that <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> uptake is not affected by short - term <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> treatment .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> - induced <START:Disease> increases in blood pressure <END> are not associated with abnormalities in the <START:Chemical> l - arginine <END> transport system .
The hemodynamics of <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cases .
<START:Chemical> Oxytocin <END> is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , particularly when given as a bolus .
The resulting <START:Disease> hypotension <END> can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return .
Parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this <START:Disease> hypotension <END> with a compensatory increase in heart rate and <START:Disease> stroke <END> volume .
<START:Chemical> Oxytocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to <START:Disease> blood loss <END> .
Pulse power analysis ( also called " pulse contour analysis " ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure .
Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> in response to <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in <START:Disease> stroke <END> volume , heart rate and cardiac output .
Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating <START:Disease> hypotension <END> during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia .
<START:Chemical> Clotiazepam <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
We report the case of a patient who developed acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> with <START:Disease> extensive hepatocellular necrosis <END> , 7 months after the onset of administration of <START:Chemical> clotiazepam <END> , a <START:Chemical> thienodiazepine <END> derivative .
<START:Chemical> Clotiazepam <END> withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery .
The administration of several <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> , chemically related to <START:Chemical> clotiazepam <END> , did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
This observation shows that <START:Chemical> clotiazepam <END> can induce acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> and suggests that there is no cross <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> between <START:Chemical> clotiazepam <END> and several <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> .
Case report : <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> and polymorphic <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> revisited .
<START:Chemical> Pentamidine isethionate <END> has been associated with <START:Disease> ventricular tachyarrhythmias <END> , including <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date .
<START:Chemical> Pentamidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> may be related to serum <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> levels and <START:Disease> hypomagnesemia <END> may synergistically induce torsade .
<START:Disease> Torsade de pointes <END> occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> .
In these patients , no other acute side effects of <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> were observed .
<START:Disease> Torsade de pointes <END> can be treated when recognized early , possibly without discontinuation of <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> .
When <START:Disease> QTc interval prolongation <END> is observed , early <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> supplementation is advocated .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced iliopsoas <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> with subsequent <START:Disease> femoral nerve palsy <END> .
We present the case of a 28 - year - old man on chronic <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> therapy who sustained a minor <START:Disease> muscle tear <END> and developed increasing <START:Disease> pain <END> and a flexure <START:Disease> contracture <END> of the right hip .
Surgical exploration revealed an iliopsoas <START:Disease> hematoma <END> and femoral <START:Disease> nerve entrapment <END> , resulting in a <START:Disease> femoral nerve palsy <END> and <START:Disease> partial loss of quadriceps functions <END> .
Anticoagulant - induced <START:Disease> femoral nerve palsy <END> represents the most common form of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> ; it is characterized by severe <START:Disease> pain <END> in the inguinal region , varying degrees of <START:Disease> motor and sensory impairment <END> , and flexure <START:Disease> contracture <END> of the involved extremity .
Rapid reversal of life - threatening <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> - induced <START:Disease> tetany <END> with <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> .
We describe a patient who developed <START:Disease> tetany <END> with sudden <START:Disease> respiratory arrest <END> after the infusion of intravenous <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> .
The administration of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> rapidly resolved the patient ' s <START:Disease> tetany <END> with prompt recovery of respiratory function , averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support .
The emergency physician should be aware that life - threatening <START:Disease> tetany <END> may accompany the administration of intravenous <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> and that <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> may be a rapid and effective remedy .
Acute <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> and subchronic <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> treatments change synaptosomal brain <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> uptake and elicit <START:Disease> orofacial dyskinesia <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> - and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> orofacial dyskinesia <END> are putative animal models of <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> ( <START:Disease> TD <END> ) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress .
In the present study , the authors induced <START:Disease> orofacial dyskinesia <END> by acute <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> and subchronic <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> administration to rats .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> injection ( one dose of 1 mg / kg s . c . ) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching , compared to the control .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> administration ( one dose of 12 mg / kg once a week s . c . ) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations .
After the treatments and behavioral observation , <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed .
A decreased <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , compared to the control .
Importantly , a decrease in <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of <START:Disease> orofacial diskinesia <END> .
These results indicate that early changes in <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> associated with <START:Disease> sleep deprivation <END> and sustained - release <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> .
This case report describes a generalized <START:Disease> seizure <END> associated with sustained - release <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> use and <START:Disease> sleep deprivation <END> .
The subject , a 31 - year - old female smoker , was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained - release <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> as an active control .
After 5 weeks of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> use , the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic <START:Disease> seizure <END> after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence .
The patient had no other risk factors for <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
We suggest that <START:Disease> sleep deprivation <END> may add to the risk of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> - associated <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Analgesic effect of intravenous <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> in <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients on <START:Chemical> morphine <END> therapy : a randomized , controlled , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> not responsive to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> is often problematic .
Animal and clinical studies have suggested that <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) antagonists , such as <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> , may be effective in improving opioid analgesia in difficult <START:Disease> pain <END> syndromes , such as <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> .
A slow bolus of subhypnotic doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> ( 0 . 25 mg / kg or 0 . 50 mg / kg ) was given to 10 <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients whose <START:Disease> pain <END> was unrelieved by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in a randomized , double - blind , crossover , double - dose study .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> intensity on a 0 to 10 numerical scale ; <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , drowsiness , <START:Disease> confusion <END> , and <START:Disease> dry mouth <END> , using a scale from 0 to 3 ( not at all , slight , a lot , awful ) ; Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) ( 0 - 30 ) ; and arterial pressure were recorded before administration of drugs ( T 0 ) and after 30 minutes ( T 30 ) , 60 minutes ( T 60 ) , 120 minutes ( T 120 ) , and 180 minutes ( T 180 ) .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> , but not saline solution , significantly reduced the <START:Disease> pain <END> intensity in almost all the patients at both doses .
This effect was more relevant in patients treated with higher doses .
<START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> occurred in 4 patients , and an unpleasant sensation ( " empty head " ) was also reported by 2 patients .
These episodes reversed after the administration of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> 1 mg intravenously .
Significant increases in drowsiness were reported in patients treated with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> in both groups and were more marked with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> 0 . 50 mg / kg .
A significant difference in MMSE was observed at T 30 in patients who received 0 . 50 mg / kg of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> can improve <START:Chemical> morphine <END> analgesia in difficult <START:Disease> pain <END> syndromes , such as <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> .
However , the occurrence of central adverse effects should be taken into account , especially when using higher doses .
This observation should be tested in studies of prolonged <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> administration .
Causes of acute <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> in patients receiving kidney transplantation .
OBJECTIVES : <START:Disease> Thrombotic microangiopathy <END> is a well - known problem in patients following renal transplantation .
In postrenal transplantation , <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> is often a reflection of <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> .
We aimed to determine the causes of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : We investigated the causes of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> during a 1 - year period , from June 2003 to June 2004 , at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this interval .
Pre - and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible .
RESULTS : Five cases of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> were found .
Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital , while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow - up .
Three cases were related to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> , and 1 case was secondary to both <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> .
The fifth case had features of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> related to an <START:Disease> antiphospholipid syndrome <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : In the literature , the most - frequent cause of <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> .
Other causes include drug - related ( <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , procoagulant status , and antibody - mediated rejection .
We found that the most - frequent cause of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> was drug related , secondary mainly to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> .
In the current study , the frequency of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> was similar to the percentage reported in the literature ( 20 % ) .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> responses in <START:Chemical> methadone <END> - maintained opioid abusers .
Providing <START:Disease> pain <END> management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task , in part because little is known about their <START:Disease> pain <END> experience and analgesic requirements .
This study was designed to describe <START:Disease> pain <END> tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of <START:Disease> opioid addicts <END> stabilized in <START:Chemical> methadone <END> - maintenance ( MM ) treatment ( n = 60 ) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) .
By using a placebo - controlled , two - way factorial design , tolerance to cold - pressor ( CP ) <START:Disease> pain <END> was examined , both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( <START:Chemical> hydromorphone <END> 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( <START:Chemical> ketorolac <END> 10 mg ) analgesic agents .
Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP <START:Disease> pain <END> than control subjects , replicating previous work .
Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group .
These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a <START:Disease> pain - intolerant <END> subset of clinical patients .
Their complaints of <START:Disease> pain <END> should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> - induced <START:Disease> sinoatrial block <END> .
We observed <START:Disease> sinoatrial block <END> due to chronic <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> administration in a 5 - year - old boy with <START:Disease> primary cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:Disease> Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> supraventricular tachycardia <END> .
Reduction in the dosage of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> resulted in the disappearance of the <START:Disease> sinoatrial block <END> and the persistence of asymptomatic <START:Disease> sinus bradycardia <END> .
<START:Disease> Hepatonecrosis <END> and <START:Disease> cholangitis <END> related to long - term <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> therapy : an autopsy report of two patients .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbital <END> ( <START:Chemical> PB <END> ) has a reputation for safety , and it is commonly believed that <START:Chemical> PB <END> - related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic <START:Disease> liver disease <END> .
Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> treated with <START:Chemical> PB <END> who died suddenly : one as consequence of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> , the other of acute <START:Disease> bronchopneumonia <END> .
At autopsy , analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate , which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells , associated with several foci of <START:Disease> necrosis <END> surrounded by a hard ring of non - specific granulomatous tissue .
Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen .
Our findings illustrate that <START:Chemical> PB <END> may be associated with chronic <START:Disease> liver damage <END> , which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences .
For this reason , each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of <START:Chemical> PB <END> - related asymptomatic <START:Disease> chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> mycophenolate mofetil <END> for calcineurin - free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
Calcineurin inhibitors , such as <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> , have been available for almost 20 years .
Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression , they are associated with acute and chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> may eventually result in graft loss .
Acute and chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases .
Two recently available immunosuppressive agents , <START:Chemical> mycophenolate mofetil <END> and <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ) , have no <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy .
This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
In vivo characterization of a dual <START:Chemical> adenosine A 2 A / A 1 receptor antagonist <END> in animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
The in vivo characterization of a dual <START:Chemical> adenosine A ( 2 A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist <END> in several animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> is described .
Discovery and scale - up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail , highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10 . 0 % to 30 . 5 % .
Compound 1 is a potent A ( 2 A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist in vitro ( A ( 2 A ) K ( i ) = 4 . 1 nM ; A ( 1 ) K ( i ) = 17 . 0 nM ) that has excellent activity , after oral administration , across a number of animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> including mouse and rat models of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , mouse model of <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> akinesia <END> , rat <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> ) lesion model of drug - induced rotation , and <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - treated non - human primate model .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> in a neonate .
The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> after therapy with <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ( 5 mg / kg / day ) and <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> are presented .
The serum <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> concentration had reached toxic levels when <START:Disease> anuria <END> developed .
Numerous <START:Chemical> periodic acid <END> Schiff ( PAS ) positive , diastase resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which appeared as myelin figures in cytosegresomes under the electron microscope were identified in the proximal convoluted tubules .
The pathological changes induced by <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> in the human neonatal kidneys have not been previously reported .
<START:Chemical> Carbamazepine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> .
Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes .
A patient with sinus <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and <START:Disease> atrioventricular block <END> , induced by <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> , prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases .
From the analysis of these cases , two distinct forms of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> - associated <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> emerged .
One patient group developed <START:Disease> sinus tachycardias <END> in the setting of a massive <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life - threatening <START:Disease> bradyarrhythmias <END> or <START:Disease> atrioventricular conduction delay <END> , associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> serum levels .
Because <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> conditions , the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients .
<START:Disease> Hemolysis <END> of human erythrocytes induced by <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> is related to disruption of membrane structure .
<START:Chemical> Tamoxifen <END> ( <START:Chemical> TAM <END> ) , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
This work evaluates the effects of <START:Chemical> TAM <END> on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on <START:Chemical> TAM <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms .
<START:Chemical> TAM <END> induces <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .
The extension of <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microM <START:Chemical> TAM <END> induces total <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> of all tested suspensions .
Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , <START:Chemical> TAM <END> does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .
The <START:Disease> hemolytic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> TAM <END> is prevented by low concentrations of <START:Chemical> alpha - tocopherol <END> ( <START:Chemical> alpha - T <END> ) and <START:Chemical> alpha - tocopherol acetate <END> ( <START:Chemical> alpha - TAc <END> ) ( inactivated functional <START:Chemical> hydroxyl <END> ) indicating that <START:Chemical> TAM <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> is not related to oxidative membrane damage .
This was further evidenced by absence of <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with <START:Chemical> TAM <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> .
Furthermore , it was observed that <START:Chemical> TAM <END> inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by <START:Chemical> AAPH <END> , thus ruling out <START:Chemical> TAM <END> - induced cell oxidative stress .
<START:Disease> Hemolysis <END> caused by <START:Chemical> TAM <END> was not preceded by the leakage of <START:Chemical> K <END> ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .
However , <START:Chemical> TAM <END> induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .
Either <START:Chemical> alpha - T <END> or <START:Chemical> alpha - TAc <END> increases membrane packing and prevents <START:Chemical> TAM <END> partition into model membranes .
These effects suggest that the protection from <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> by <START:Chemical> tocopherols <END> is related to a decreased <START:Chemical> TAM <END> incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided .
Therefore , <START:Chemical> TAM <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane .
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by <START:Chemical> TAM <END> , resulting in <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by <START:Chemical> TAM <END> may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action .
<START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> complicating bone marrow transplantation .
<START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> is a potentially serious complication of high - dose <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation .
As standard practice at our institution , patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation .
In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation , we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> , which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> that causes <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis , 4 had symptomatic <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
In contrast , two of four consecutive patients who received <START:Chemical> mesna <END> uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> for at least 2 weeks .
Because of this suboptimal result , we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
Does supplemental <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> increase <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> risk in women with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> ?
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> acts as a potent antioxidant ; however , it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro .
These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> in <START:Disease> diabetic <END> persons might promote <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> .
OBJECTIVE : The objective was to examine the relation between <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake and mortality from <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> .
DESIGN : We studied the relation between <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake and mortality from total <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> ( n = 281 ) , <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> ( n = 175 ) , and <START:Disease> stroke <END> ( n = 57 ) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being <START:Disease> diabetic <END> at baseline .
Diet was assessed with a food - frequency questionnaire at baseline , and subjects initially free of <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> were prospectively followed for 15 y .
RESULTS : After adjustment for <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> risk factors , type of <START:Disease> diabetes <END> medication used , duration of <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , and intakes of <START:Chemical> folate <END> , <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> , and <START:Chemical> beta - carotene <END> , the adjusted relative risks of total <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> mortality were 1 . 0 , 0 . 97 , 1 . 11 , 1 . 47 , and 1 . 84 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) across quintiles of total <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake from food and supplements .
Adjusted relative risks of <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> were 1 . 0 , 0 . 81 , 0 . 99 , 1 . 26 , and 1 . 91 ( P for trend = 0 . 01 ) and of <START:Disease> stroke <END> were 1 . 0 , 0 . 52 , 1 . 23 , 2 . 22 , and 2 . 57 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) .
When dietary and supplemental <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> were analyzed separately , only supplemental <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> showed a positive association with mortality endpoints .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> intake was unrelated to mortality from <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline .
CONCLUSION : A high <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> mortality in postmenopausal women with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> .
Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP 2 - deficient TR ( - ) rats resembles <START:Disease> seizure <END> - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats .
PURPOSE : The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP 2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) .
MRP 2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( - )) Wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP 2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP 2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats .
By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP 2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> is a substrate for MRP 2 in the BBB .
However , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur .
This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the BBB , in TR ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) Wistar rats .
METHODS : The expression of MRP 2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( - ) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel , highly selective monoclonal MRP 2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C 219 , respectively .
RESULTS : Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP 2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( - ) rats .
TR ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls .
No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections .
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in wild - type Wistar rats .
Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> and the selective Pgp inhibitor <START:Chemical> tariquidar <END> in TR ( - ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP 2 in the BBB .
CONCLUSIONS : The data on TR ( - ) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP 2 deficiency in the BBB .
Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce <START:Disease> injury to the brain <END> from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP 2 performs a protective role in the BBB .
Furthermore , our data suggest that TR ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing <START:Disease> seizures <END> or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose .
<START:Disease> Bradycardia <END> due to <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride <END> .
A chronic <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug , <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride <END> .
The patient developed , paradoxically , sinus <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
The reaction was specific to <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> and not to other anticholinergic drugs .
This antidyskinetic drug is widely used in clinical <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> practice and physicians should be aware of this side effect .
<START:Chemical> Disulfiram <END> - like syndrome after <START:Chemical> hydrogen cyanamide <END> professional skin exposure : two case reports in France .
<START:Chemical> Hydrogen cyanamide <END> is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees .
Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits <START:Chemical> aldehyde <END> dehydrogenase and can induce <START:Chemical> acetaldehyde <END> syndrome in case of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> use .
The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> - like syndrome following occupational exposure to <START:Chemical> hydrogen cyanamide <END> .
The first case involved a 59 - year - old man who used <START:Chemical> Dormex <END> , which contains <START:Chemical> hydrogen cyanamide <END> , without protection after consuming a large amount of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> during a meal .
In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> , he developed malaise with <START:Disease> flushing of the face <END> , <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> , and <START:Disease> dyspnea <END> .
Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital .
The second case occurred in a 55 - year - old farmer following cutaneous contact with <START:Chemical> Dormex <END> .
Five hours after exposure , he developed <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> - like syndrome with <START:Disease> flushing <END> , <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> , and <START:Disease> arterial hypotension <END> after consuming three glasses of wine .
The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital .
These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of <START:Chemical> Dormex <END> and of preventing cutaneous contact during use .
Prolonged <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> after <START:Chemical> troleandomycin <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
We report the case of a patient in whom <START:Chemical> troleandomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> was followed by prolonged anicteric <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> .
<START:Disease> Jaundice <END> occurred after administration of <START:Chemical> troleandomycin <END> for 7 days and was associated with <START:Disease> hypereosinophilia <END> .
<START:Disease> Jaundice <END> disappeared within 3 months but was followed by prolonged anicteric <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> marked by <START:Disease> pruritus <END> and high levels of alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities .
Finally , <START:Disease> pruritus <END> disappeared within 19 months , and liver tests returned to normal 27 months after the onset of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
This observation demonstrates that prolonged <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> can follow <START:Chemical> troleandomycin <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Delirium <END> during <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> treatment : incidence and associated risk factors .
BACKGROUND : Incidence and risk factors for <START:Disease> delirium <END> during <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> treatment require further clarification .
METHODS : We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> inpatients treated with <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> ( 1995 - 96 ) , reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of <START:Disease> delirium <END> , and tested associations with potential risk factors .
RESULTS : Subjects ( n = 139 ) were 72 women and 67 men , aged 40 . 8 + / - 12 . 1 years , hospitalized for 24 . 9 + / - 23 . 3 days , and given <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> , gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 + / - 203 mg ( 3 . 45 + / - 2 . 45 mg / kg ) for 18 . 9 + / - 16 . 4 days .
<START:Disease> Delirium <END> was diagnosed in 14 ( 10 . 1 % incidence , or 1 . 48 cases / person - years of exposure ) ; 71 . 4 % of cases were moderate or severe .
Associated factors were co - treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents , poor clinical outcome , older age , and longer hospitalization ( by 17 . 5 days , increasing cost ) ; sex , diagnosis or medical co - morbidity , and daily <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> dose , which fell with age , were unrelated .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Delirium <END> was found in 10 % of <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> - treated inpatients , particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics .
<START:Disease> Delirium <END> was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length - of - stay and higher costs , and inferior clinical outcome .
Reversal of central <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> effects by <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> after intravenous conscious sedation with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> and opioids : report of a double - blind multicenter study .
The <START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> in Intravenous Conscious Sedation with <START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> Multicenter Study Group II .
The efficacy and safety of a new <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> antagonist , <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> , were assessed in a double - blind multicenter study .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> ( mean dose , 0 . 76 mg ) or placebo ( mean dose , 8 . 9 ml ) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients , respectively , who had been given <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> in conjunction with an opioid ( <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> , <START:Chemical> meperidine <END> , or <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures .
The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> and 64 patients given placebo .
After 5 minutes , 80 / 115 ( 70 % ) <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> - treated patients , compared with 21 / 63 ( 33 % ) placebo - treated patients , were completely awake and alert , as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer ' s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale .
Ninety - five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5 - minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180 - minute assessment period .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> - treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger - to - Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5 - minute assessment .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> was well tolerated , with no serious adverse effects reported .
Thirty - nine ( 30 % ) of <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> - treated patients , compared with 17 ( 25 % ) of placebo - treated patients had one or more drug - related adverse experiences .
The most common adverse effects were <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> in the <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> group and <START:Disease> nausea <END> and injection - site <START:Disease> pain <END> in the placebo group .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> in the presence of opioids .
Reversible <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> with <START:Disease> bile duct injury <END> following <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> therapy .
A case report .
A 67 - year - old patient , with primary <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> and without previous evidence of <START:Disease> liver disease <END> , developed clinical and biochemical features of severe <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> 3 months after initiation of <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> therapy .
Liver biopsy showed <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts .
<START:Chemical> Azathioprine <END> withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities .
It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> associated with histological evidence of <START:Disease> bile duct injury <END> .
Severe immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> associated with prophylactic use of <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> in obstetric and gynecologic procedures .
Second - and third - generation <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> , especially <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> , are increasingly associated with severe , sometimes fatal immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemias <END> were in patients who had received <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures .
Eight of these cases of severe immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> are described .
Learning of rats under <START:Disease> amnesia <END> caused by <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> .
Dissociated learning of rats in the normal state and the state of <START:Disease> amnesia <END> produced by <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> ( 15 mg / kg , ip ) was carried out .
Rats were trained to approach a shelf where they received food reinforcement .
In Group 1 the rats were trained under the influence of <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> to run to the same shelf as in the normal state .
In Group 2 the rats were trained to approach different shelves in different drug states .
It was shown that <START:Disease> memory dissociation <END> occurred in both groups .
Differences in the parameters of training under the influence of <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> between Groups 1 and 2 were revealed .
These findings show that the brain - dissociated state induced by <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> is formed with the participation of the mechanisms of information perception .
<START:Chemical> Acetaminophen <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Through 30 years of widespread use , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dosages .
The potential for <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> to produce <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicities <END> is very low .
However , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of <START:Disease> anaphylaxis <END> , including <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , in sensitive individuals .
This article describes two <START:Disease> critically ill <END> patients in whom transient episodes of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> reproducibly developed after administration of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> .
Other symptoms of <START:Disease> allergic reactions <END> were not clinically detectable .
The <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> episodes were severe enough to require vasopressor administration .
The reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> in patients with <START:Disease> hypotension <END> of unknown origin .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> causes alterations in the MAP kinase - related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> .
<START:Disease> Aggressive behaviors <END> have been reported in patients who suffer from some <START:Disease> psychiatric disorders <END> , and are common in <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) abusers .
Herein , we report that multiple ( but not single ) injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> significantly increased <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> in male CD - 1 mice .
This increase in <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> was not secondary to <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase - related pathways after multiple and single <START:Chemical> METH <END> injections .
There were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decreases in MEK 1 , Erk 2 p , GSK 3 alpha , 14 - 3 - 3 e , and MEK 7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
MEK 1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of <START:Chemical> METH <END> , but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
In the frontal cortex , there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK 3 alpha after multiple ( but not single ) injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase - related pathways in the prefronto - striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of <START:Disease> aggressive behaviors <END> in mice .
<START:Disease> Toxicity <END> in rhesus monkeys following administration of the <START:Chemical> 8 - aminoquinoline <END> <START:Chemical> 8 - [ ( 4 - amino - l - methylbutyl ) amino ] - 5 - ( l - hexyloxy ) - 6 - methoxy - 4 - methylquinoline <END> ( <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> ) .
INTRODUCTION : Many substances that form methemoglobin ( MHb ) effectively counter cyanide ( CN ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN <START:Disease> poisoning <END> , it has been proposed that a stable , long - acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment .
Using this rationale , the <START:Chemical> 8 - aminoquinoline <END> <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> , a potent long - lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs , was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment .
METHODS : In this study , <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> was administered intravenously ( IV ) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3 . 5 and / or 7 . 0 mg / kg ; a single male also received <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> orally ( PO ) at 7 . 0 mg / kg .
Health status and MHb levels were monitored following exposure .
RESULTS : The selected doses of <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> , which produced significant <START:Disease> methemoglobinemia <END> in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere , produced very little MHb ( mean < 2 . 0 % ) in the rhesus monkey .
Furthermore , transient <START:Disease> hemoglobinuria <END> was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> ( 3 . 5 or 7 . 0 mg / kg ) , and 2 lethalities occurred ( one IV and one PO ) following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose .
<START:Disease> Myoglobinuria <END> was also observed following the 7 . 0 mg / kg dose .
Histopathology analyses in the 2 animals that died revealed <START:Disease> liver and kidney toxicity <END> , with greater severity in the orally - treated animal .
CONCLUSIONS : These data demonstrate direct and / or indirect drug - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
It is concluded that <START:Chemical> WR 242511 <END> should not be pursued as a pretreatment for CN <START:Disease> poisoning <END> unless the anti - CN characteristics of this compound can be successfully dissociated from those producing undesirable <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Risk of <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> after consumption of nonionic <START:Chemical> contrast media <END> by children undergoing cardiac angiography : a prospective study .
Despite increasing reports on nonionic <START:Chemical> contrast media <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> ( <START:Disease> CIN <END> ) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures , the studies in pediatrics are limited , with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography .
This prospective study determined the incidence of <START:Disease> CIN <END> for two nonionic <START:Chemical> contrast media <END> ( <START:Chemical> CM <END> ) , <START:Chemical> iopromide <END> and <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> , among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of <START:Chemical> CM <END> and the presence of <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> .
The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either <START:Chemical> iopromide <END> ( group A , n = 40 ) or <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> ( group B , n = 40 ) .
Serum <START:Chemical> sodium <END> ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> ) , <START:Chemical> potassium <END> ( <START:Chemical> K <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Cr <END> ) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values , then measured again at 12 - , 24 - , and 48 - h intervals after <START:Chemical> CM <END> use .
Urine samples for <START:Chemical> Na <END> and <START:Chemical> Cr <END> also were checked at the same intervals .
Risk of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , <START:Disease> Injury to the kidney <END> , <START:Disease> Failure of kidney function <END> , <START:Disease> Loss of kidney function <END> , and End - stage <START:Disease> renal damage <END> ( RIFLE criteria ) were used to define <START:Disease> CIN <END> and its incidence in the study population .
Accordingly , among the 15 <START:Disease> CIN <END> patients ( 18 . 75 % ) , 7 . 5 % of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3 . 75 % had <START:Disease> renal injury <END> , whereas 5 % of group B had increased risk and 2 . 5 % had <START:Disease> renal injury <END> .
Whereas 33 . 3 % of the patients with <START:Disease> CIN <END> were among those who received the proper dosage of <START:Chemical> CM <END> , the percentage increased to 66 . 6 % among those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of <START:Disease> CIN <END> related to the different dosages of <START:Chemical> CM <END> ( p = 0 . 014 ) .
Among the 15 patients with <START:Disease> CIN <END> , 6 had cyanotic <START:Disease> congenital heart diseases <END> , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients ( p = 0 . 243 ) .
Although clinically silent , <START:Disease> CIN <END> is not rare in pediatrics .
The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic <START:Chemical> CM <END> , nor on the presence of <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> , and although <START:Disease> CIN <END> usually is reversible , more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children .
<START:Chemical> Pentoxifylline <END> ( <START:Chemical> Trental <END> ) does not inhibit <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced coronary <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> : implications for <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 myocardial imaging .
<START:Chemical> Dipyridamole <END> - <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of <START:Disease> peripheral vascular disease <END> .
Many of these patients are taking <START:Chemical> pentoxifylline <END> ( <START:Chemical> Trental <END> ) , a <START:Chemical> methylxanthine <END> derivative which may improve <START:Disease> intermittent claudication <END> .
Whether <START:Chemical> pentoxifylline <END> inhibits <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced coronary <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> like other <START:Chemical> methylxanthines <END> such as <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> and should be stopped prior to <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 imaging is unknown .
Therefore , we studied the hyperemic response to <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> in seven open - chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either <START:Chemical> pentoxifylline <END> ( 0 , 7 . 5 , or 15 mg / kg i . v . ) or <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> ( 3 mg / kg i . v . ) .
Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups .
<START:Chemical> Dipyridamole <END> significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7 . 5 or 15 mm / kg i . v . <START:Chemical> pentoxifylline <END> ( p less than 0 . 002 ) .
Neither dose of <START:Chemical> pentoxifylline <END> significantly decreased the <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> , while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> pentoxyifylline <END> does not inhibit <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced coronary <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> even at high doses .
Expression of p 300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> is an anti - <START:Disease> tumor <END> agent that represses cardiac - specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> depletes cardiac p 300 , a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes .
However , the role of p 300 in protection against <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced apoptosis is unknown .
Transgenic mice overexpressing p 300 in the heart and wild - type mice were subjected to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> treatment .
Compared with wild - type mice , transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha - sarcomeric actin .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild - type mice but not in transgenic mice .
Expression of p 300 increased the cardiac level of bcl - 2 and mdm - 2 , but not that of p 53 or other members of the bcl - 2 family .
These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p 300 protects cardiac myocytes from <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute <START:Disease> heart failure <END> in adult mice in vivo .
<START:Chemical> Disulfiram <END> - induced transient <START:Disease> optic and peripheral neuropathy <END> : a case report .
AIM : To report a case of <START:Disease> optic and peripheral neuropathy <END> after chronic use of <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> for <START:Disease> alcohol dependence <END> management .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : A case report .
RESULTS : A 57 - year - old male presented with gradual <START:Disease> loss of vision <END> in both eyes with intermittent <START:Disease> headaches <END> for 2 months .
He also complained of <START:Disease> paraesthesia <END> with <START:Disease> numbness <END> in both feet .
His vision was 6 / 15 and 2 / 60 in the right and left eyes , respectively .
Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads .
Visual field testing confirmed bilateral central - caecal <START:Disease> scotomata <END> .
He had been taking <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> for <START:Disease> alcohol dependence <END> for the preceding 3 years .
<START:Chemical> Disulfiram <END> discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement .
CONCLUSION : Physicians initiating long - term <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> therapy should be aware of these adverse effects .
They should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing .
Patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> - associated , benign transient <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> in <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patients with a past history of <START:Chemical> LSD <END> abuse .
Two <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patients , who had a prior history of <START:Chemical> LSD <END> abuse and who had previously developed <START:Disease> EPS <END> with classic antipsychotics , were successfully treated with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
They both reported short episodes of transient <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> , which appeared immediately after starting treatment with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
This imagery resembled <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> previously experienced as " flashbacks " related to prior <START:Chemical> LSD <END> consumption .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> administration was continued and the <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> gradually wore off .
During a six - month follow - up period , there was no recurrence of <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> .
This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign , short - term and self - limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> or interfere with treatment .
Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution .
<START:Chemical> Acetazolamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> : implications for treatment of <START:Disease> neuromuscular disorders <END> .
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can cause <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> .
We studied 20 patients receiving long - term carbonic anhydrase inhibitor treatment for periodic <START:Disease> paralysis <END> and <START:Disease> myotonia <END> .
Three patients on <START:Chemical> acetazolamide <END> ( 15 % ) developed <START:Disease> renal calculi <END> .
Extracorporeal lithotripsy successfully removed a <START:Disease> renal calculus <END> in one patient and surgery removed a staghorn <START:Disease> calculus <END> in another , permitting continued treatment .
Renal function remained normal in all patients .
<START:Disease> Nephrolithiasis <END> is a complication of <START:Chemical> acetazolamide <END> but does not preclude its use .
Transient <START:Disease> platypnea - orthodeoxia - like syndrome <END> induced by <START:Chemical> propafenone <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> in a young woman with <START:Disease> Ebstein ' s anomaly <END> .
In this report we describe the case of a 37 - year - old white woman with <START:Disease> Ebstein ' s anomaly <END> , who developed a rare syndrome called <START:Disease> platypnea - orthodeoxia <END> , characterized by massive right - to - left interatrial shunting with transient profound <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> and <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> .
This shunt of blood via a <START:Disease> patent foramen ovale <END> occurred in the presence of a normal pulmonary artery pressure , and was probably precipitated by a <START:Chemical> propafenone <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
This drug caused <START:Disease> biventricular dysfunction <END> , due to its negative inotropic effect , and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , due to its peripheral vasodilatory effect .
These effects gave rise to an increase in the right atrial pressure and a decrease in the left one with a consequent stretching of the foramen ovale and the creation of massive right - to - left shunting .
In our case this interatrial shunt was very accurately detected at bubble contrast echocardiography .
<START:Disease> Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> complicating <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ( <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ) therapy .
We describe 3 episodes of <START:Disease> microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> ( <START:Disease> MAHA <END> ) in 2 solid organ recipients under <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ( <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ) therapy .
In both cases , discontinuation of <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> and treatment with plasma exchange , fresh frozen plasma replacement , <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> , <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> , and <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> led to resolution of <START:Disease> MAHA <END> .
In one patient , reintroduction of <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> led to rapid recurrence of <START:Disease> MAHA <END> .
<START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - associated <START:Disease> MAHA <END> is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complication .
In our experience and according to the literature , <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> does not seem to cross - react with <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> ( <START:Chemical> CyA <END> ) , an immuno - suppressive drug already known to induce <START:Disease> MAHA <END> .
Effect of switching <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> to <START:Chemical> oxcarbazepine <END> on the plasma levels of neuroleptics .
A case report .
<START:Chemical> Carbamazepine <END> was switched to its 10 - keto analogue <START:Chemical> oxcarbazepine <END> among six difficult - to - treat <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> or <START:Disease> organic psychotic <END> patients using concomitantly <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , <START:Chemical> chlorpromazine <END> or <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
This change resulted within 2 - 4 weeks in the 50 - 200 % increase in the plasma levels of these neuroleptics and the appearance of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> .
None of the patients showed any clinical deteriotation during the following 3 - 6 months .
The results of this case report support the idea that in contrast with <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> <START:Chemical> oxcarbazepine <END> does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs .
Effects of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers on <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers on <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
For each of the three tested <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers ( <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> and <START:Chemical> bepridil <END> ) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses , i . e . 2 and 10 mg / kg / i . p . , or an equal volume of saline for the control group ( n = 20 ) ; 15 minutes later , all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg / kg / i . p . dose of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
The convulsant activity , the time of latency to convulse and the mortality rate were assessed in each group .
The local anesthetic - induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers .
The convulsant activity of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> was not significantly modified but <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> ; this effect was less pronounced with <START:Chemical> bepridil <END> .
Delayed <START:Disease> asystolic <END> <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> after <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> ; resuscitation with high dose intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium <END> .
A 51 year old man took a mixed <START:Disease> overdose <END> including 1 . 8 - 3 . 6 g of <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> , <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> , <START:Chemical> isosorbide <END> <START:Chemical> nitrate <END> , and <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> .
He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids .
Eighteen hours after the <START:Disease> overdose <END> he had two generalised <START:Disease> tonic - clonic seizures <END> .
The patient remained unresponsive with junctional <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , unrecordable blood pressure , and then became <START:Disease> asystolic <END> .
He was resuscitated with high dose ( 13 . 5 g ) intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> ( <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ) .
He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours .
This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium <END> therapy in severe <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , particularly with the onset of <START:Disease> asystole <END> .
It should be considered early in cases of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> after <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The case also highlights the problems with delayed <START:Disease> toxicity <END> when whole bowel irrigation is not administered .
<START:Disease> Coronary aneurysm <END> after implantation of a <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> - eluting stent .
Formation of <START:Disease> coronary aneurysm <END> is a rare complication of stenting with bare metal stents , but based on experimental studies drug - eluting stents may induce toxic effects on the vessel wall with incomplete stent apposition , <START:Disease> aneurysm <END> formation and with the potential of stent <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> or <START:Disease> vessel rupture <END> .
We present a 43 - year - old man who developed a <START:Disease> coronary aneurysm <END> in the right coronary artery 6 months after receiving a <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> - eluting stent .
The patient was asymptomatic and the <START:Disease> aneurysm <END> was detected in a routine control .
Angiography and intracoronary ultrasound demonstrated lack of contact between stent and vessel wall in a 15 - mm long segment with maximal <START:Disease> aneurysm <END> diameter of 6 . 0 mm .
The patient was successfully treated with a graft stent .
The haemodynamic effects of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> in elderly patients ( ASA groups 3 and 4 ) .
The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> are disadvantages in frail elderly patients .
We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> to <START:Chemical> propofol <END> in order to obtund the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response .
The haemodynamic effects of adding 15 , 20 or 25 mg of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> to 200 mg of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> were compared to control in 40 ASA 3 / 4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito - urinary surgery .
The addition of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> to <START:Chemical> propofol <END> appears to be an effective method of obtunding the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response to <START:Chemical> propofol <END> at all doses used in this study .
However , marked <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> occurred in the majority of patients , occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients .
Due to the risk of this <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> inducing <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> , we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> / <START:Chemical> propofol <END> / mixtures studied .
Effects of <START:Chemical> tetrandrine <END> and <START:Chemical> fangchinoline <END> on experimental <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> in mice and human <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Tetrandrine <END> ( <START:Chemical> TET <END> ) and <START:Chemical> fangchinoline <END> ( <START:Chemical> FAN <END> ) are two naturally occurring analogues with a <START:Chemical> bisbenzylisoquinoline <END> structure .
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of <START:Chemical> TET <END> and <START:Chemical> FAN <END> on the experimental <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> induced by collagen plus <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ( <START:Chemical> EP <END> ) in mice , and <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> and <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> in vitro .
In the in vivo study , the administration ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) of <START:Chemical> TET <END> and <START:Chemical> FAN <END> in mice showed the inhibition of <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> by 55 % and 35 % , respectively , while <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> ASA <END> , 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) , a positive control , showed only 30 % inhibition .
In the vitro human <START:Disease> platelet aggregations <END> induced by the agonists used in tests , <START:Chemical> TET <END> and <START:Chemical> FAN <END> showed the inhibitions dose dependently .
In addition , neither <START:Chemical> TET <END> nor <START:Chemical> FAN <END> showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) and thrombin time ( TT ) using human - citrated plasma .
These results suggest that antithrombosis of <START:Chemical> TET <END> and <START:Chemical> FAN <END> in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities .
Effects of <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> and ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> , putative sigma 2 - preferring antagonists , on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> in mice .
Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma 1 receptors attenuates the <START:Disease> convulsive <END> , lethal , locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> in mice .
In contrast , the contribution of sigma 2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable .
To begin addressing this need , we characterized <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 1 - ( 2 - phenethyl ) - 4 - ( 2 - pyridyl ) - piperazine <END> ) and ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - tropanyl - 2 - ( 4 - chorophenoxy ) butyrate <END> ) in receptor binding and behavioral studies .
Receptor binding studies confirmed that <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> and ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> display preferential affinity for sigma 2 over sigma 1 receptors .
In behavioral studies , pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> or ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> significantly attenuated <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and locomotor activity , but not lethality .
When administered alone , ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline , but <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> had locomotor depressant actions .
Together , the data suggest that sigma 2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> , and further development of more selective , high affinity ligands are warranted .
Differential impact of immune escape mutations G 145 R and P 120 T on the replication of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - resistant <START:Chemical> hepatitis B virus e antigen <END> - positive and - negative strains .
Immune escape variants of the <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> virus ( HBV ) represent an emerging clinical challenge , because they can be associated with vaccine escape , HBV reactivation , and failure of diagnostic tests .
Recent data suggest a preferential selection of immune escape mutants in distinct peripheral blood leukocyte compartments of infected individuals .
We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants , the sG 145 R and sP 120 T mutants , on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment - associated mutants with resistance to <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> ( <START:Chemical> LAM <END> ) and / or <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> negativity .
Replication - competent HBV strains with sG 145 R or sP 120 T and <START:Chemical> LAM <END> resistance ( rtM 204 I or rtL 180 M / rtM 204 V ) were generated on an <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> - positive and an <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> - negative background with precore ( PC ) and basal core promoter ( BCP ) mutants .
The sG 145 R mutation strongly reduced <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> levels and was able to fully restore the impaired replication of <START:Chemical> LAM <END> - resistant HBV mutants to the levels of wild - type HBV , and PC or BCP mutations further enhanced viral replication .
Although the sP 120 T substitution also impaired <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> secretion , it did not enhance the replication of <START:Chemical> LAM <END> - resistant clones .
However , the concomitant occurrence of <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> negativity ( PC / BCP ) , sP 120 T , and <START:Chemical> LAM <END> resistance resulted in the restoration of replication to levels of wild - type HBV .
In all clones with combined immune escape and <START:Chemical> LAM <END> resistance mutations , the <START:Chemical> nucleotide <END> analogues <START:Chemical> adefovir <END> and <START:Chemical> tenofovir <END> remained effective in suppressing viral replication in vitro .
These findings reveal the differential impact of immune escape variants on the replication and drug susceptibility of complex HBV mutants , supporting the need of close surveillance and treatment adjustment in response to the selection of distinct mutational patterns .
Is the treatment of <START:Disease> scabies <END> hazardous ?
Treatment for <START:Disease> scabies <END> is usually initiated by general practitioners ; most consider <START:Chemical> lindane <END> ( <START:Chemical> gamma benzene hexachloride <END> ) the treatment of choice .
<START:Chemical> Lindane <END> is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide , and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well understood .
Evidence is accumulating that <START:Chemical> lindane <END> can be <START:Disease> toxic to the central nervous system <END> and may be associated with <START:Disease> aplastic anaemia <END> .
Preparations containing <START:Chemical> lindane <END> continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patients .
This literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe scabicides with increased caution for certain at - risk groups , and give adequate warnings regarding potential <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Mitomycin C <END> associated <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Mitomycin C <END> associated <START:Disease> Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> HUS <END> ) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised .
It consists of microangiopathic <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> and progressive <START:Disease> renal failure <END> associated with <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> treatment and affects about 10 % of patients treated with this agent .
The <START:Disease> renal failure <END> usually develops about 8 - 10 mth after start of <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> treatment and the mortality is approximately 60 % from <START:Disease> renal failure <END> or <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> .
<START:Disease> Renal lesions <END> are similar to those seen in idiopathic <START:Disease> HUS <END> and include arteriolar fibrin <START:Disease> thrombi <END> , expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls , <START:Disease> ischemic <END> wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis .
The mechanism of action is postulated as <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> - induced endothelial cell damage .
We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr - old man with <START:Disease> gastric adenocarcinoma <END> who developed <START:Disease> renal failure <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> while on treatment with <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> and died in <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> - associated <START:Disease> cognitive and functional deficits <END> reduced by a switch to <START:Chemical> divalproex sodium <END> : a case series .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Lithium <END> remains a first - line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of <START:Disease> bipolar disorder <END> .
Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , such as <START:Disease> polyuria <END> and <START:Disease> tremor <END> , more subtle <START:Chemical> lithium <END> side effects such as <START:Disease> cognitive deficits <END> , <START:Disease> loss of creativity <END> , and <START:Disease> functional impairments <END> remain understudied .
This report summarizes our experience in switching <START:Disease> bipolar <END> patients from <START:Chemical> lithium <END> to <START:Chemical> divalproex sodium <END> to alleviate such <START:Disease> cognitive and functional impairments <END> .
METHOD : Open , case series design .
RESULTS : We report seven cases where substitution of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , either fully or partially , with <START:Chemical> divalproex sodium <END> was extremely helpful in reducing the <START:Disease> cognitive , motivational , or creative deficits <END> attributed to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> in our <START:Disease> bipolar <END> patients .
CONCLUSION : In this preliminary report , <START:Chemical> divalproex sodium <END> was a superior alternative to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> in <START:Disease> bipolar <END> patients experiencing <START:Disease> cognitive deficits <END> , <START:Disease> loss of creativity <END> , and <START:Disease> functional impairments <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dobutamine <END> stress echocardiography : a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - treated long - term survivors of childhood <START:Disease> cancer <END> .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for <START:Disease> cardiac damage <END> due to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> , a cohort study was performed using <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long - term survivors of childhood <START:Disease> cancer <END> treated with <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> from healthy control subjects .
Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients ( mean age 16 + / - 5 years ) treated from 1 . 6 to 14 . 3 years ( median 5 . 3 ) before this study with 27 to 532 mg / m 2 of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( mean 196 ) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age - matched control subjects .
Graded <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusions of 0 . 5 , 2 . 5 , 5 and 10 micrograms / kg per min were administered .
Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate .
<START:Chemical> Dobutamine <END> infusion at 10 micrograms / kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50 % incidence rate of adverse symptoms .
The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects , end - systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stimulation .
End - systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - treated group was 11 + / - 1 . 9 mm versus 13 . 1 + / - 1 . 5 mm for control subjects ( p less than 0 . 01 ) .
End - systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5 - micrograms / kg per min <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion for the <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - treated group was 14 . 1 + / - 2 . 4 mm versus 19 . 3 + / - 2 . 6 mm for control subjects ( p less than 0 . 01 ) . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Design and analysis of the HYPREN - trial : safety of <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> and <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> in the initial treatment phase of patients with <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> .
Since the introduction of <START:Chemical> angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors <END> into the adjunctive treatment of patients with <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> , cases of severe <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , especially on the first day of treatment , have occasionally been reported .
To assess the safety of the <START:Chemical> ACE inhibitor <END> <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> a multicenter , randomized , <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> - controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic <START:Disease> hypotension <END> on the first day of treatment .
Trial medication was 2 . 5 mg <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> or 0 . 5 <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> .
Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class II and III .
Patients who received <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( 5 . 2 % ) than the patients who received <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( 12 . 9 % ) .
All patients recovered .
It was concluded that treatment with <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> was well tolerated and it is , therefore , unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> to inpatients .
<START:Disease> Bile duct hamartoma <END> occurring in association with long - term treatment with <START:Chemical> danazol <END> .
We report a case of <START:Disease> bile duct hamartoma <END> which developed in a patient who had been on long - term <START:Chemical> danazol <END> treatment .
Such patients should be under close follow - up , preferably with periodic ultrasound examination of the liver .
If the patient develops a <START:Disease> liver mass <END> , because of non - specific clinical features and imaging appearances , biopsy may be the only way to achieve a definitive diagnosis .
<START:Chemical> Ciprofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in patients with <START:Disease> cancer <END> .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> is uncommon .
Five patients with <START:Disease> cancer <END> who developed <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> that followed treatment with <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed .
Other than elevation of serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels , characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present .
Allergic <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> is believed to be the underlying pathological - process .
Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy , although this is not always feasible .
An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
Neuroprotective action of <START:Chemical> MPEP <END> , a selective mGluR 5 antagonist , in <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced dopaminergic <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is associated with a decrease in <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> outflow and inhibition of <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> in rats .
The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptor 5 ( mGluR 5 ) in the toxic action of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> on dopaminergic neurones in rats .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> ( 10 mg / kg sc ) , administered five times , reduced the levels of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection .
A selective antagonist of mGluR 5 , <START:Chemical> 2 - methyl - 6 - ( phenylethynyl ) pyridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MPEP <END> ; 5 mg / kg ip ) , when administered five times immediately before each <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> injection reversed the above - mentioned <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> effects .
A single <START:Chemical> MPEP <END> ( 5 mg / kg ip ) injection reduced the basal extracellular <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> level in the striatum , as well as <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> release stimulated either by <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( 10 mg / kg sc ) or by intrastriatally administered <START:Chemical> veratridine <END> ( 100 microM ) .
Moreover , it transiently diminished the <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( 10 mg / kg sc ) - induced <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> and reduced basal body temperature .
<START:Chemical> MPEP <END> administered into the striatum at high concentrations ( 500 microM ) increased extracellular <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> levels , while lower concentrations ( 50 - 100 microM ) were devoid of any effect .
The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR 5 by <START:Chemical> MPEP <END> may protect dopaminergic neurones against <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Neuroprotection rendered by <START:Chemical> MPEP <END> may be associated with the reduction of the <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR 5 , and with a decrease in <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> facilitates reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> in conscious rats .
The effects of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats .
Intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 1 - 30 mg kg - 1 ) produced a dose - dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate .
Also , reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> ( 1 . 25 - 2 . 5 micrograms kg - 1 ) .
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , although causing no change in the <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced pressor effect , did enhance the <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
However , the <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> enhancement of <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> ( an agent blocks <START:Chemical> chloride <END> channels by binding to sites associated with the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> - <START:Chemical> GABA <END> - <START:Chemical> chloride <END> channel macromolecular complex ) .
The data indicate that <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> acts through the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> - <START:Chemical> GABA <END> - <START:Chemical> chloride <END> channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure .
Complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> following a single dose of <START:Chemical> trazodone <END> .
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of <START:Chemical> trazodone <END> , a patient developed complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> .
The case illustrates that , despite the results of earlier studies , <START:Chemical> trazodone <END> ' s effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay .
<START:Chemical> Methimazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestatic jaundice <END> .
<START:Chemical> Methimazole <END> is a widely used and generally well - tolerated antithyroid agent .
A 43 - year - old woman had severe <START:Disease> jaundice <END> and <START:Disease> itching <END> 1 month after receiving <START:Chemical> methimazole <END> ( 10 mg tid ) and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> ( 20 mg tid ) for treatment of <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> .
The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of <START:Disease> jaundice <END> until she finished both medications .
When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later , she still had severe <START:Disease> icterus <END> , <START:Disease> pruritus <END> , and <START:Disease> hyperbilirubinemia <END> , formed mainly of the conjugated fraction .
<START:Chemical> Methimazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> was diagnosed , and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> therapy was resumed .
Over the following 9 days , the symptoms improved and plasma <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> levels were normal after 12 weeks without <START:Chemical> methimazole <END> .
In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy , this drug can cause severe and reversible <START:Disease> cholestatic jaundice <END> .
Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that , upon occurrence , they can discontinue <START:Chemical> methimazole <END> therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures .
Development of <START:Disease> clear cell adenocarcinoma <END> in <START:Chemical> DES <END> - exposed offspring under observation .
Two cases of <START:Disease> clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina <END> detected at follow - up in young women exposed in utero to <START:Chemical> diethylstilbestrol <END> are reported .
One patient , aged 23 , had been followed for 2 years before <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> was diagnosed ; the second patient , aged 22 , had been seen on a regular basis for 5 years , 8 months .
In both instances , suspicion of the presence of <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> was aroused by the palpation of a small nodule in the vaginal fornix .
Hysterosalpingography was performed on both patients and , in 1 instance , an abnormal x - ray film was reflected by the gross appearance of the uterine cavity found in the surgical specimen .
<START:Chemical> Thiazide <END> diuretics , <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> .
<START:Chemical> Thiazide <END> diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs .
<START:Disease> Hypokalemia <END> is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> therapy .
We treated 38 patients ( 22 low renin , 16 normal renin ) with moderate <START:Disease> diastolic hypertension <END> with <START:Chemical> hydrochlorothiazide <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCTC <END> ) administered on a twice daily schedule .
Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg , 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized .
The serum <START:Chemical> K <END> during the control period was 4 . 5 + / - 0 . 2 mEq / l an on 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 mg <START:Chemical> HCTZ <END> daily 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 3 , 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 , 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 2 , and 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 mEq / l , respectively .
Corresponding figures for whole body <START:Chemical> K <END> were 4107 + / - 208 , 3722 + / - 319 , 3628 + / - 257 , 3551 + / - 336 , and 3269 + / - 380 mEq , respectively .
In 13 patients we observed the effects of <START:Chemical> HCTZ <END> therapy ( 100 mg daily ) on the occurrence of PVC ' s during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise .
During rest we observed 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 08 PVC beats / min + / - SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 06 and 0 . 8 + / - 0 . 15 , respectively .
Corresponding figures during <START:Chemical> HCTZ <END> therapy 100 mg daily were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 1 , 3 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 and 5 . 7 4 / - 0 . 8 , respectively .
The occurrence of PVC ' s correlated significantly with the fall in serum <START:Chemical> K <END> + observed r = 0 . 72 , p less than 0 . 001 .
In conclusion we found that <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> diuretics cause <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> and depletion of body <START:Chemical> potassium <END> .
The more profound <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> , the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC ' s .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> and thalamotomy .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> of the limbs in thirteen cases of <START:Disease> Parkinsonism <END> , which was choreic , ballistic or <START:Disease> dystonic <END> in type , was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus , but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus .
Control of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> by <START:Disease> thalamic lesions <END> in the course of routine treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinsonism <END> is discussed .
<START:Chemical> Phenylephrine <END> but not <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> <START:Disease> reduces frontal lobe oxygenation <END> following anesthesia - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
BACKGROUND : Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
We describe the effect of <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> and <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> on frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 )) following anesthesia - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
METHODS : Following induction of anesthesia by <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> ( 0 . 15 mg kg ( - 1 )) and <START:Chemical> propofol <END> ( 2 . 0 mg kg ( - 1 )) , 13 patients received <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> ( 0 . 1 mg iv ) and 12 patients received <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> ( 10 mg iv ) to restore mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) .
Heart rate ( HR ) , MAP , <START:Disease> stroke <END> volume ( SV ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , and frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 )) were registered .
RESULTS : Induction of anesthesia was followed by <START:Disease> a decrease in MAP , HR , SV , and CO <END> concomitant with an elevation in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .
After administration of <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> , MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ; mean + / - SD ) .
However , a 14 % ( from 70 + / - 8 % to 60 + / - 7 % ) reduction in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) followed with no change in CO ( 3 . 7 + / - 1 . 1 to 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 9 l min ( - 1 )) .
The administration of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> led to a similar increase in MAP ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ) , restored CO ( 3 . 2 + / - 1 . 2 to 5 . 0 + / - 1 . 3 l min ( - 1 )) , and preserved S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The utilization of <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> to correct <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S ( c ) O ( 2 ) while <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO .
Protective effect of a specific platelet - activating factor antagonist , <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> , on <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular impairments <END> in rats .
Administration of the local anaesthetic <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( 1 . 5 or 2 mg / kg , i . v . ) to rats elicited a marked <START:Disease> decrease of mean arterial blood pressure ( MBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) <END> leading to death ( in 67 % or 90 % of animals respectively ) .
Intravenous injection of the specific platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) antagonist <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) , 30 min before <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> administration ( 2 mg / kg i . v . ) suppressed both the <START:Disease> decrease of MBP and HR <END> .
In contrast , doses of 1 mg / kg <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> given 30 min before or 10 mg / kg administered 5 min before i . v . injection of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> were ineffective .
When <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> ( 20 mg / kg i . v . ) was injected immediately after <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( 2 mg / kg ) , a partial reversion of the <START:Disease> decrease of MBP and HR <END> was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg / kg was ineffective .
A partial recovery of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> .
Since the administration of <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> , at all doses studied , did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used , the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> , a specific antagonist of PAF , against <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicity <END> .
Thus , consistent with its direct effect on heart , PAF appears to be implicated in <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular alterations <END> .
In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and <START:Disease> necrotic <END> cell deaths during <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> - induced <START:Disease> lung toxicity <END> and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> by a novel <START:Chemical> IH 636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract <END> .
<START:Chemical> Grape seed extract <END> , primarily a mixture of <START:Chemical> proanthocyanidins <END> , has been shown to modulate a wide - range of biological , pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective .
This study assessed the ability of <START:Chemical> IH 636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract <END> ( <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> ) to prevent <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( <START:Chemical> AAP <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> ( <START:Chemical> AMI <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> lung toxicity <END> , and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> in mice .
Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> alone , drug alone and <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> + drug .
For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> for 7 - 10 days followed by i . p . injections of organ specific three drugs ( <START:Chemical> AAP <END> : 500 mg / Kg for 24 h ; <START:Chemical> AMI <END> : 50 mg / Kg / day for four days ; <START:Chemical> DOX <END> : 20 mg / Kg for 48 h ) .
Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent ) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues .
Results indicate that <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> preexposure prior to <START:Chemical> AAP <END> , <START:Chemical> AMI <END> and <START:Chemical> DOX <END> , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation .
Histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive <START:Disease> tissue damage <END> with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> preexposure than in its presence .
<START:Chemical> GSPE <END> + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .
Additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation .
Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , <START:Chemical> AAP <END> , <START:Chemical> AMI <END> and <START:Chemical> DOX <END> induced apoptotic death in addition to <START:Disease> necrosis <END> in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> .
Since <START:Chemical> AAP <END> , <START:Chemical> AMI <END> and <START:Chemical> DOX <END> undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .
In addition , its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .
Additionally , this may have been the first report on <START:Chemical> AMI <END> - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .
Taken together , these events undoubtedly establish <START:Chemical> GSPE <END> ' s abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo .
Pallidal stimulation : an alternative to pallidotomy ?
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985 .
Laitinen ' s procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant <START:Disease> PD <END> , which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community .
Another lesioning procedure , ventrolateral thalamotomy , has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius , producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates .
Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success .
According to the literature pallidotomy improves the " on " symptoms of <START:Disease> PD <END> , such as <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , as well as the " off " symptoms , such as <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> bradykinesia <END> , and on - off fluctuations .
Pallidal stimulation improves <START:Disease> bradykinesia <END> and <START:Disease> rigidity <END> to a minor extent ; however , its strength seems to be in improving <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Stimulation often produces an improvement in the <START:Disease> hyper - or dyskinetic <END> upper limbs , but increases the " freezing " phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time .
Considering the small increase in the patient ' s independence , the high costs of bilateral implants , and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices , the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy .
Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> in elderly patients undergoing <START:Disease> hip fracture <END> repair .
OBJECTIVE : To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for <START:Disease> hip fracture <END> repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : We performed a double - blind , randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years ) without preoperative <START:Disease> delirium <END> or severe <START:Disease> dementia <END> who underwent <START:Disease> hip fracture <END> repair under spinal anesthesia with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> sedation .
Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS ) , and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS , approximately 50 ) or light ( BIS , > or = 80 ) sedation .
<START:Disease> Postoperative delirium <END> was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <START:Disease> Mental Disorders <END> ( Third Edition Revised ) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery .
RESULTS : From April 2 , 2005 , through October 30 , 2008 , a total of 114 patients were randomized .
The prevalence of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19 % ] vs 23 / 57 [ 40 % ] in the deep sedation group ; P = . 02 ) , indicating that 1 incident of <START:Disease> delirium <END> will be prevented for every 4 . 7 patients treated with light sedation .
The mean + / - SD number of days of <START:Disease> delirium <END> during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group ( 0 . 5 + / - 1 . 5 days vs 1 . 4 + / - 4 . 0 days ; P = . 01 ) .
CONCLUSION : The use of light <START:Chemical> propofol <END> sedation decreased the prevalence of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> by 50 % compared with deep sedation .
Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple , safe , and cost - effective intervention for preventing <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted .
An evaluation of <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in the hematology / oncology population .
<START:Chemical> Amikacin <END> is an <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> commonly used to provide empirical double gram - negative treatment for <START:Disease> febrile neutropenia <END> and other suspected <START:Disease> infections <END> .
Strategies of extended - interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population ; however , data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology / oncology population .
To evaluate <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> - associated <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in an adult hematology / oncology population , a prospective , randomized , open - label trial was conducted at a university - affiliated medical center .
Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a <START:Disease> hematologic / oncologic disorder <END> that required treatment with an <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> were randomized to either conventional or extended - interval <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> by means of an increase in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and evaluation of efficacy via <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> was similar between the conventional and extended - interval groups , at 10 % and 5 % , respectively ( P = 1 . 00 ) .
Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture , compared with none in the extended - interval group ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> was similar between the two dosing regimens , but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups .
Efficacy could not be assessed .
Acute bronchodilating effects of <START:Chemical> ipratropium bromide <END> and <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> in <START:Disease> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> .
The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of <START:Chemical> ipratropium bromide <END> aerosol ( 36 micrograms ) and short - acting <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> tablets ( dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10 - 20 micrograms / mL ) were compared in a double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable , <START:Disease> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> .
Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV 1 ) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15 % increase in the FEV 1 ( responders ) were 31 % and 90 % , respectively , for <START:Chemical> ipratropium <END> and 17 % and 50 % , respectively , for <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> .
The average FEV 1 increases during the 6 - hour observation period were 18 % for <START:Chemical> ipratropium <END> and 8 % for <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> .
The mean duration of action was 3 . 8 hours with <START:Chemical> ipratropium <END> and 2 . 4 hours with <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> .
While side effects were rare , those experienced after <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> use did involve the <START:Disease> cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems <END> .
These results show that <START:Chemical> ipratropium <END> is a more potent bronchodilator than oral <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> in patients with <START:Disease> chronic airflow obstruction <END> .
Quantitative drug levels in stimulant <START:Disease> psychosis <END> : relationship to symptom severity , <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> and <START:Disease> hyperkinesia <END> .
To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels , <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> , and <START:Disease> psychotic symptoms <END> , nineteen patients in a <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> emergency service with a diagnosis of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - or <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> were interviewed , and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> metabolite levels .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global <START:Disease> hyperkinesia <END> rating .
HVA levels were related to global <START:Disease> hyperkinesia <END> but not to psychopathology ratings .
Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role , intensity of stimulant - induced <START:Disease> psychotic symptoms <END> and <START:Disease> stereotypies <END> appears to be at least in part dose - related .
Treatment of previously treated metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> by <START:Chemical> mitoxantrone <END> and 48 - hour continuous infusion of high - dose <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> and <START:Chemical> leucovorin <END> ( <START:Chemical> MFL <END> ) : low palliative benefit and high treatment - related <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
For previously treated advanced <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , there is no standard second - line therapy .
Combination chemotherapy with <START:Chemical> mitoxantrone <END> , high - dose <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) and <START:Chemical> leucovorin <END> ( <START:Chemical> MFL regimen <END> ) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated regimen .
From October 1993 to November 1995 , we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy - treated metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> by <START:Chemical> mitoxantrone <END> , 12 mg / m 2 , on day 1 and continuous infusion of <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> , 3000 mg / m 2 , together with <START:Chemical> leucovorin <END> , 300 mg / m 2 , for 48 h from day 1 to 2 .
Each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 weeks .
Most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites , with lung metastasis predominant .
Seven patients had been treated with <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> .
Seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therapy .
Median number of courses of <START:Chemical> MFL regimen <END> given was six and the median cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> mitoxantrone <END> was 68 . 35 mg / m 2 .
One patient had complete response , seven had stable disease , none had partial response and five had progressive disease .
The overall objective response rate was 7 . 6 % .
The median follow - up period was 14 months .
Median survival was 16 months .
Median progression - free survival was 5 months .
A complete responder had relapse - free survival up to 17 months .
Major <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> .
Eight patients were dead in the last follow - up ; two of them died of treatment - related <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The <START:Chemical> MFL regimen <END> achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe <START:Disease> toxicity <END> at a fairly high rate .
Administration of this regimen to <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with <START:Disease> impaired heart function <END> requires careful attention .
<START:Chemical> Thalidomide <END> has limited single - agent activity in relapsed or refractory indolent <START:Disease> non - Hodgkin lymphomas <END> : a phase II trial of the <START:Disease> Cancer <END> and <START:Disease> Leukemia <END> Group B .
<START:Chemical> Thalidomide <END> is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in <START:Disease> multiple myeloma <END> , <START:Disease> mantle cell lymphoma <END> and <START:Disease> lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma <END> .
Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the <START:Disease> tumour <END> milieu , including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines .
Between July 2001 and April 2004 , 24 patients with relapsed / refractory indolent <START:Disease> lymphomas <END> received <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> 200 mg daily with escalation by 100 mg daily every 1 - 2 weeks as tolerated , up to a maximum of 800 mg daily .
Patients had received a median of 2 ( range , 1 - 4 ) prior regimens .
Of 24 evaluable patients , two achieved a complete remission and one achieved a partial remission for an overall response rate of 12 . 5 % ( 95 % confidence interval : 2 . 6 - 32 . 4 % ) .
Eleven patients progressed during therapy .
Grade 3 - 4 adverse effects included <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> , <START:Disease> fatigue <END> , <START:Disease> somnolence <END> / <START:Disease> depressed mood <END> , <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> and <START:Disease> dyspnea <END> .
Of concern was the occurrence of four <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> events .
Our results failed to demonstrate an important response rate to single agent <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in indolent <START:Disease> lymphomas <END> and contrast with the higher activity level reported with the second generation immunomodulatory agent , <START:Chemical> lenalidomide <END> .
<START:Chemical> Valproic acid <END> induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> -- 19 new cases in Germany from 1994 to 2003 -- a side effect associated to <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - therapy not only in young children .
<START:Chemical> Valproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) is a broad - spectrum antiepileptic drug and is usually well - tolerated .
Rare serious complications may occur in some patients , including haemorrhagic <START:Disease> pancreatitis <END> , <START:Disease> bone marrow suppression <END> , <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> and <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> .
The typical signs of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> are <START:Disease> impaired consciousness <END> , sometimes marked EEG background slowing , increased <START:Disease> seizure <END> frequency , with or without <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> .
There is still no proof of causative effect of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> in patients with <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> , but only of an association with an assumed causal relation .
We report 19 patients with <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - associated <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> in Germany from the years 1994 to 2003 , none of whom had been published previously .
Comparison of the effectiveness of <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> and <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
The H 2 - <START:Chemical> histamine <END> receptor antagonists <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> and <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short - and long - term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states .
Nineteen patients had <START:Disease> Zollinger - Ellison syndrome <END> , one patient had <START:Disease> systemic mastocytosis <END> , and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion .
The rates of onset of the action of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> and <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> were the same .
The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents , and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion .
However , <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> was threefold more potent than <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed ( 1 . 2 g per day for <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> and 3 . 6 g per day for <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> ) .
Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or <START:Disease> impotence <END> while taking <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> and in all cases these changes disappeared when <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> was replaced by <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> .
Treatment with high doses of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> ( one to 60 months ; median , 11 months ) or <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> ( two to 31 months ; median , 14 months ) was not associated with <START:Disease> hepatic or hematologic toxicity <END> or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations , but <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> level than seen with <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> therapy .
The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
Both are safe at high doses , but <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
Ocular manifestations of <START:Disease> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We followed 210 cases of <START:Disease> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> closely for eleven years .
Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17 . 2 % ) developed <START:Disease> iridocyclitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Iridocyclitis <END> was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the <START:Disease> arthritis <END> .
However , 30 % of the patients developed <START:Disease> uveitis <END> after 16 years of age .
Although 61 % of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active <START:Disease> uveitis <END> on entry .
Our approach was effective in detecting <START:Disease> uveitis <END> in new cases and exacerbations of <START:Disease> uveitis <END> in established cases .
Forty - four percent of patients with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , <START:Disease> ocular pain <END> , <START:Disease> decreased visual acuity <END> , or <START:Disease> photophobia <END> , in order of decreasing frequency .
Even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of <START:Disease> uveitis <END> did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> and mydriatics .
Despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of <START:Disease> uveitis <END> cited in earlier studies .
<START:Disease> Cataract <END> and <START:Disease> band keratopathy <END> occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respectively .
We used <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> or <START:Chemical> hydroxychloroquine <END> in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of <START:Disease> chorioretinopathy <END> attributable to these drugs .
Systemically administered <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular <START:Disease> cataracts <END> was found .
Typical <START:Disease> keratoconjunctivitis <END> sicca developed in three of the <START:Disease> uveitis <END> cases .
This association with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> and JRA was not noted previously .
Surgical treatment of <START:Disease> cataracts <END> , <START:Disease> band keratopathy <END> , and <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> achieved uniformly discouraging results .
Receptor mechanisms of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> in chronic <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - treated rats .
Rats were pretreated with saline or <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg per day ) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini - pump which continuously released saline or <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 1 , 5 and 14 days .
At the end of each pretreatment period , animals were used for ( i ) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> ( 0 . 2 mg / kg , s . c . ) and ( ii ) measuring the density of L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> and [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding sites in the striatum .
We observed no changes in <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced locomotor response , striatal L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> and [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding in the animals pretreated with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 1 day .
In rats which were pretreated with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 5 days , there was a significant increase in the <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> binding sites and also with an elevated <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) level in the striatum .
The number of striatal [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding sites was not affected .
In animals pretreated with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 14 days , the <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated .
However , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding sites , whereas the number of striatal L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> binding sites and the striatal <START:Chemical> DA <END> level were normal .
These results suggest that chronic <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - treated rats develop <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> in response to <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and <START:Chemical> DA <END> concentration , followed by inducing <START:Chemical> DA <END> receptor supersensitivity in the striatum .
Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 , E 2 , or F 2 alpha <END> to conscious mice .
The effects of intrathecal administration of <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> on <START:Disease> pain <END> responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and <START:Chemical> acetic acid <END> writhing tests .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin D 2 <END> ( 0 . 5 - 3 ng / mouse ) had a <START:Disease> hyperalgesic <END> action on the response to a hot plate during a 3 - 60 min period after injection .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin E 2 <END> showed a <START:Disease> hyperalgesic <END> effect at doses of 1 <START:Chemical> pg <END> to 10 ng / mouse , but the effect lasted shorter ( 3 - 30 min ) than that of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 <END> .
Similar results were obtained by <START:Chemical> acetic acid <END> writhing tests .
The <START:Disease> hyperalgesic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 <END> was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist ( greater than or equal to 100 ng ) but not by <START:Chemical> AH 6809 <END> , a prostanoid EP 1 - receptor antagonist .
Conversely , <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> was blocked by <START:Chemical> AH 6809 <END> ( greater than or equal to 500 ng ) but not by the substance P antagonist .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin F 2 alpha <END> had little effect on <START:Disease> pain <END> responses .
These results demonstrate that both <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 2 <END> exert <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> in the spinal cord , but in different ways .
<START:Chemical> Valproic acid <END> I : time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers , <START:Disease> liver toxicity <END> , and <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> metabolite levels in rats .
A single dose of <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) , which is a widely used antiepileptic drug , is associated with oxidative stress in rats , as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - isoprostane <END> ( <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> ) .
To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - associated oxidative stress and <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , adult male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated ip with <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ( 500 mg / kg ) or 0 . 9 % saline ( vehicle ) once daily for 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , or 14 days .
Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> , <START:Chemical> lipid hydroperoxides <END> ( <START:Chemical> LPO <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> thiobarbituric acid reactive substances <END> ( <START:Chemical> TBARs <END> ) .
Plasma and liver <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> treatment compared to control .
Liver <START:Chemical> LPO <END> levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment ( 1 . 8 - fold versus control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
Liver and plasma <START:Chemical> TBARs <END> were not increased until 14 days ( 2 - fold vs . control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Disease> Liver toxicity <END> was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha - <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> S - transferase ( alpha - GST ) and by histology .
Serum alpha - GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4 , which corresponded to <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> as shown by the increasing incidence of <START:Disease> inflammation <END> of the liver capsule , <START:Disease> necrosis <END> , and <START:Disease> steatosis <END> throughout the study .
The liver levels of beta - oxidation metabolites of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> were decreased by day 14 , while the levels of <START:Chemical> 4 - ene - VPA <END> and ( E ) - <START:Chemical> 2 , 4 - diene - VPA <END> were not elevated throughout the study .
Overall , these findings indicate that <START:Chemical> VPA <END> treatment results in oxidative stress , as measured by levels of <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> , which precedes the onset of <START:Disease> necrosis <END> , <START:Disease> steatosis <END> , and elevated levels of serum alpha - GST .
Fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> due to <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> -- lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro .
Although <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> has been implicated as a possible cause of <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> on the basis of a few clinical observations , its role has not been definitely established .
A case of fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> is described in which no drugs other than <START:Chemical> allopurinol <END> and <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> were given .
<START:Chemical> Indomethacin <END> was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms .
A positive lymphocyte transformation test with <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> in a susceptible patient .
Fortunately , this seems to be a very rare complication .
Possible intramuscular <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> - associated <START:Disease> cardiorespiratory arrest <END> and <START:Disease> death <END> .
<START:Chemical> Midazolam hydrochloride <END> is commonly used for dental or endoscopic procedures .
Although generally consisted safe when given intramuscularly , intravenous administration is known to cause <START:Disease> respiratory and cardiovascular depression <END> .
This report describes the first published case of <START:Disease> cardiorespiratory arrest <END> and <START:Disease> death <END> associated with intramuscular administration of <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> .
Information regarding <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> use is reviewed to provide recommendation for safe administration .
Effect of <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> on <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats .
Effect of methanolic extract of <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> ( 100 - 300 mg / kg ) was studied on <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced orofacial <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> and neurochemical alterations .
The rats were treated with intraperitoneal <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg , ip ) for 3 days every other day .
On day 5 , vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however , coadministration of <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> roots extract ( 100 , 200 and 300 mg / kg , per orally ) attenuated the effects .
Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> reductase ( GSH ) , an index of oxidative stress process .
Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD , CAT and GSH levels .
The results of the present study suggested that <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> had a protective role against <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced orofacial <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> and oxidative stress .
<START:Chemical> Ketanserin <END> pretreatment reverses <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
Systemic pretreatment with <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> , a relatively specific type - 2 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> receptor antagonist , significantly attenuated the <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> produced in rats by the potent short - acting opiate agonist <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> .
Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal ' s left gastrocnemius muscle , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> was assessed by analyzing root - mean - square electromyographic activity .
Intraperitoneal <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> administration at doses of 0 . 63 and 2 . 5 mg / kg prevented the <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline .
<START:Chemical> Chlordiazepoxide <END> at doses up to 10 mg / kg failed to significantly influence the <START:Disease> rigidity <END> produced by <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> .
Despite the absence of <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , animals that received <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> ( greater than 0 . 31 mg / kg i . p . ) followed by <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> were motionless , flaccid , and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> alone .
Rats that received <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> and <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60 - min recording period than did animals that received <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> alone .
These results , in combination with previous work , suggest that <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> , a clinically relevant side - effect of parenteral narcotic administration , may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways .
Pretreatment with type - 2 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate - induced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS , <START:Disease> cardiovascular , and respiratory depression <END> .
Mechanisms of <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> : comparison with exercise - induced <START:Disease> ischemia <END> .
The role of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> in eliciting <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> was examined in patients with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
Objective signs of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> and factors increasing myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption were compared during <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> infusion and supine bicycle exercise .
Both <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> and exercise produced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> as evidenced by ST segment <START:Disease> depression <END> and <START:Disease> angina <END> .
However , the mechanisms of <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> were significantly different from those of exercise .
Exercise - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate - pressure product with a minor contribution of end - diastolic volume , while <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> ischemia <END> was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate - pressure product .
These findings indicate that <START:Disease> ischemia <END> produced by <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .
Effect of intravenous <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> on blood pressure and outcome after <START:Disease> acute stroke <END> .
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The Intravenous <START:Chemical> Nimodipine <END> West European <START:Disease> Stroke <END> Trial ( INWEST ) found a correlation between <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> - induced <START:Disease> reduction in blood pressure <END> ( BP ) and an unfavorable outcome in <START:Disease> acute stroke <END> .
We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of <START:Disease> BP reduction <END> .
METHODS : Patients with a clinical diagnosis of <START:Disease> ischemic stroke <END> ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100 ) , 1 mg / h ( low - dose ) <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> ( n = 101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high - dose ) <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> ( n = 94 ) .
The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed .
RESULTS : Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose , respectively ) .
<START:Chemical> Nimodipine <END> treatment resulted in a statistically significant <START:Disease> reduction in systolic BP <END> ( SBP ) and diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days .
In multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between <START:Disease> DBP reduction <END> and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0 . 49 , P = 0 . 048 ) .
Patients with a <START:Disease> DBP reduction <END> of > or = 20 % in the high - dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable <START:Disease> death <END> or dependency ( Barthel Index < 60 ) ( n / N = 25 / 26 , OR 10 . 16 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 to 101 . 74 ) and <START:Disease> death <END> alone ( n / N = 9 / 26 , OR 4 . 336 , 95 % CI 1 . 131 16 . 619 ) compared with all placebo patients ( n / N = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) .
There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome .
CONCLUSIONS : DBP , but not SBP , reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> after <START:Disease> acute stroke <END> .
For low - dose <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> , the results were not conclusive .
These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> .
<START:Disease> Cerebral hemorrhage <END> associated with <START:Chemical> phenylpropanolamine <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including <START:Disease> stroke <END> .
It is often combined with <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in diet preparations and " look - alike " pills .
In order to determine if <START:Chemical> PPA <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> can lead to <START:Disease> stroke <END> in normotensive and / or <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats , we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days .
<START:Disease> Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage <END> was noted in 18 % of the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
A single <START:Chemical> PPA <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> administration ( same dose ) lead to acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in both the normotensive and <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> animals .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> PPA <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> can lead to <START:Disease> cerebral hemorrhage <END> in previously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage .
An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor .
<START:Disease> Granulomatous hepatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid <END> .
We report the case of a patient with <START:Chemical> amoxicillin - clavulanic acid <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> with histologic multiple <START:Disease> granulomas <END> .
This type of lesion broadens the spectrum of <START:Disease> liver injury <END> due to this drug combination , mainly represented by a benign <START:Disease> cholestatic syndrome <END> .
The association of <START:Disease> granulomas <END> and <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> favor an immunoallergic mechanism .
As <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> derivatives and <START:Chemical> amoxicillin <END> alone are known to induce such types of lesions , the <START:Chemical> amoxicillin <END> component , with or without a potentiating effect of <START:Chemical> clavulanic acid <END> , might have a major role .
Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies in patients with <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> - associated mental <START:Disease> confusion <END> .
15 cases of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> - associated mental <START:Disease> confusion <END> have been reported .
In order that this syndrome might be investigated changes in mental status ( M . S . ) were correlated with serum concentrations and renal and hepatic function in 36 patients , 30 patients had no M . S . change on <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> and 6 had moderate to severe changes .
These 6 patients had both <START:Disease> renal and liver dysfunction <END> ( P less than 0 . 05 ) , as well as <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> trough - concentrations of more than 1 . 25 microgram / ml ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
The severity of M . S . changes increased as trough - concentrations rose , 5 patients had lumbar puncture .
The cerebrospinal fluid : serum ratio of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> concentrations was 0 . 24 : 1 and indicates that <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> passes the blood - brain barrier ; it also raises the possibility that M . S . changes are due to blockade of <START:Chemical> histamine <END> H 2 - receptors in the central nervous system .
Patients likely to have both raised trough - concentrations and mental <START:Disease> confusion <END> are those with both severe <START:Disease> renal and hepatic dysfunction <END> .
They should be closely observed and should be given reduced doses of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
The safety and efficacy of combination <START:Chemical> N - butyl - deoxynojirimycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> ) and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> in patients with <START:Disease> HIV - 1 infection <END> and 200 - 500 CD 4 cells / mm 3 .
We conducted a double - blind , randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with <START:Chemical> N - butyl - deoxynojirimycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> ) ( an alpha - glucosidase I inhibitor ) and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> versus <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> alone .
Patients with 200 to 500 CD 4 cells / mm 3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> therapy received <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> ( 1000 mg every 8 h ) and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( 100 mg every 8 h ) or <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> and placebo .
Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58 , <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> and placebo .
Twenty - three patients ( 38 % ) and 15 ( 26 % ) , in the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups , respectively , discontinued therapy ( p = 0 . 15 ) .
The mean <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> steady - state trough level ( 4 . 04 + / - 0 . 99 micrograms / ml ) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> virus ( HIV ) .
The mean increase in CD 4 cells at week 4 was 73 . 8 cells / mm 3 and 52 . 4 cells / mm 3 for the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups , respectively ( p > 0 . 36 ) .
For patients with prior <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> therapy , the mean change in CD 4 cells in the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups was 63 . 7 cells / mm 3 and 4 . 9 cells / mm 3 at week 8 and 6 . 8 cells / mm 3 and - 45 . 1 cells / mm 3 at week 16 , respectively .
The number of patients with suppression of HIV p 24 antigenemia in the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups was six ( 40 % ) and two ( 11 % ) at week 4 ( p = 0 . 10 ) and five ( 45 % ) and two ( 14 % ) at week 24 ( p = 0 . 08 ) , respectively .
<START:Disease> Diarrhea <END> , <START:Disease> flatulence <END> , <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , and <START:Disease> weight loss <END> were common for combination recipients . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Anthracyclines <END> are effective antineoplastic drugs , but they frequently cause dose - related <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> of conventional <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> .
We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> in patients with <START:Disease> acute leukemia <END> treated with a <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DNR <END> ) - containing regimen .
Thirteen patients with <START:Disease> acute leukemia <END> were treated with a <START:Chemical> DNR <END> - containing regimen .
Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies .
The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( ANP ) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography .
Three patients developed <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> after the completion of chemotherapy .
Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical <START:Disease> heart failure <END> after the completion of chemotherapy .
The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical <START:Disease> heart failure <END> increased above the normal limit ( 40 pg / ml ) before the detection of clinical or subclinical <START:Disease> heart failure <END> by radionuclide angiography .
On the other hand , BNP did not increase in the patients without <START:Disease> heart failure <END> given <START:Chemical> DNR <END> , even at more than 700 mg / m ( 2 ) .
The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> confusion <END> induced by a high - dose infusion of <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> .
A 61 - year - old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating <START:Chemical> cisplatinum <END> , <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , high - dose <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> ( 2 , 250 mg / m 2 / 24 hours ) and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> for an inoperable <START:Disease> gastric adenocarcinoma <END> .
He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental <START:Disease> confusion <END> , <START:Disease> disorientation <END> and <START:Disease> irritability <END> , and then lapsed into a deep <START:Disease> coma <END> , lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose ( day 2 ) of <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> infusion .
This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> , which were then the only drugs given .
Because <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> was unlikely to be associated with this condition , <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> due to high - dose <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> was highly suspected .
The pathogenesis of <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by <START:Chemical> fluoroacetate <END> and <START:Chemical> fluorocitrate <END> , <START:Chemical> thiamine <END> deficiency , or <START:Chemical> dihydrouracil <END> dehydrogenase deficiency .
High - dose <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> / <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various <START:Disease> cancers <END> .
It is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication .
Differential diagnosis of high serum <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase levels in <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57 - year - old woman with severe <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
Since 1989 , she had been suffering from <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:Disease> SLE <END> ) with <START:Disease> renal involvement <END> and undergone periods of treatment with <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> .
Additional therapy with <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CQ <END> ) was started because of <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> .
At the same time , slightly increased <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase ( CK ) levels were noted .
<START:Disease> Myositis <END> was suspected , and the patient was treated with <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
The CK increase persisted , however , and she developed progressive <START:Disease> muscular weakness <END> and <START:Disease> muscular atrophy <END> .
Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1 , 700 U / l .
The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of <START:Disease> myositis <END> .
Thus , muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> or toxic <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
As it revealed <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , medication was stopped .
Discriminating between primary <START:Disease> SLE <END> - induced <START:Disease> affection of the musculoskeletal system <END> and drug - induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of <START:Disease> SLE <END> patients .
Effects of the novel compound <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> ( <START:Chemical> Ro 13 - 5057 <END> ) upon <START:Disease> impaired learning and memory <END> in rodents .
The effect of <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> ( <START:Chemical> Ro 13 - 5057 <END> , <START:Chemical> 1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone <END> ) was studied on various forms of experimentally <START:Disease> impaired cognitive functions <END> ( learning and memory ) in rodents and produced the following effects : ( 1 ) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal <START:Disease> hypercapnia <END> immediately before the acquisition session ; ( 2 ) partial ( rats ) or complete ( mice ) prevention of the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced short - term <START:Disease> amnesia <END> for a passive avoidance task ; ( 3 ) complete protection against <START:Disease> amnesia <END> for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition ; ( 4 ) prevention of the long - term retention - or retrieval - deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> or <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> administered immediately after acquisition ; ( 5 ) reversal , when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test , of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> injected 2 days previously ; ( 6 ) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or <START:Disease> hypercapnia <END> applied immediately before retrieval testing ( 24 h after acquisition ) .
These improvements or normalizations of <START:Disease> impaired cognitive functions <END> were seen at oral <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> doses of 10 - 100 mg / kg .
Generally , the dose - response curves were bell - shaped .
The mechanisms underlying the activity of <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> and its ' therapeutic window ' are unknown .
<START:Chemical> Piracetam <END> , another <START:Chemical> pyrrolidinone <END> derivative was used for comparison .
It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one - tenth the potency of <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> .
The results indicate that <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process .
<START:Chemical> Fluconazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To present a case of <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> - associated <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> ( <START:Disease> TDP <END> ) and discuss <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> ' s role in causing <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 68 - year - old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed <START:Disease> TDP <END> eight days after commencing oral <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> The patient had no other risk factors for <START:Disease> TDP <END> , including <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> , and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> and <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
The <START:Disease> TDP <END> resolved when <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> was discontinued ; however , the patient continued to have <START:Disease> premature ventricular contractions <END> and nonsustained <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( <START:Disease> NSVT <END> ) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION : Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> and the development of <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
The possible mechanism is <START:Disease> depression <END> of rapidly activating delayed rectifier <START:Chemical> potassium <END> currents .
In our patient , there was no other etiology identified that could explain <START:Disease> QT prolongation <END> or <START:Disease> TDP <END> The complete disappearance of <START:Disease> NSVT <END> and <START:Disease> premature ventricular contractions <END> followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> as the etiology .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware that <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> , even at low doses , may cause <START:Disease> prolongation of the QT interval <END> , leading to <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> is administered in patients who are at risk for <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypomania <END> - like syndrome induced by <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> .
We report a female patient with a diagnosis of a not otherwise specified <START:Disease> psychotic disorder <END> ( DSM - IV ) who developed <START:Disease> hypomania <END> shortly after the introduction of <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> treatment .
Effect of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> on hepatic and brain cytochrome P 450 s and influence of P 450 modulation in <START:Chemical> lindane <END> induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> ( 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 and 15 mg / kg , body weight ) for 5 days was found to produce a dose - dependent increase in the activity of P 450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD ) , 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD ) and <START:Chemical> N - nitrosodimethylamine <END> demethylase ( <START:Chemical> NDMA <END> - d ) in rat brain and liver .
A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P 450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days .
As observed with different doses , the magnitude of induction in the activity of P 450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain .
Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P 450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P 450 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 , 2 B 1 / 2 B 2 and 2 E 1 isoenzymes .
In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P 450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD , EROD and <START:Chemical> NDMA <END> - d are due to the increase in the levels of P 450 2 B 1 / 2 B 2 , 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 and 2 E 1 isoenzymes , respectively .
Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of <START:Chemical> 3 - methylcholanthrene <END> ( <START:Chemical> MC <END> ) , an inducer of P 4501 A 1 / 1 A 2 , did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> , pretreatment with <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> ( PB ) , an inducer of P 450 2 B 1 / 2 B 2 or <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> , an inducer of P 450 2 E 1 catalysed reactions , significantly increased the incidence of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Similarly , when the P 450 - mediated metabolism of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> was blocked by <START:Chemical> cobalt chloride <END> incidence of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> was increased in animals treated with <START:Chemical> lindane <END> indicating that <START:Chemical> lindane <END> per se or its metabolites formed by PB or <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> inducible P 450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> PTU <END> - associated <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> in a girl with <START:Disease> Turner Syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> Graves ' disease <END> .
Palpable <START:Disease> purpura <END> is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes , including infectious and autoimmune processes .
A rare cause , drug - induced <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> , may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCAs ) in response to a medication .
We report a girl with <START:Disease> Turner syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> Graves ' disease <END> who presented with palpable <START:Disease> purpuric lesions <END> .
The diagnosis of <START:Chemical> propylthiouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTU <END> ) - associated <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> was made by observation of consistent clinical features , the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood , and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of <START:Chemical> PTU <END> .
Subsequent treatment of persistent <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> , a complication described in prior case reports .
Chronic <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> inhibits the development of local anesthetic <START:Disease> seizures <END> kindled by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> ) treatment on local anesthetic - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> administration .
Chronic oral <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> inhibited the development of both <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Chronic <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> also decreased the incidence of <START:Disease> seizure <END> - related mortality in the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - injected rats .
Acute <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> over a range of doses ( 15 - 50 mg / kg ) had no effect on completed <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - kindled or acute <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Repeated i . p . injection of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> ( 15 mg / kg ) also was without effect on the development of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - or <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The differential effects of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> depending upon stage of <START:Disease> seizure <END> development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated , intermittent injections of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens .
The possible utility of chronic <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> users is suggested by these data , but remains to be directly evaluated .
Acute <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> : differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains .
Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by a single injection of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> was injected ip over a range of doses ( 50 - 100 mg / kg ) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus , latency to clonic running <START:Disease> seizure <END> and latency to jumping bouncing <START:Disease> seizure <END> .
A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A / J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C 57 BL / 6 J most resistant .
DBA / 2 J , BALB / cByJ and NZW / LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity .
EEG recordings were made in SJL , A / J and C 57 BL / 6 J mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior .
Additionally , levels of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains .
Additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Higher optical density of an antigen assay predicts <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> in patients with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To correlate optical density and percent inhibition of a two - step <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ( <START:Disease> HIT <END> ) antigen assay with <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> ; the assay utilizes reaction inhibition characteristics of a high <START:Chemical> heparin <END> concentration .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients with more than 50 % decrease in platelet count or <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ( < 150 x 10 ( 9 ) / L ) after exposure to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , who had a positive two - step antigen assay [ optical density ( OD ) > 0 . 4 and > 50 inhibition with high concentration of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> ] were included in the study .
RESULTS : Forty of 94 <START:Disease> HIT <END> patients had <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> at diagnosis ; 54 / 94 had isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> without <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
Eight of the isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> patients developed <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> within the next 30 d ; thus , a total of 48 patients had <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> at day 30 .
At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between <START:Disease> HIT <END> patients with <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> and those with isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> .
However , OD was significantly higher in all patients with <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> ( n = 48 , 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 89 ) , including isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> patients who later developed <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> within 30 d ( n = 8 , 1 . 84 + / - 0 . 64 ) as compared to isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> patients who did not develop <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> ( 0 . 96 + / - 0 . 75 ; P = 0 . 011 and P = 0 . 008 ) .
The Receiver Operative Characteristic Curve showed that OD > 1 . 27 in the isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> group had a significantly higher chance of developing <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> by day 30 .
None of these groups showed significant difference in percent inhibition .
Multivariate analysis showed a 2 . 8 - fold increased risk of <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> in females .
Similarly , <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> risk increased with age and OD values .
CONCLUSION : Higher OD is associated with significant risk of subsequent <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> in patients with isolated - <START:Disease> HIT <END> ; percent inhibition , however , was not predictive .
Reversibility of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> after prolonged use in an unusual case of <START:Disease> renovascular hypertension <END> .
We report a case of severe <START:Disease> hypertension <END> with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney , who developed <START:Disease> sudden deterioration of renal function <END> following treatment with <START:Chemical> captopril <END> .
His renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years ' treatment with <START:Chemical> captopril <END> but returned to pre - treatment levels soon after cessation of the drug .
This indicates reversibility in <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal failure <END> even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ACE inhibition .
Mutations associated with <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - resistance in therapy - <START:Chemical> na <END> ve <START:Disease> hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infected <END> patients with and without <START:Disease> HIV co - infection <END> : implications for antiretroviral therapy in <START:Disease> HBV and HIV co - infected <END> South African patients .
This was an exploratory study to investigate <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - resistant <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> virus ( HBV ) strains in selected <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - <START:Chemical> na <END> ve HBV carriers with and without <START:Disease> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) co - infection <END> in South African patients .
Thirty - five <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - <START:Chemical> na <END> ve <START:Disease> HBV infected <END> patients with or without <START:Disease> HIV co - infection <END> were studied : 15 chronic <START:Disease> HBV mono - infected <END> patients and 20 <START:Disease> HBV - HIV co - infected <END> patients .
The latter group was further sub - divided into 13 occult HBV ( <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> - negative ) and 7 overt HBV ( <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> - positive ) patients .
<START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> , anti - HBs , anti - HBc , and anti - HIV 1 / 2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays ( Abbott Laboratories , North Chicago , IL ) .
Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase ( RT ) primers , followed by direct sequencing across the <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> - <START:Chemical> methionine <END> - <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> - <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> ( YMDD ) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme .
HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v 2 . 0 ( Roche Diagnostics , Penzberg , Germany ) .
HBV <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono - infected chronic <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> patients and 10 of 20 <START:Disease> HBV - HIV co - infected <END> patients .
To the best of our knowledge , this constitutes the first report of HBV <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - resistant strains in therapy - <START:Chemical> na <END> ve <START:Disease> HBV - HIV co - infected <END> patients .
The HBV viral loads for mono - infected and co - infected patients ranged from 3 . 32 x 10 ( 2 ) to 3 . 82 x 10 ( 7 ) and < 200 to 4 . 40 x 10 ( 3 ) copies / ml , respectively .
It remains to be seen whether such pre - existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> - containing highly active antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment ( HAART ) regimens become widely applied in South Africa , as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of <START:Disease> HBV - HIV co - infected <END> patients .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> : filling the bench - to - bedside gap .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> is the most effective drug for the treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
However , the long - term use of this <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , their pathogenesis is still unclear .
In recent years , evidence from animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post - receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of <START:Disease> dyskinetic movements <END> .
Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms , <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor subtypes , ionotropic and metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptors , and non - dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Reduction of <START:Chemical> heparan sulphate <END> - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Heparan sulphate <END> - associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of <START:Disease> diabetes <END> by <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> and in age - adn sex - matched control rats , employing the cationic dye <START:Chemical> cuprolinic blue <END> .
Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor .
The <START:Chemical> heparan sulphate <END> specificity of the <START:Chemical> cuprolinic blue <END> staining was demonstrated by <START:Chemical> glycosaminoglycan <END> - degrading enzymes , showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining , whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect .
The majority of anionic sites ( 74 % in <START:Disease> diabetic <END> and 81 % in control rats ) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane .
A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna , and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane ( p < 0 . 001 and p < 0 . 01 for <START:Disease> diabetic <END> and control rats , respectively ) .
<START:Disease> Diabetic <END> rats progressively developed <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> reaching 40 . 3 ( 32 . 2 - 62 . 0 ) mg / 24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals ( 0 . 8 ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 9 ) mg / 24 h , p < 0 . 002 ) .
At the same time , the number of <START:Chemical> heparan sulphate <END> anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface ) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19 % ( p < 0 . 021 ) and by 26 % ( p < 0 . 02 ) , respectively .
Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane ( lamina densa and lamina rara interna ) were not significantly changed .
We conclude that in <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion , a reduced <START:Chemical> heparan sulphate <END> charge barrier / density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane .
<START:Disease> Acute liver failure <END> with concurrent <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> therapy .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of fatal <START:Disease> liver failure <END> possibly associated with concurrent use of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 41 - year - old Chinese man with a history of <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> had been treated with <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> for the past 5 years .
He received a 10 - day course of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation .
He developed <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> with rapid deterioration of renal function .
Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific <START:Disease> drug - induced acute liver injury <END> .
His condition was further complicated by <START:Disease> sepsis <END> and <START:Disease> coagulopathy <END> .
Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms .
The likelihood that <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> induced <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in our patient was possible , based on the Naranjo probability scale .
DISCUSSION : Although there is increasing evidence of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> , this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> in a patient receiving <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> while on concomitant treatment with <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of <START:Disease> acute liver insult <END> induced by <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> given concurrently with other <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> drugs .
Multicenter , double - blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups efficacy and safety trial of <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> , <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine <END> , and placebo in the treatment of <START:Disease> spring allergic rhinitis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Azelastine <END> , a novel antiallergic medication , was compared with <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine maleate <END> and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of <START:Disease> spring allergic rhinitis <END> in a multicenter , double - blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups study .
One hundred fifty - five subjects participated .
Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2 - year history of <START:Disease> spring allergic rhinitis <END> , confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens .
Medications were given four times daily ; the <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> groups received 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , or 2 . 0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon ; the <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine <END> group received 4 . 0 mg four times daily .
Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4 - week treatment period while subjects received study medications .
Individual symptoms , total symptoms , and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication .
Elicited , volunteered , and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups .
Vital signs , body weights , serum chemistry values , complete blood cell counts , urine studies , and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups .
Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> ( 2 . 0 mg twice daily ) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study .
Lower doses of <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study .
In contrast , although the <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine <END> group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study , the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study .
There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups .
<START:Disease> Drowsiness <END> and <START:Disease> altered taste perception <END> were increased significantly over placebo only in the high - dose <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> group .
<START:Chemical> Azelastine <END> appears to be a safe , efficacious medication for <START:Disease> seasonal allergic rhinitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Urinary bladder cancer <END> in <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> : risks and relation to <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To assess and characterise the risk of <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> , and its relation to <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> , in patients with <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> .
METHODS : In the population based , nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> , 1969 - 95 , was identified .
Through linkage with the Swedish <START:Disease> Cancer <END> Register , all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> were identified .
Nested within the cohort , a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> and <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> using odds ratios ( ORs ) as relative risk .
In the cohort the cumulative risk of <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> after <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> , and the relative prevalence of a history of <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> at the time of diagnosis of <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> , were also estimated .
RESULTS : The median cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> among cases ( n = 11 ) and controls ( n = 25 ) were 113 g and 25 g , respectively .
The risk of <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> doubled for every 10 g increment in <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( OR = 2 . 0 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0 . 8 to 4 . 9 ) .
Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk ( OR = 7 . 7 , 95 % CI 0 . 9 to 69 ) .
The absolute risk for <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> in the cohort reached 10 % 16 years after diagnosis of <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> , and a history of <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> was ( non - significantly ) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> .
CONCLUSION : The results indicate a dose - response relationship between <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> and the risk of <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> , high cumulative risks in the entire cohort , and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before <START:Disease> Wegener ' s granulomatosis <END> .
<START:Disease> Hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> in terminal <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients treated with continuous intravenous <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Eight <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous <START:Chemical> morphine <END> developed <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen .
Five patients developed universal <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> hyperesthesia <END> which in 2 cases were accompanied by <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> .
In 3 patients a pre - existing <START:Disease> neuralgia <END> increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> occurred simultaneously .
Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> / <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> and high doses of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> are available , experimental support from animal studies indicates that <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , or its metabolites , plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome .
The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations .
Initial <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss and <START:Disease> hypokalaemia <END> during <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> administration in patients with essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> : the influence of dietary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> restriction .
To investigate the initial <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss and development of <START:Disease> hypokalaemia <END> during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> who had shown <START:Disease> hypokalaemia <END> under prior oral diuretic treatment .
<START:Chemical> Chlorthalidone <END> ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 days .
Six patients received a normal - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> diet and four a low - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> ( 17 mmol / day ) diet .
All patients had a normal initial total body <START:Chemical> potassium <END> ( 40 K ) .
The electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> secretion rate were measured .
In both groups a <START:Chemical> potassium <END> deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment .
In the normal - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group the highest mean <START:Chemical> potassium <END> deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some <START:Chemical> potassium <END> was regained ; in the low - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13 .
The normal - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> levels ; in the low - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group renin and <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> increased more slowly but remained elevated .
It is concluded that dietary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> restriction increases diuretic - induced <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> system , while <START:Chemical> sodium <END> delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased <START:Chemical> potassium <END> secretion .
Pseudo - <START:Disease> allergic reactions <END> to <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> : diagnosis and alternatives .
Two patients treated with parenteral <START:Chemical> paramethasone <END> ( Triniol ) and <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> ( Sedionbel ) are described .
A few minutes after administration of the drugs , they presented <START:Disease> urticaria <END> ( patients 1 and 2 ) and <START:Disease> conjunctivitis <END> ( patient 1 ) .
The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients ' reactions , the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid .
Clinical examinations and skin , oral and parenteral challenges with different <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> and ELISA tests were performed .
In the two patients , skin and ELISA tests with <START:Chemical> paramethasone <END> were negative , as was the prick test with each of its excipients .
A single - blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug , and negative with its excipients .
We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> and found intolerance to some of them .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> paramethasone <END> caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients .
Corticosteroids different from <START:Chemical> paramethasone <END> also produced <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> reactions in these patients ; however , a few of them were tolerated .
The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood .
To our knowledge , this is the first report of a pseudo - <START:Disease> allergy <END> caused by <START:Chemical> paramethasone <END> .
The role of nitrergic system in <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsion <END> in the mouse .
The effects of <START:Chemical> N - nitro - L - arginine - methyl ester <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ) a <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) synthase inhibitor and <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> , a <START:Chemical> NO <END> precursor , were investigated on <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
In the first experiment , four groups of mice received physiological saline ( 0 . 9 % ) , <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> ( 300 mg / kg , i . p . ) , <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 2 mg / kg ) , respectively .
Thirty minutes after these injections , all mice received <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
In the second experiment , four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment , and 30 min after these injections , all mice received a higher dose of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 80 mg / kg ) .
<START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 2 mg / kg ) significantly decreased the incidence of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 50 mg / kg ) - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
In contrast , the <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> treatment increased the incidence of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 80 mg / kg , i . p . ) - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> significantly .
These results may suggest that <START:Chemical> NO <END> is a proconvulsant mediator in <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Prevention of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> : preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women .
Italian <START:Chemical> Tamoxifen <END> Prevention Study .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Tamoxifen <END> is a candidate chemopreventive agent in <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , although the drug may be associated with the development of <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> .
Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> as a chemopreventive .
METHODS : In October , 1992 , we started a double - blind placebo - controlled , randomised trial of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> in women ( mainly in Italy ) who did not have <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> and who had had a hysterectomy .
Women were randomised to receive <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> 20 mg per day or placebo , both orally for 5 years .
The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up .
In June , 1997 , the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study .
Recruitment ended on July 11 , 1997 , and the study will continue as planned .
The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat .
FINDINGS : 5408 women were randomised ; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints .
41 cases of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> occurred so far ; there have been no deaths from <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
There is no difference in <START:Disease> breast - cancer <END> frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases ) and <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> ( 19 ) arms .
There is a statistically significant reduction of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> among women receiving <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial : among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo , we found eight cases of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> compared with one case among 362 women allocated to <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
Compared with the placebo group , there was a significantly increased risk of <START:Disease> vascular events <END> and <START:Disease> hypertriglyceridaemia <END> among women on <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
INTERPRETATION : Although this preliminary analysis has low power , in this cohort of women at low - to - normal risk of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , the postulated protective effects of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> are not yet apparent .
Women using hormone - replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
There were no deaths from <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> recorded in women in the study .
It is essential to continue follow - up to quantify the long - term risks and benefits of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> therapy .
Cortical motor overactivation in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients with <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> - induced peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) changes induced by the execution of a finger - to - thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients on <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> medication , the first one without <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> ( n = 23 ) and the other with moderate peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> ( n = 15 ) , and of a group of 14 normal subjects .
Single photon emission tomography with i . v . 133 Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes .
The <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non - <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients , with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi - and contralateral primary motor areas .
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an <START:Disease> hyperkinetic <END> <START:Disease> abnormal involuntary movement <END> , like <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> - induced peak dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> , is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop .
<START:Chemical> Organophosphate <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and prevention of <START:Disease> neuropathological damages <END> .
Such <START:Chemical> organophosphorus <END> ( <START:Chemical> OP <END> ) compounds as <START:Chemical> diisopropylfluorophosphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFP <END> ) , <START:Chemical> sarin <END> and <START:Chemical> soman <END> are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases ( AChEs ) and butyrylcholinesterases ( BChEs ) .
The acute <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> OPs <END> is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , which elevates <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ACh <END> ) levels .
The protective action of subcutaneously ( SC ) administered antidotes or their combinations in <START:Chemical> DFP <END> ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) intoxication was studied in 9 - 10 - weeks - old Han - Wistar male rats .
The rats received AChE reactivator <START:Chemical> pralidoxime - 2 - chloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> 2 PAM <END> ) ( 30 . 0 mg / kg BW ) , anticonvulsant <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) , A ( 1 ) - <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> receptor agonist <START:Chemical> N ( 6 ) - cyclopentyl adenosine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CPA <END> ) ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) , <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> - receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> dizocilpine maleate <END> ( + - MK 801 hydrogen maleate ) ( 2 . 0 mg / kg BW ) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug <START:Chemical> atropine sulfate <END> ( 50 . 0 mg / kg BW ) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of <START:Chemical> DFP <END> .
The control rats received <START:Chemical> atropine sulfate <END> , but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and <START:Chemical> DFP <END> , respectively .
All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the <START:Chemical> DFP <END> injection .
The rats treated with <START:Chemical> DFP <END> - <START:Chemical> atropine <END> showed severe typical <START:Chemical> OP <END> - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> signs .
When <START:Chemical> CPA <END> , <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> or <START:Chemical> 2 PAM <END> was given immediately after <START:Chemical> DFP <END> - <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , these treatments prevented , delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of <START:Disease> poisoning <END> .
<START:Chemical> Atropine <END> - <START:Chemical> MK 801 <END> did not offer any additional protection against <START:Chemical> DFP <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
In conclusion , <START:Chemical> CPA <END> , <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> and <START:Chemical> 2 PAM <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> atropine <END> prevented the occurrence of serious signs of <START:Disease> poisoning <END> and thus reduced the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> DFP <END> in rat .
Pharmacokinetics of <START:Chemical> desipramine HCl <END> when administered with <START:Chemical> cinacalcet HCl <END> .
OBJECTIVE : In vitro work has demonstrated that <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 isoenzyme ( CYP ) 2 D 6 .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> on CYP 2 D 6 activity , using <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> as a probe substrate , in healthy subjects .
METHODS : Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP 2 D 6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized , open - label , crossover study to receive a single oral dose of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> ( 50 mg ) on two separate occasions , once alone and once after multiple doses of <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> ( 90 mg for 7 days ) .
Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose .
RESULTS : Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms .
Relative to <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> alone , mean AUC and C ( max ) of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> increased 3 . 6 - and 1 . 8 - fold when coadministered with <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> .
The t ( 1 / 2 , z ) of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> was longer when <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> was coadministered with <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> ( 21 . 0 versus 43 . 3 hs ) .
The t ( max ) was similar between the regimens .
Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> alone than when receiving <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> with <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> ( 33 versus 86 % ) , the most frequent of which ( <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> headache <END> ) have been reported for patients treated with either <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> or <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> .
CONCLUSION : This study demonstrates that <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> is a strong inhibitor of CYP 2 D 6 .
These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with <START:Chemical> cinacalcet <END> , dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP 2 D 6 .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> treatment ameliorates acute <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in mice .
The nephroprotective effect of <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> was investigated in mice with <START:Disease> acute renal injury <END> induced by a single i . p . injection of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> treatment ( 10 mg / kg / day , i . p . ) was applied for 6 consecutive days , starting 1 day before <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> administration .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> significantly reduced <START:Chemical> blood urea nitrogen <END> and serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels which were increased by <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms ( <START:Chemical> reduced glutathione <END> level and <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase activity ) , suppressed lipid peroxidation , decreased the elevations of <START:Disease> tumor <END> <START:Disease> necrosis <END> factor - alpha , <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> and <START:Chemical> platinum <END> ion concentration , and attenuated the reductions of <START:Chemical> selenium <END> and <START:Chemical> zinc <END> ions in renal tissue resulted from <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> administration .
Also , histopathological <START:Disease> renal tissue damage <END> mediated by <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> was ameliorated by <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> treatment .
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> significantly decreased the <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> - induced overexpression of inducible <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase , nuclear factor - kappaB , caspase - 3 and p 53 in renal tissue .
It was concluded that <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> commonly encountered in clinical practice .
Sequential observations of <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system : analysis of the mechanism of transformation from <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> to <START:Disease> anencephaly <END> .
<START:Disease> Anencephaly <END> has been suggested to develop from <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> ; however , there is little direct experimental evidence to support this , and the mechanism of transformation remains unclear .
We examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid - to late - gestation mouse embryos .
We observed the <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> induced by <START:Chemical> 5 - azacytidine <END> at embryonic day 13 . 5 ( E 13 . 5 ) , let the embryos develop exo utero until E 18 . 5 , and re - observed the same embryos at E 18 . 5 .
We confirmed several cases of transformation from <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> to <START:Disease> anencephaly <END> .
However , in many cases , the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period .
To analyze the transformation patterns , we classified the <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> by size and shape of the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> tissue into several types at E 13 . 5 and E 18 . 5 .
It was found that the transformation of <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> tissue was not simply size - dependent , and all cases of <START:Disease> anencephaly <END> at E 18 . 5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> tissue at E 13 . 5 .
Microscopic observation showed the configuration of <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> at E 13 . 5 , frequent <START:Disease> hemorrhaging <END> and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> head at E 15 . 5 , and multiple modes of reduction in the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> tissue at E 18 . 5 .
From observations of the vasculature , altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> head .
These findings suggest that overgrowth of the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels , subsequent peripheral <START:Disease> circulatory failure <END> and / or <START:Disease> hemorrhaging <END> in various parts of the <START:Disease> exencephalic <END> head , leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from <START:Disease> exencephaly <END> to <START:Disease> anencephaly <END> .
Induction by <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> of <START:Disease> bladder and liver tumours <END> in the rat .
Effects on hepatocyte fine structure .
Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0 . 5 % or 1 . 0 % <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> by weight for up to 18 months .
At the 1 . 0 % dosage level , 20 % of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver , a statistically significant incidence .
These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration , the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats .
<START:Disease> Papillomas <END> of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - treated groups , and three rats bore <START:Disease> bladder carcinomas <END> .
However , significant yields of <START:Disease> bladder tumours <END> were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males .
Additionally , 20 to 25 % of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - treated rats developed <START:Disease> hyperplasia <END> of the bladder epithelium , which was not coincident with the presence of <START:Disease> bladder calculi <END> .
A low yield of <START:Disease> tumours <END> at various other sites also arose following <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> feeding .
An electron microscope study of the livers of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known <START:Disease> hepatocarcinogens <END> .
Intracavitary chemotherapy ( <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> / <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> liquid crystalline cubic phases ) for recurrent <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> -- clinical observations .
Human malignant <START:Disease> brain tumors <END> have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy .
Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers , separating two congruent networks of water channels .
Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs , the gel - like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity .
For human <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> recurrences , the feasibility , safety , and short - term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study .
A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> multiforme underwent re - resection and received an intracavitary application of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> cubic phases in different dosages .
Six of the patients received more than 15 mg <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and suffered from moderate to severe <START:Disease> brain edema <END> , while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> .
In the latter group , <START:Disease> brain edema <END> was markedly reduced and dealt medically .
Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> using cubic phases is feasible and safe , yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study .
Urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with <START:Disease> overactive bladder <END> after <START:Chemical> tolterodine <END> treatment .
OBJECTIVES : To study the urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with <START:Disease> overactive bladder <END> ( <START:Disease> OAB <END> ) after <START:Chemical> tolterodine <END> treatment .
MATERIAL AND METHOD : Thirty women ( aged 30 - 77 years ) diagnosed as having <START:Disease> OAB <END> at the Gynecology Clinic , King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January to April 2004 were included in the present study .
<START:Chemical> Tolterodine <END> 2 mg , twice daily was given .
After 8 weeks treatment , changes in micturition diary variables and tolerability were determined .
Short form 36 ( SF 36 ) questionaires ( Thai version ) were given before and after 8 weeks of treatment .
RESULTS : At 8 weeks , all micturition per day decreased from 16 . 7 + / - 5 . 3 to 6 . 7 + / - 2 . 4 times per day .
The number of <START:Disease> nocturia <END> episodes decreased from 5 . 4 + / - 4 . 2 to 1 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 times per night .
The most common side effect was <START:Disease> dry month <END> in 5 cases ( 16 . 7 % ) with 2 cases reporting a moderate degree and 1 case with severe degree .
Only one case ( 3 . 3 % ) withdrew from the present study due to a severe <START:Disease> dry mouth <END> .
The SF - 36 scores changed significantly in the domains of physical functioning , role function emotional , social function and mental heath .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Tolterodine <END> was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
Sex differences in <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> antagonist enhancement of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> antihyperalgesia in a <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> model of persistent <START:Disease> pain <END> : comparisons to two models of <START:Disease> acute pain <END> .
In <START:Disease> acute pain <END> models , <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) antagonists enhance the antinociceptive effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> to a greater extent in males than females .
The purpose of this investigation was to extend these findings to a persistent <START:Disease> pain <END> model which could be distinguished from <START:Disease> acute pain <END> models on the basis of the nociceptive fibers activated , neurochemical substrates , and duration of the nociceptive stimulus .
To this end , persistent <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> was induced by administration of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> in the tail of gonadally intact F 344 rats , following which the tail was immersed in a mildly noxious thermal stimulus , and tail - withdrawal latencies measured .
For comparison , tests were conducted in two <START:Disease> acute pain <END> models , the hotplate and warm water tail - withdrawal procedures .
In males , the non - competitive <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> dextromethorphan <END> enhanced the antihyperalgesic effect of low to moderate doses of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in a dose - and time - dependent manner .
Across the doses and pretreatment times examined , enhancement was not observed in females .
Enhancement of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> antinociception by <START:Chemical> dextromethorphan <END> was seen in both males and females in the <START:Disease> acute pain <END> models , with the magnitude of this effect being greater in males .
These findings demonstrate a sexually - dimorphic interaction between <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> antagonists and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in a persistent <START:Disease> pain <END> model that can be distinguished from those observed in <START:Disease> acute pain <END> models .
Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
The aim of the study was to examine the influence of <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> , induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( <START:Chemical> HAL <END> ) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe .
The study was performed on sexually mature male rats .
Serum concentrations of prolactin ( <START:Chemical> PRL <END> ) and <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> T <END> ) were measured .
Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy .
Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti - Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen ( PCNA ) were performed .
In rats of the experimental group , the mean concentration of : <START:Chemical> PRL <END> was more than twice higher , whereas <START:Chemical> T <END> concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group .
Light microscopy visualized the following : <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> and epithelium <START:Disease> hyperplasia <END> of the glandular ducts , associated with increased PCNA expression .
Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells , concerning organelles , engaged in protein synthesis and secretion .
<START:Disease> Serotonin syndrome <END> from <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> - <START:Chemical> tranylcypromine <END> interaction .
Excessive stimulation of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 5 HT 1 A receptors causes a syndrome of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> excess that consists of shivering , <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> salivation <END> , <START:Disease> confusion <END> , <START:Disease> agitation <END> and <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> .
The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) and a specific <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor .
<START:Chemical> Venlafaxine <END> is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> and <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> .
We report a <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> - MAOI interaction that resulted in the <START:Disease> serotonin syndrome <END> in a 23 - y - old male who was taking <START:Chemical> tranylcypromine <END> for <START:Disease> depression <END> .
He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1 / 2 tab of <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> .
Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities , <START:Disease> tremors <END> and <START:Disease> rigidity <END> .
He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering , <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> salivation <END> and diaphoresis .
His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light .
Vital signs were : blood pressure 120 / 67 mm Hg , heart rate 127 / min , respiratory rate 28 / min , and temperature 97 F . After 180 mg of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> i . v . he remained tremulous with <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> and clenched jaws .
He was intubated for airway protection and because of <START:Disease> hypoventilation <END> , and was <START:Disease> paralyzed <END> to control <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
His subsequent course was remarkable for non - immune <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> which resolved .
The patient ' s maximal temperature was 101 . 2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units / L with no other evidence of <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> .
His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward .
This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular <START:Disease> paralysis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ciprofloxacin <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> autoimmune hemolytic anemia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ciprofloxacin <END> has been associated with several side effects including <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
The combination of both side effects is extremely rare .
In this report , we describe a case of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> autoimmune hemolytic anemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemolytic anemia <END> improved after stopping the drug and initiation of <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy .
Unfortunately , acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> was irreversible and the patient developed <START:Disease> end - stage renal disease <END> .
Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> induced in the rat by <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> .
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> induced by <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> were due to <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> per se , or , at least in part , to the <START:Chemical> aminonucleoside <END> .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days ) and the subsequent development of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Since massive <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> occurred after 6 days of treatment , the time - course study was divided into two stages : pre - <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage ( day 1 - 5 ) and <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage ( day 6 - 11 ) .
In pre - <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage the plasma level of <START:Chemical> fatty acids <END> , <START:Chemical> triacylglycerol <END> and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid , <START:Chemical> cholesteryl esters <END> and HDL remained constant .
Plasma apolipoprotein A - I tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) .
At the beginning of <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein A - I increased abruptly ( 4 - fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steeply , in the following days .
The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern .
Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) .
Plasma apolipoprotein A - I was found not only in HDL ( 1 . 063 - 1 . 210 g / ml ) but also in the LDL density class ( 1 . 025 - 1 . 050 g / ml ) .
In the pre - <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage lipoproteinuria was negligible , while in the early <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL .
These observations indicate that <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL .
It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism .
Progestational agents and <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> .
VII .
<START:Disease> Thromboembolic <END> and other complications of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> factors : summary report of a ten - year study .
During a ten - year period , 348 women were studied for a total of 5 , 877 patient months in four separate studies relating <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> to changes in hematologic parameters .
Significant increases in certain factors of the <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> and fibrinolysin systems ( factors I , II , VII , VIII , IX , and X and plasminogen ) were observed in the treated groups .
Severe complications developed in four patients .
All four had an abnormal <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> profile , suggesting " <START:Disease> hypercoagulability <END> " before initiation of therapy .
Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients ; some increased further during therapy .
One of these patients developed a <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> before receiving any medication , shortly after the base - line values were obtained .
One patient developed <START:Disease> retinopathy <END> 19 months after she began therapy , and another developed <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> after 27 months of therapy .
The fourth patient developed <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy .
All four patients were of the A or AB blood group .
Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for <START:Disease> thromboembolic episodes <END> in patients possessing the A antigen .
It appears from these data that hematologic work - ups may be useful in women who are about to start long - term <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Prolongation of the QT interval <END> related to <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> - <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> interaction .
<START:Chemical> Cisapride <END> , a cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 ( CYP 3 A 4 ) substrate , is widely prescribed for the treatment of <START:Disease> gastrointestinal motility disorders <END> .
<START:Disease> Prolongation of QT interval <END> , <START:Disease> torsades de pointes <END> , and <START:Disease> sudden cardiac death <END> have been reported after concomitant administration with <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> or <START:Chemical> azole <END> antifungal agents , but not with other CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors .
A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45 - year - old woman who was taking <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> for <START:Disease> gastroesophageal reflux disorder <END> and <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP 3 A 4 , for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
The patient was in near <START:Disease> syncope <END> and had <START:Disease> QT - interval prolongation <END> .
After discontinuing <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur .
We suggest that caution be taken when <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4 , including <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> .
A prospective study on the dose dependency of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> .
Since 1975 <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> ( <START:Chemical> MMC <END> ) has been suggested to be <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> , especially when combined with or given following <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known .
We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects .
Forty - four <START:Chemical> MMC <END> - treated patients were studied , 37 of them could be evaluated .
All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations , chest X - rays , electro - and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) determinations .
The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level .
One of the patients developed <START:Disease> cardiac failure <END> after 30 mg m - 2 <START:Chemical> MMC <END> and only 150 mg m - 2 <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiac failure <END> was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test .
None of the other patients developed clinical <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> , nor did the studied parameters change .
The literature on this subject was also reviewed .
Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature , we suggest that <START:Chemical> MMC <END> - related <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> is dose dependent , occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m - 2 or more , mainly in patients also ( previously or simultaneously ) treated with <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
The incidence is likely to be less than 10 % even for this risk group .
Thyroid function and urine - concentrating ability during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> and <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
We measured serum <START:Chemical> thyroxine <END> and urine - concentrating ability ( Umax ) in response to desmopressin ( DDAVP ) in 85 patients receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypothyroidism <END> developed in eight patients while they were taking <START:Chemical> lithium <END> .
Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> patients while some <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> patients concentrated their urine well .
It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which <START:Chemical> lithium <END> exerts these two effects are different .
<START:Chemical> Phlorizin <END> - induced <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> does not prevent <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in rats .
Because rats with <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:Disease> DM <END> ) have a high solute diuresis ( <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> of 10 to 12 g / day ) , we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> ( <START:Disease> ARF <END> ) .
The protection from <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> was studied in non - <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular <START:Chemical> glucose <END> reabsorption with <START:Chemical> phlorizin <END> ( <START:Chemical> P <END> ) .
<START:Disease> DM <END> rats with mild <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> ( similar in degree to that of the <START:Chemical> P <END> treated animals ) were also studied .
Unanesthetized adult female , Sprague - Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days .
Group 1 ( <START:Chemical> P <END> alone ) received <START:Chemical> P <END> , 360 mg / day , for 15 days ; Group II ( <START:Chemical> P <END> + <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ) ; Group III ( <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> alone ) and Group IV ( mild <START:Disease> DM <END> + <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxic <END> doses ( 40 mg / kg body wt / day ) of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV .
In Group I , <START:Chemical> P <END> induced a moderate and stable <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> ( 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 g / day , SE ) , and no functional or morphologic evidence of <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> ( baseline CCr 2 . 1 + / - 0 . 1 ml / min , undetectable lysozymuria ) or damage ( <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> score [ maximum 4 ] , zero ) .
In Group II , <START:Chemical> P <END> did not prevent <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - <START:Disease> ARF <END> ( maximal decrease in CCr at day 9 . 89 % , <START:Chemical> P <END> less than 0 . 001 ; peak lysozymuria , 1863 + / - 321 micrograms / day ; and <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> score , 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 ) .
These values were not different from those of Group III : maximal decrease in CCr 73 % ( <START:Chemical> P <END> less than 0 . 001 ) ; lysozymuria , 2147 + / - 701 micrograms / day ; <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> score , 3 . 8 + / - 0 . 1 . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Disease> Bilateral optic neuropathy <END> due to combined <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> treatment .
The case of a 40 - year - old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> is reported .
A <START:Disease> bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy <END> with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic <START:Disease> scotoma <END> was found .
<START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed .
<START:Chemical> Isoniazid <END> was discontinued later , followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity .
The hazards of optic nerve <START:Disease> toxicity <END> due to <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> are known .
We emphasize the potential danger in the use of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> .
Serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase 1 in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> leads to epithelial <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel ( ENaC ) - dependent <START:Disease> volume retention <END> and renal <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> .
The <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> - sensitive serum - and glucocorticoid - inducible kinase SGK 1 has been shown to participate in the stimulation of ENaC and to mediate renal <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> following mineralocorticoid and salt excess .
The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK 1 in the <START:Disease> volume retention <END> and <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> during <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
To this end , <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 15 mug / g body wt ) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK 1 ( sgk 1 ( - / - )) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk 1 ( + / + )) .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> treatment resulted in heavy <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea ) in 15 / 44 of sgk 1 ( + / + ) and 15 / 44 of sgk 1 ( - / - ) mice leading to severe <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> with <START:Disease> ascites <END> , <START:Disease> lipidemia <END> , and <START:Disease> hypoalbuminemia <END> in both genotypes .
Plasma <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> levels increased in <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> mice of both genotypes and was followed by increased SGK 1 protein expression in sgk 1 ( + / + ) mice .
Urinary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion reached signficantly lower values in sgk 1 ( + / + ) mice ( 15 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) than in sgk 1 ( - / - ) mice ( 35 + / - 5 mumol / mg crea ) and was associated with a significantly higher body <START:Disease> weight gain <END> in sgk 1 ( + / + ) compared with sgk 1 ( - / - ) mice ( + 6 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 vs . + 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 8 g ) .
During the course of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> , serum <START:Chemical> urea <END> concentrations increased significantly faster in sgk 1 ( - / - ) mice than in sgk 1 ( + / + ) mice leading to <START:Disease> uremia <END> and a reduced median survival in sgk 1 ( - / - ) mice ( 29 vs . 40 days in sgk 1 ( + / + ) mice ) .
In conclusion , gene - targeted mice lacking SGK 1 showed blunted <START:Disease> volume retention <END> , yet were not protected against renal <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> during experimental <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Severe <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> and <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> secondary to concomitant use of <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> , <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> , and <START:Chemical> atazanavir <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of a severe interaction between <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> , <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> , and <START:Chemical> atazanavir <END> resulting in <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> and <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : A 72 - year - old white man with underlying <START:Disease> human immunodeficiency virus <END> , <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> , <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , and <START:Disease> hyperlipidemia <END> presented with generalized <START:Disease> pain <END> , <START:Disease> fatigue <END> , and dark orange urine for 3 days .
The patient was taking 80 mg <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> at bedtime ( initiated 27 days earlier ) ; <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days , then 200 mg daily ( initiated 19 days earlier ) ; and 400 mg <START:Chemical> atazanavir <END> daily ( initiated at least 2 years previously ) .
Laboratory evaluation revealed 66 , 680 U / L <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase , 93 mg / dL <START:Chemical> blood urea nitrogen <END> , 4 . 6 mg / dL <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , 1579 U / L <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> aminotransferase , and 738 U / L <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase .
<START:Chemical> Simvastatin <END> , <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> , and the patient ' s <START:Disease> human immunodeficiency virus <END> medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis .
Nine days later the patient ' s <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase had dropped to 1695 U / L and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> was 3 . 3 mg / dL .
The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered .
DISCUSSION : The risk of <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> metabolism .
<START:Chemical> Simvastatin <END> is metabolized by CYP 3 A 4 .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> and <START:Chemical> atazanavir <END> are recognized CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors .
CONCLUSIONS : Pharmacokinetic differences in <START:Chemical> statins <END> are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions .
In patients requiring the concurrent use of <START:Chemical> statins <END> and CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors , <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> , <START:Chemical> fluvastatin <END> , and <START:Chemical> rosuvastatin <END> carry the lowest risk of drug interactions ; <START:Chemical> atorvastatin <END> carries moderate risk , whereas <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> and <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors .
Possible teratogenicity of <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> .
Three infants , born of two mothers with <START:Disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> who received treatment with <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> throughout pregnancy , were found to have major <START:Disease> congenital anomalies <END> .
In the singleton pregnancy , the mother had <START:Disease> ulcerative colitis <END> , and the infant , a male , had <START:Disease> coarctation of the aorta <END> and a <START:Disease> ventricular septal defect <END> .
In the twin pregnancy , the mother had <START:Disease> Crohn ' s disease <END> .
The first twin , a female , had a left <START:Disease> Potter - type IIa polycystic kidney <END> and a <START:Disease> rudimentary left uterine cornu <END> .
The second twin , a male , had some features of <START:Disease> Potter ' s facies <END> , <START:Disease> hypoplastic lungs <END> , <START:Disease> absent kidneys and ureters <END> , and <START:Disease> talipes equinovarus <END> .
Despite reports to the contrary , it is suggested that <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> may be teratogenic .
Effect of <START:Chemical> coniine <END> on the developing chick embryo .
<START:Chemical> Coniine <END> , an alkaloid from Conium maculatum ( poison hemlock ) , has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock .
The major teratogenic outcome is <START:Disease> arthrogryposis <END> , presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade .
However , <START:Chemical> coniine <END> has failed to produce <START:Disease> arthrogryposis <END> in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of <START:Chemical> coniine <END> and <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> in the developing chick .
Concentrations of <START:Chemical> coniine <END> and <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> sulfate were 0 . 015 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 075 % , 0 . 15 % , 0 . 75 % , 1 . 5 % , 3 % , and 6 % and 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respectively .
Both compounds caused <START:Disease> deformations <END> and lethality in a dose - dependent manner .
All concentrations of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for <START:Chemical> coniine <END> lethality was 0 . 75 % .
The <START:Disease> deformations <END> caused by both <START:Chemical> coniine <END> and <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> sulfate were <START:Disease> excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes <END> .
No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group ; however , extensive <START:Disease> cranial hemorrhage <END> occurred in all <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> sulfate - treated chicks .
There was a statistically significant ( P < or = 0 . 01 ) decrease in movement in <START:Chemical> coniine <END> and <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound .
Control chicks were in motion an average of 33 . 67 % of the time , while <START:Chemical> coniine <END> - treated chicks were only moving 8 . 95 % of a 5 - min interval , and no movement was observed for <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> sulfate treated chicks .
In summary , the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of <START:Chemical> coniine <END> - induced <START:Disease> arthrogryposis <END> .
Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement .
Effect of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> on <START:Chemical> N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] - formamide <END> - induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat .
The co - administration of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> with <START:Chemical> N - [ 4 - ( 5 - nitro - 2 - furyl ) - 2 - thiazolyl ] - formamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> ) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> - induced <START:Disease> bladder carcinomas <END> but a concomitant induction of <START:Disease> forestomach tumors <END> .
An autoradiographic study was performed on male F - 344 rats fed diet containing <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> at a level of 0 . 2 % and / or <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> at a level of 0 . 5 % to evaluate the effect of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> on the increased cell proliferation induced by <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> in the forestomach and bladder .
<START:Chemical> FANFT <END> - induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> co - administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks .
In the forestomach , and also in the liver , <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> did not affect the <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> - induced increase in labeling index .
The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> in the bladder and forestomach , and that <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ' s effect on <START:Chemical> FANFT <END> in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation .
Also , there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sodium <END> status influences chronic <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in rats .
The <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> potential of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> ( 5 mg / kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks ) has been investigated in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt - loaded rats .
In salt - depleted rats , <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> decreased <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance linearly with time , with an 85 % reduction by week 3 .
In contrast , in normal - salt rats <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3 , and in salt - loaded rats <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43 % at week 3 .
All rats in the <START:Chemical> sodium <END> - depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal - salt or salt - loaded rat .
Concentrations of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study .
However , at the end of 3 weeks , <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt - depleted and normal - salt rats than those in salt - loaded rats , with plasma / kidney ratios of 21 , 14 , and 8 in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt - loaded rats , respectively .
In conclusion , reductions in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance and renal <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> accumulation after chronic <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by <START:Chemical> sodium <END> loading in rats .
Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - ( PR 3 - ANCA ) positive necrotizing <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> after restarting <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> treatment .
A 59 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> ulcerative colitis <END> developed <START:Disease> red eyes <END> , <START:Disease> pleural effusion <END> , <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> and <START:Disease> urinary abnormalities <END> after restarting of <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> treatment .
Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed <START:Disease> segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis <END> without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement .
Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( PR 3 - ANCA ) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units ( EU ) in sera ( normal range less than 10 EU ) , myeloperoxidase - ANCA was negative .
PR 3 - ANCA titer was 250 and 1 , 070 EU in <START:Disease> pleural effusions <END> on right and left side , respectively .
Although cessation of <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> treatment resulted in improvements in <START:Disease> fever <END> , <START:Disease> red eyes <END> , <START:Disease> chest pain <END> , titer of C - reactive protein and volume of the <START:Disease> pleural effusions <END> , we initiated <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy , because PR 3 - ANCA titer rose to 320 EU , eosinophil count increased to 1 , 100 cells / microl , and the <START:Disease> pleural effusion <END> remained .
One month after <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy , the <START:Disease> pleural effusion <END> disappeared , and PR 3 - ANCA titer normalized 3 months later .
This case suggests that <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> can induce PR 3 - ANCA - positive necrotizing <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> .
Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate - release <START:Chemical> oxycodone <END> in healthy middle - aged and older adults .
This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10 - mg dose of immediate - release <START:Chemical> oxycodone <END> in healthy , older ( > 65 years ) , and middle - aged ( 35 to 55 years ) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily <START:Disease> pain <END> .
Seventy - one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition ( placebo , 10 - mg <START:Chemical> oxycodone <END> ) .
Plasma <START:Chemical> oxycodone <END> concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) and pupil size , an indication of physiological effects of the medication , peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose ( P < . 01 ) .
Significant <START:Disease> declines in simple and sustained attention , working memory , and verbal memory <END> were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose .
For almost all cognitive measures , there were no medication by age - interaction effects , which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge .
This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from <START:Disease> chronic pain <END> , neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10 - mg dose of immediate - release <START:Chemical> oxycodone <END> are similar to those observed for middle - aged adults .
PERSPECTIVE : Study findings indicate that the metabolism , neurocognitive effects , and physical side effects of oral <START:Chemical> oxycodone <END> are similar for healthy middle - aged and older adults .
Therefore , clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults .
<START:Chemical> Methylphenidate <END> - induced <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive symptoms <END> in an elderly man .
An 82 - year - old man with <START:Disease> treatment - resistant depression <END> and early <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> was started on <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> .
Significant <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive behavior <END> ensued but diminished over several weeks when <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> was replaced by <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
The patient had no prior <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> history , but he had a sister with <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive disorder <END> .
It appears that <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> precipitated the patient ' s pathological behavior .
The interpeduncular nucleus regulates <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> ' s effects on free - field activity .
Partial lesions were made with <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> in the interpeduncular nucleus of the ventral midbrain of the rat .
Compared with sham - operated controls , lesions significantly ( p < 0 . 25 ) blunted the early ( < 60 min ) free - field <START:Disease> locomotor hypoactivity <END> caused by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> ( 0 . 5 mg kg ( - 1 ) , i . m . ) , enhanced the later ( 60 - 120 min ) <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> , and raised spontaneous nocturnal activity .
Lesions reduced the extent of immunohistological staining for <START:Chemical> choline <END> acetyltransferase in the interpeduncular nucleus ( p < 0 . 025 ) , but not for <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> hydroxylase in the surrounding catecholaminergic A 10 region .
We conclude that the interpeduncular nucleus mediates nicotinic <START:Disease> depression <END> of locomotor activity and dampens nicotinic arousal mechanisms located elsewhere in the brain .
<START:Chemical> Metamizol <END> potentiates <START:Chemical> morphine <END> antinociception but not <START:Disease> constipation <END> after chronic treatment .
This work evaluates the antinociceptive and <START:Disease> constipating <END> effects of the combination of 3 . 2 mg / kg s . c . <START:Chemical> morphine <END> with 177 . 8 mg / kg s . c . <START:Chemical> metamizol <END> in acutely and chronically treated ( once a day for 12 days ) rats .
On the 13 th day , antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception , <START:Disease> pain <END> - induced functional impairment model , and the <START:Chemical> charcoal <END> meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit .
Simultaneous administration of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> with <START:Chemical> metamizol <END> resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single ( 298 + / - 7 vs . 139 + / - 36 units area ( ua ) ; P < 0 . 001 ) and repeated administration ( 280 + / - 17 vs . 131 + / - 22 ua ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
Antinociceptive effect of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> was reduced in chronically treated rats ( 39 + / - 10 vs . 18 + / - 5 au ) while the combination - induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment ( 298 + / - 7 vs . 280 + / - 17 au ) .
Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3 . 2 mg / kg <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> s . c . ( P < 0 . 05 ) , suggesting the partial involvement of the opioidergic system in the synergism observed .
In independent groups , <START:Chemical> morphine <END> inhibited the intestinal transit in 48 + / - 4 % and 38 + / - 4 % after acute and chronic treatment , respectively , suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the <START:Disease> constipating <END> effects .
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> regardless of the time of treatment , suggesting that <START:Chemical> metamizol <END> did not potentiate <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> constipation <END> .
These findings show a significant interaction between <START:Chemical> morphine <END> and <START:Chemical> metamizol <END> in chronically treated rats , suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of <START:Disease> chronic pain <END> .
Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal damage <END> .
BACKGROUND : In man , differences in <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme ( ACE ) levels , related to ACE ( I / D ) genotype , are associated with renal prognosis .
This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage .
Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of <START:Disease> renal damage <END> induced by a single injection of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> in rats .
METHODS : Renal ACE activity ( <START:Chemical> Hip - His - Leu <END> cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats .
After 1 week of recovery , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was induced by <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> [ 1 . 5 mg / kg intravenously ( i . v . ) n = 18 ; controls , saline i . v . n = 9 ] .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> was measured every 2 weeks .
After 12 weeks , rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested .
RESULTS : As anticipated , <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> elicited <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> range <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> renal interstitial damage <END> and mild <START:Disease> focal glomerulosclerosis <END> .
Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> after <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ( r = 0 . 62 , P < 0 . 01 ) , renal interstitial alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 49 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 74 , P < 0 . 01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0 . 48 , P < 0 . 05 ) .
Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with <START:Disease> focal glomerulosclerosis <END> ( r = 0 . 22 , NS ) .
In controls , no predictive values for renal parameters were observed .
CONCLUSION : Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal damage <END> in this outbred rat strain .
This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of <START:Disease> renal damage <END> .
Mice lacking mPGES - 1 are resistant to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
Cyclooxygenase - 2 activity is required for the development of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
However , the involvement of a specific , terminal <START:Chemical> prostaglandin <END> ( <START:Chemical> PG <END> ) isomerase has not been evaluated .
The present study was undertaken to assess <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> in mice deficient in microsomal <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E <END> synthase - 1 ( mPGES - 1 ) .
A 2 - wk administration of <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> ( 4 mmol . kg ( - 1 ) . day ( - 1 ) ip ) in mPGES - 1 + / + mice led to a marked <START:Disease> polyuria <END> with hyposmotic urine .
This was associated with elevated renal mPGES - 1 protein expression and increased urine <START:Chemical> PGE ( 2 ) <END> excretion .
In contrast , mPGES - 1 - / - mice were largely resistant to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> and a urine concentrating defect , accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine <START:Chemical> PGE ( 2 ) <END> and cAMP output .
Immunoblotting , immunohistochemistry , and quantitative ( q ) RT - PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin - 2 ( AQP 2 ) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - treated + / + mice .
This decrease was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
qRT - PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP 2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex .
Similarly , the total protein abundance of the <START:Chemical> Na <END> - <START:Chemical> K <END> - 2 <START:Chemical> Cl <END> cotransporter ( NKCC 2 ) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the + / + mice was significantly reduced by <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
In contrast , the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC 2 expression was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
We conclude that mPGES - 1 - derived <START:Chemical> PGE ( 2 ) <END> mediates <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> likely via inhibition of AQP 2 and NKCC 2 expression .
<START:Chemical> Pravastatin <END> - associated <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
Report of a case .
A case of acute <START:Disease> inflammatory myopathy <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> , a new hydrophilic 3 - hydroxy - 3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor , is reported .
The patient , a 69 - year - old man was affected by <START:Disease> non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
He assumed <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> ( 20 mg / day ) because of <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
He was admitted with acute <START:Disease> myopathy <END> of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> discontinuation .
A previously unknown <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> , probably due to chronic <START:Disease> autoimmune thyroiditis <END> , was evidenced .
Muscle biopsy ( left gastrocnemius ) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD 4 + lymphocytes .
While <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> and <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> have been associated with toxic <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> - associated <START:Disease> myopathy <END> could represent a distinct , inflammatory entity .
Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization - activated <START:Chemical> cyclic nucleotide <END> - gated pacemaker channels by <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
BACKGROUND : Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> , including <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , <START:Disease> coronary heart disease <END> , and chronic <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
Activation of presynaptic alpha 2 - adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ; however , other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
METHODS AND RESULTS : To test whether <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha 2 - adrenoceptors , we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha 2 - adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha 2 ABC - / - ) .
Alpha 2 ABC - / - mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ; however , <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> significantly lowered heart rate in alpha 2 ABC - / - mice by up to 150 bpm .
<START:Chemical> Clonidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> in conscious alpha 2 ABC - / - mice was 32 . 3 % ( 10 microg / kg ) and 26 . 6 % ( 100 microg / kg ) of the effect in wild - type mice .
A similar bradycardic effect of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha 2 ABC - knockout and wild - type mice .
<START:Chemical> Clonidine <END> inhibited the native pacemaker current ( I ( f )) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I ( f ) - generating hyperpolarization - activated <START:Chemical> cyclic nucleotide <END> - gated ( HCN ) 2 and HCN 4 channels in transfected HEK 293 cells .
As a consequence of blocking I ( f ) , <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild - type and alpha 2 ABC - knockout mice .
CONCLUSIONS : Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> gene - targeted mice in vivo , and thus , <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> - like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors .
Epidemic of <START:Disease> liver disease <END> caused by <START:Chemical> hydrochlorofluorocarbons <END> used as <START:Chemical> ozone <END> - sparing substitutes of <START:Chemical> chlorofluorocarbons <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Hydrochlorofluorocarbons <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCFCs <END> ) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for <START:Chemical> ozone <END> - depleting <START:Chemical> chlorofluorocarbons <END> ( <START:Chemical> CFCs <END> ) .
Limited studies in animals indicate potential <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> of some of these compounds .
We investigated an epidemic of <START:Disease> liver disease <END> in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of <START:Chemical> 1 , 1 - dichloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCFC 123 <END> ) and <START:Chemical> 1 - chloro - 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCFC 124 <END> ) .
All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees .
Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as <START:Chemical> 1 - bromo - 1 - chloro - 2 , 2 , 2 - trifluoroethane <END> ( <START:Chemical> halothane <END> ) to form reactive <START:Chemical> trifluoroacetyl <END> halide intermediates , which have been implicated in the <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> halothane <END> .
We aimed to test whether <START:Chemical> HCFCs 123 and 124 <END> can result in serious <START:Disease> liver disease <END> .
METHODS : For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of <START:Chemical> trifluoroacetyl <END> protein adducts were done .
The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome - P 450 2 E 1 ( P 450 2 E 1 ) and P 58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform ( P 58 ) .
FINDINGS : The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular <START:Disease> necrosis <END> which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas ( bridging <START:Disease> necrosis <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Trifluoroacetyl <END> - adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes .
Autoantibodies against P 450 2 E 1 or P 58 , previously associated with <START:Disease> halothane hepatitis <END> , were detected in the serum of five affected workers .
INTERPRETATION : Repeated exposure of human beings to <START:Chemical> HCFCs 123 and 124 <END> can result in serious <START:Disease> liver injury <END> in a large proportion of the exposed population .
Although the exact mechanism of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> of these agents is not known , the results suggest that <START:Chemical> trifluoroacetyl <END> - altered liver proteins are involved .
In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds , there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives .
Effects of <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> on cholinesterase and <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> on cholinesterase , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well - known cholinesterase inhibitors <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> and <START:Chemical> E - 2020 <END> .
<START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> , <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> and <START:Chemical> E - 2020 <END> all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) in human red blood cells ( IC 50 s = 1 . 0 x 10 ( - 6 ) , 2 . 9 x 10 ( - 7 ) and 3 . 7 x 10 ( - 8 ) M , respectively ) .
In addition , <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> , but not <START:Chemical> E - 2020 <END> , strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase ( BuChE ) in human serum .
All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity .
Moreover , the inhibitory effect of <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> on AChE was reversible .
All compounds at 0 . 1 - 1 mg / kg p . o . significantly improved the <START:Disease> amnesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 0 . 5 mg / kg s . c . ) in rats performing a passive avoidance task .
The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg / kg p . o . did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> at a low dose ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg / kg p . o . ) improves <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> but does not affect spontaneous movement .
The findings suggest that <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> may be a useful drug for the treatment of <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
Serial <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> caused by <START:Chemical> levodopa / carbidopa <END> administration in two patients on hemodialysis .
Two patients with similar clinical features are presented : both patients had <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> , on hemodialysis for many years but recently begun on a high - flux dialyzer ; both had been receiving a <START:Chemical> carbidopa / levodopa <END> preparation ; and both had the onset of <START:Disease> hallucinosis <END> and recurrent <START:Disease> seizures <END> , which were refractory to anticonvulsants .
The first patient died without a diagnosis ; the second patient had a dramatic recovery following the administration of <START:Chemical> vitamin B 6 <END> .
Neither patient was considered to have a renal state sufficiently severe enough to explain their presentation .
Minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunction <END> , cognitive development , and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment in very - low birth - weight infants .
The objective of this study was to assess minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunction <END> , cognitive development , and somatic development after <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> therapy in very - low - birthweight infants .
Thirty - three children after <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment were matched to 33 children without <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment .
Data were assessed at the age of 3 - 7 years .
<START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> was started between the 7 th and the 28 th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2 . 35 mg / kg / day .
Exclusion criteria were <START:Disease> asphyxia <END> , <START:Disease> malformations <END> , major surgical interventions , small for gestational age , intraventricular <START:Disease> haemorrhage <END> grades III and IV , <START:Disease> periventricular leukomalacia <END> , and severe <START:Disease> psychomotor retardation <END> .
Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunctions <END> and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw - a - Man Test .
There were no differences in demographic data , growth , and socio - economic status between the two groups .
Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
In the Draw - a - Man Test , the control group showed better results ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
There were no differences in development of speech , social development , and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children .
After <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment , children showed a higher rate of minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunctions <END> .
Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis .
Further long - term follow - up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> on neurological and cognitive development .
Severe <START:Chemical> citrate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation .
We report a case of severe <START:Chemical> citrate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection .
The donor was a 40 - year - old female , first - time apheresis platelet donor .
Past medical history was remarkable for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , <START:Disease> hyperlipidemia <END> , and <START:Disease> depression <END> .
Reported medications included <START:Chemical> bumetanide <END> , <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> , and <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> .
Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure , the donor noted tingling around the mouth , hands , and feet .
She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity <START:Disease> tetany <END> .
Empirical treatment with intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium gluconate <END> was initiated , and <START:Disease> muscle contractions <END> slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes .
The events are consistent with a severe reaction to <START:Chemical> calcium <END> chelation by <START:Chemical> sodium citrate <END> anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> .
Upon additional retrospective analysis , it was noted that <START:Chemical> bumetanide <END> is a <START:Chemical> loop diuretic <END> that may cause significant <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> .
We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to <START:Chemical> citrate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Laboratory measurement of pre - procedure serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance .
The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors .
Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of <START:Chemical> 2 - chloroprocaine - CE <END> , <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , and low pH normal saline in dogs .
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of <START:Chemical> 2 - chloroprocaine - CE <END> in experimental animals .
The possible role of low pH as well as total volume as potential factors in causing <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> was evaluated .
The 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows : 6 to 8 ml of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( N = 15 ) , <START:Chemical> 2 - chloroprocaine - CE <END> ( N = 20 ) , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) ( N = 20 ) , or normal saline ( N = 10 ) .
Of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of <START:Chemical> 2 - chloroprocaine - CE <END> seven ( 35 % ) developed hind - limb <START:Disease> paralysis <END> .
None of the animals that received <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , normal saline , or normal saline titrated to a pH 3 . 0 developed hind - limb <START:Disease> paralysis <END> .
Of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received <START:Chemical> 2 - chloroprocaine - CE <END> , 13 showed <START:Disease> subpial necrosis <END> ; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal .
The spinal cords of the animals that received <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , low pH normal saline ( pH 3 . 0 ) , or normal saline did not show abnormal findings .
Delayed <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> with <START:Disease> stroke <END> - like presentation in chemotherapy recipients .
BACKGROUND : A transient <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> mimicking <START:Disease> cerebrovascular accident <END> has been described as a complication of chemotherapy , most commonly in recipients of intrathecal <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> for childhood <START:Disease> leukaemia <END> .
Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration .
METHODS : We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with <START:Disease> stroke <END> - like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy .
We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data .
Patients with <START:Disease> cerebrovascular accidents <END> were excluded .
RESULTS : We identified 27 reports of toxic <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> in patients treated with <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> ( intrathecal , systemic ) , <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> and its derivative <START:Chemical> carmofur <END> , and <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> .
Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense <START:Disease> lesions within the subcortical white matter <END> of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum , corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients ) .
Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories .
Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities .
However , fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) sequences frequently revealed persistent <START:Disease> white matter abnormalities <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Several pathophysiological models of delayed <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed .
DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of <START:Disease> cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter <END> and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome .
Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses .
OBJECTIVE : The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> , yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied .
This study assessed the effect of normal aging on ( 1 ) the <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> - induced increase in pupil diameter , and ( 2 ) the reversal of this effect with <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Scopolamine <END> was used as a positive control to detect age - dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly .
DESIGN : Randomized double - blind controlled trial .
PARTICIPANTS : Ten healthy elderly ( mean age 70 ) and 9 young ( mean age 33 ) volunteers .
INTERVENTIONS : Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours .
The study involved 4 sessions .
In 1 session , <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other .
In another session , <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to both eyes , followed 23 minutes later by the application of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ( 20 microL , 0 . 1 % ) to one eye and placebo to the other .
All eye drops were given in a randomized order .
In 2 separate sessions , a single dose of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 0 . 5 mg , intravenously ) or placebo was administered , and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours .
OUTCOME MEASURES : Pupil size at time points after administration of <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> and <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ; <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> impairment in word recall <END> .
RESULTS : There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> at any time point ( p > 0 . 05 ) .
The elderly group had a significantly greater <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced net decrease in pupil size 85 , 125 , 165 and 215 minutes after administration , compared with the young group ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Compared with the young group , the elderly group had greater <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> impairment in word recall <END> 60 , 90 and 120 minutes after administration ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
CONCLUSION : There is an age - related pupillary response to <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> that is not found with <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> .
Thus , <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients .
Further observations on the electrophysiologic effects of oral <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> therapy .
A case is presented of a reversible <START:Disease> intra - Hisian block <END> occurring under <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> treatment for <START:Disease> atrial tachycardia <END> in a patient without clear <START:Disease> intraventricular conduction abnormalities <END> .
His bundle recordings showed an <START:Disease> atrial tachycardia <END> with intermittent exit block and greatly prolonged BH and HV intervals ( 40 and 100 msec , respectively ) .
Thirty days after <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> discontinuation , His bundle electrograms showed <START:Disease> atrial flutter <END> without intra - Hisian or infra - Hisian delay .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> should be used with caution during long - term oral therapy in patients with or without clear intraventricular conduction defects .
Normalizing effects of <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> on sleep in chronic <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> users .
OBJECTIVE : The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of morning - dosed <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> on sleep and <START:Disease> daytime sleepiness <END> in chronic <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> users .
METHOD : Twenty <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - dependent participants were randomly assigned to receive <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> , 400 mg ( N = 10 ) , or placebo ( N = 10 ) every morning at 7 : 30 a . m . for 16 days in an inpatient , double - blind randomized trial .
Participants underwent polysomnographic sleep recordings on days 1 to 3 , 7 to 9 , and 14 to 16 ( first , second , and third weeks of abstinence ) .
The Multiple Sleep Latency Test was performed at 11 : 30 a . m . , 2 : 00 p . m . , and 4 : 30 p . m . on days 2 , 8 , and 15 .
For comparison of sleep architecture variables , 12 healthy comparison participants underwent a single night of experimental polysomnography that followed 1 night of accommodation polysomnography .
RESULTS : Progressive abstinence from <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes .
Compared with placebo , <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow - wave sleep time in <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - dependent participants .
The effect of <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence .
Comparison of slow - wave sleep time , total sleep time , and sleep latency in <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> in <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - dependent participants .
<START:Chemical> Modafinil <END> was associated with increased daytime sleep latency , as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test , and a nearly significant decrease in subjective <START:Disease> daytime sleepiness <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Morning - dosed <START:Chemical> modafinil <END> promotes nocturnal sleep , normalizes sleep architecture , and decreases <START:Disease> daytime sleepiness <END> in abstinent <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> users .
These effects may be relevant in the treatment of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> dependence .
<START:Disease> Stroke <END> associated with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
We describe eight patients in whom <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use was related to <START:Disease> stroke <END> and review 39 cases from the literature .
Among these 47 patients the mean ( + / - SD ) age was 32 . 5 + / - 12 . 1 years ; 76 % ( 34 / 45 ) were men .
<START:Disease> Stroke <END> followed <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use by inhalation , intranasal , intravenous , and intramuscular routes .
<START:Disease> Intracranial aneurysms <END> or <START:Disease> arteriovenous malformations <END> were present in 17 of 32 patients studied angiographically or at autopsy ; <START:Disease> cerebral vasculitis <END> was present in two patients .
<START:Disease> Cerebral infarction <END> occurred in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> in 22 ( 49 % ) , and <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> in 13 ( 29 % ) .
These data indicate that ( 1 ) the apparent incidence of <START:Disease> stroke <END> related to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use is increasing ; ( 2 ) <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - associated <START:Disease> stroke <END> occurs primarily in young adults ; ( 3 ) <START:Disease> stroke <END> may follow any route of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> administration ; ( 4 ) <START:Disease> stroke <END> after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use is frequently associated with <START:Disease> intracranial aneurysms <END> and <START:Disease> arteriovenous malformations <END> ; and ( 5 ) in <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - associated <START:Disease> stroke <END> , the frequency of <START:Disease> intracranial hemorrhage <END> exceeds that of <START:Disease> cerebral infarction <END> .
<START:Chemical> 99 mTc - glucarate <END> for detection of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
<START:Disease> Infarct <END> - avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
The animal model used to produce <START:Disease> infarction <END> implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> .
A new <START:Disease> infarct <END> - avid radiopharmaceutical based on <START:Chemical> glucaric acid <END> was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ .
<START:Chemical> 99 mTc - glucarate <END> was easy to prepare , stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an <START:Disease> infarct <END> 18 h after <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> administration .
The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys .
Thirty minutes after <START:Chemical> 99 mTc - glucarate <END> administration the standardised heart uptake value S ( h ) UV was 4 . 7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats .
ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4 . 4 .
The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect , in patients , early <START:Disease> cardiac infarction <END> .
Immunohistochemical , electron microscopic and morphometric studies of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - induced rat <START:Disease> prolactinomas <END> after <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> treatment .
To clarify the effects of <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> on <START:Disease> prolactinoma <END> cells in vivo , immunohistochemical , ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - induced rat <START:Disease> prolactinoma <END> cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> ( 3 mg / kg of body weight ) .
One h after treatment , serum prolactin levels decreased markedly .
Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules , slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum , and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the <START:Disease> prolactinoma <END> cells .
Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased , while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased .
These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules .
At 6 h after injection , serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls .
The <START:Disease> prolactinoma <END> cells at this time were well granulated , with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae .
Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules , Golgi cisternae , and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat <START:Disease> prolactinoma <END> cells .
However , only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> treatment of the <START:Disease> adenoma <END> cells .
An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis , suggesting that <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion .
<START:Chemical> Calcium carbonate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> : the updated <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> ; report of 3 cases and review of the literature .
OBJECTIVE : To describe 3 patients with <START:Chemical> calcium carbonate <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and gain insights into the cause and management of the <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> .
METHODS : We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> ( corrected serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> > or = 14 mg / dL ) and review the pertinent literature on <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> .
RESULTS : The 3 patients had <START:Disease> acute renal insufficiency <END> , relative <START:Disease> metabolic alkalosis <END> , and low parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , PTH - related peptide , and <START:Chemical> 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D <END> concentrations .
No malignant lesion was found .
Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> .
The 2 patients with the higher serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> concentrations received <START:Chemical> pamidronate <END> intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg , respectively ) , which caused severe <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> .
Of the 3 patients , 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental <START:Chemical> calcium <END> ( 1 g and 2 g daily , respectively ) in the form of <START:Chemical> calcium carbonate <END> .
In addition to our highlighted cases , we review the history , classification , pathophysiologic features , and treatment of <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003 .
CONCLUSION : <START:Disease> Milk - alkali syndrome <END> may be a common cause of unexplained <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested <START:Chemical> calcium carbonate <END> in susceptible persons .
Treatment with hydration , <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> , and discontinuation of the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> source is adequate .
<START:Chemical> Pamidronate <END> treatment is associated with considerable risk for <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> , even in cases of initially severe <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> .
Systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> following administration of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> ( formerly <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ) for <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> : association of <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> ( formerly <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T - cell activation .
After 2 individuals with <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> developed a <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> following treatment with oral <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis .
OBSERVATIONS : A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> - induced <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> had a 2 . 3 - fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48 % ) compared with an unaffected <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> - treated patient with <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> ( 21 % ) .
Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced apoptosis than did normal T cells , particularly in the presence of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Severe adverse effects of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> include <START:Disease> fever <END> , <START:Disease> anemia <END> , and <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> .
These symptoms may be the result of drug - induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes , especially activated T lymphocytes , and possibly release of inflammatory mediators .
Because patients with severe <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> may develop <START:Disease> capillary leak <END> from various systemic therapies , clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with <START:Disease> inflammatory diseases <END> who are treated with immune modulators .
<START:Disease> Venous complications <END> of <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> versus <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> .
Although some studies have suggested fewer <START:Disease> venous complications <END> are associated with <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> than with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> for endoscopic procedures , this variable has not been well documented .
We prospectively evaluated the incidence of <START:Disease> venous complications <END> after intravenous injection of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> or <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy .
Overall , <START:Disease> venous complications <END> were more frequent with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 22 of 62 patients ) than with <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> ( 4 of 60 patients ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
A palpable venous cord was present in 23 % ( 14 of 62 ) of patients in the <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> group , compared with 2 % ( 1 of 60 patients ) in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group ( p < 0 . 002 ) .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> at the injection site occurred in 35 % ( 22 of 62 ) of patients in the <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> group compared with 7 % ( 4 of 60 patients ) in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
<START:Disease> Swelling <END> and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups .
Smoking , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug use , intravenous catheter site , dwell time of the needle , <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> use , and <START:Disease> pain <END> during the injection had no effect on the incidence of <START:Disease> venous complications <END> .
The protective role of Nrf 2 in <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
OBJECTIVE : <START:Disease> Diabetic nephropathy <END> is one of the major causes of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , which is accompanied by the production of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species ( ROS ) .
Nrf 2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis .
Here , we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf 2 against <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We explore the protective role of Nrf 2 against <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> using human kidney biopsy tissues from <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> patients , a <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> model in Nrf 2 ( - / - ) mice , and cultured human mesangial cells .
RESULTS : The glomeruli of human <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf 2 levels .
In the animal study , Nrf 2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal damage <END> .
This is evident by Nrf 2 ( - / - ) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and <START:Disease> renal injury <END> compared with Nrf 2 ( + / + ) mice .
Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf 2 - mediated protection against <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> is , at least , partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) and reduction of extracellular matrix production .
In human renal mesangial cells , high <START:Chemical> glucose <END> induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf 2 and its downstream genes .
Furthermore , activation or overexpression of Nrf 2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta 1 in a dose - dependent manner , whereas knockdown of Nrf 2 by siRNA enhanced TGF - beta 1 transcription and fibronectin production .
CONCLUSIONS : This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf 2 in <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> , suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf 2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
On two paradoxical side - effects of <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> in rats , ribosomal RNA biosyntheses , and a mechanism of action .
<START:Disease> Liver enlargement <END> and <START:Disease> muscle wastage <END> occurred in Wistar rats following the subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> .
In the liver both the content of RNA and the biosynthesis of ribosomal RNA increased while both the RNA content and ribosomal RNA biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle .
It is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue - specific manner to enhance ribosomal RNA synthesis in the liver and depress such synthesis in the muscle .
This view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> action .
Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L . , <START:Chemical> crocin <END> on <START:Chemical> streptozocin <END> - induced model of sporadic <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> in male rats .
BACKGROUND : The involvement of water - soluble <START:Chemical> carotenoids <END> , <START:Chemical> crocins <END> , as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L . extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed .
In the present study , the effect of <START:Chemical> crocins <END> on sporadic <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> induced by intracerebroventricular ( icv ) <START:Chemical> streptozocin <END> ( <START:Chemical> STZ <END> ) in male rats was investigated .
METHODS : Male adult Wistar rats ( n = 90 and 260 - 290 g ) were divided into 1 , control ; 2 and 3 , <START:Chemical> crocins <END> ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) ; 4 , <START:Chemical> STZ <END> ; 5 and 6 , <START:Chemical> STZ <END> + <START:Chemical> crocins <END> ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) groups .
In <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> groups , rats were injected with <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - icv bilaterally ( 3 mg / kg ) in first day and 3 days later , a similar <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - icv application was repeated .
In <START:Chemical> STZ <END> + <START:Chemical> crocin <END> animal groups , <START:Chemical> crocin <END> was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg / kg , i . p . , one day pre - surgery and continued for three weeks .
Prescription of <START:Chemical> crocin <END> in each dose was repeated once for two days .
However , the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm , and for spatial cognition evaluation , Y - maze task was used .
RESULTS : It was found out that <START:Chemical> crocin <END> ( 30 mg / kg ) - treated <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y - maze than vehicle - treated <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - injected rats .
In addition , <START:Chemical> crocin <END> in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated <START:Disease> learning and memory impairment <END> in treated <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - injected group in passive avoidance test .
CONCLUSION : Therefore , these results demonstrate the effectiveness of <START:Chemical> crocin <END> ( 30 mg / kg ) in antagonizing the <START:Disease> cognitive deficits <END> caused by <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of <START:Disease> neurodegenerative diseases <END> such as <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
Effects of <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> on the threshold for initiating <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> during <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiac arrhythmias <END> have frequently been reported in association with <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> .
The possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating <START:Disease> cardiac disturbances <END> in patients with <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> has only recently been emphasized .
The effects of <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> on the <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> threshold during normal acid - base conditions and during <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> were studied in anesthetized open chest dogs .
The <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycle .
During the infusion of <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> , the <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when pH and partial pressures of <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> ( <START:Chemical> PO 2 <END> ) and <START:Chemical> carbon dioxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CO 2 <END> ) were kept within normal limits .
When <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> was produced by <START:Disease> hypoventilation <END> ( pH 7 . 05 to 7 . 25 ; PC 02 70 to 100 mm Hg : P 02 20 to 40 mm Hg ) , infusion of <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> resulted in an even greater decrease in <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> threshold to 60 percent of the control level .
These experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> in <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> , pharmacologic agents , particularly <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> , may play a significant role .
<START:Disease> Cerebral sinus thrombosis <END> as a potential hazard of antifibrinolytic treatment in <START:Disease> menorrhagia <END> .
We describe a 42 - year - old woman who developed superior <START:Disease> sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis <END> associated with prolonged <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> therapy for <START:Disease> menorrhagia <END> .
This antifibrinolytic agent has been used in women with <START:Disease> menorrhagia <END> to promote clotting and reduce <START:Disease> blood loss <END> .
Although increased risk of <START:Disease> thromboembolic disease <END> has been reported during treatment with <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> , <START:Disease> cerebral sinus thrombosis <END> has not been previously described .
Careful use of <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> therapy is recommended .
Prospective study of the long - term effects of somatostatin analog ( <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> ) on gallbladder function and <START:Disease> gallstone <END> formation in Chinese <START:Disease> acromegalic <END> patients .
This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active <START:Disease> acromegaly <END> treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> in dosages of 300 - 1500 micrograms / day for a mean of 24 . 2 + / - 13 . 9 months .
During treatment with <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> , 17 patients developed sludge , 10 had <START:Disease> gallstones <END> , and 1 developed <START:Disease> acute cholecystitis <END> requiring surgery .
In all of 7 patients examined acutely , gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100 - micrograms injection .
In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks , gallbladder contractility remained <START:Disease> depressed <END> throughout therapy .
After withdrawal of <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> in 10 patients without <START:Disease> gallstones <END> , 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month .
In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed <START:Disease> gallstones <END> during treatment , gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients ( 3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks ) , and remained <START:Disease> depressed <END> in 3 ( 2 of whom had stones present at 6 months ) .
Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge , <START:Disease> gallstones <END> , and <START:Disease> cholecystitis <END> during <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> therapy in Chinese <START:Disease> acromegalic <END> patients .
It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long - term <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> therapy of <START:Disease> acromegalic <END> patients .
Changes in <START:Disease> depressive <END> status associated with topical beta - blockers .
<START:Disease> Depression <END> and <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> have been related to side effects of topical beta - blockers .
We performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta - blocker ( <START:Chemical> timolol <END> ) and a selective beta - blocker ( <START:Chemical> betaxolol <END> ) regarding CNS side effects .
Eight <START:Disease> glaucomatous <END> patients chronically treated with <START:Chemical> timolol <END> 0 . 5 % / 12 h , suffering from <START:Disease> depression <END> diagnosed through DMS - III - R criteria , were included in the study .
During the six - month follow up , <START:Disease> depression <END> was quantified through the Beck and Zung - Conde scales every two months .
In a double blind cross - over study with control group , the patients under <START:Chemical> timolol <END> treatment presented higher <START:Disease> depression <END> values measured through the Beck and the Zung - Conde scales ( p < 0 . 001 vs control ) .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> betaxolol <END> could be less of a <START:Disease> depression <END> - inducer than <START:Chemical> timolol <END> in predisposed patients .
A <START:Disease> dystonia <END> - like syndrome after neuropeptide ( <START:Chemical> MSH <END> / <START:Chemical> ACTH <END> ) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus .
The <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic <START:Disease> dystonia <END> , and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit .
The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE - mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway .
However , it is not certain as to the following : ( a ) what receptors were stimulated by the <START:Chemical> ACTH <END> N - terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder ; ( b ) whether NE , released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway , did indeed cause the long - term <START:Disease> depression <END> at Purkinje cell synapses ( previously described by others ) that resulted in the long duration of the <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> ; ( c ) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei , the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons , that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder .
These questions are currently being investigated .
Comparison of i . v . <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> and <START:Chemical> atropine <END> in the prevention of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> following repeated doses of <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> in children .
The effectiveness of administration of <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> 5 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 and <START:Chemical> atropine <END> 10 and 20 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . immediately before the induction of anaesthesia , to prevent <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> following repeated doses of <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> in children , was studied .
A control group was included for comparison with the lower dose range of <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> and <START:Chemical> atropine <END> .
A frequency of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> of 50 % was noted in the control group , but this was not significantly different from the frequency with the active drugs .
<START:Disease> Bradycardia <END> ( defined as a decrease in heart rate to less than 50 beat min - 1 ) was prevented when the larger dose of either active drug was used .
It is recommended that either <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> 10 micrograms kg - 1 or <START:Chemical> atropine <END> 20 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . should immediately precede induction of anaesthesia , in children , if the repeated administration of <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> is anticipated .
Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve .
PURPOSE : To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) on the retina and optic nerve .
SETTING : Eye Clinic , S . Salvatore Hospital , L ' Aquila University , Italy .
METHODS : Standard pattern electroretinograms ( P - ERGs ) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials ( P - VEPs ) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5 . 00 and 15 . 00 diopters ( D ) ( mean 8 . 00 D ) .
Testing was done preoperatively and 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months postoperatively .
The contralateral eyes served as controls .
During the follow - up , 3 patients ( 12 % ) developed <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - induced <START:Disease> elevated intraocular pressure <END> ( IOP ) that resolved after <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> therapy was discontinued .
RESULTS : No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively .
CONCLUSION : Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment .
The transient <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - induced <START:Disease> IOP rise <END> did not seem to cause functional impairment .
<START:Chemical> Chloroacetaldehyde <END> and its contribution to urotoxicity during treatment with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> or <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> .
An experimental study / short communication .
Based on clinical data , indicating that <START:Chemical> chloroacetaldehyde <END> ( <START:Chemical> CAA <END> ) is an important metabolite of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics , an experimental study was carried out in order to elucidate the role of <START:Chemical> CAA <END> in the development of <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
The data demonstrate that <START:Chemical> CAA <END> after i . v . administration does not contribute to <START:Disease> bladder damage <END> .
When instilled directly into the bladder , <START:Chemical> CAA <END> exerts urotoxic effects , it is , however , susceptible to detoxification with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> .
Reversible <START:Disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> related to <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> therapy .
We describe a patient who developed <START:Disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and clinical congestive <START:Disease> heart failure <END> after 2 months of therapy with <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> ( <START:Chemical> AmB <END> ) for disseminated <START:Disease> coccidioidomycosis <END> .
His echocardiographic abnormalities and <START:Disease> heart failure <END> resolved after <START:Chemical> posaconazole <END> was substituted for <START:Chemical> AmB <END> .
It is important to recognize the rare and potentially reversible <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> AmB <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> treatment for severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in immunocompromised children .
BACKGROUND : Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host .
The incidence of severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children , where case fatality rates as high as 50 % to 80 % have been reported .
There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> , nor are there any prospective randomized , controlled trials of potentially useful anti - adenovirus therapies .
Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> is limited to a few case reports and small series .
Experience is greatest with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> and <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ribavirin <END> , a <START:Chemical> guanosine <END> analogue , has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses , including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro .
<START:Chemical> Ribavirin <END> is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of <START:Disease> respiratory syncytial virus infection <END> , and orally in combination with interferon to treat <START:Disease> hepatitis C <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> is the treatment of choice for <START:Disease> infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses <END> .
The most common adverse effect of intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> is reversible mild <START:Disease> anemia <END> .
The use of <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> in severe <START:Disease> adenovirus infection <END> has been limited by adverse effects , the most significant of which is <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
OBJECTIVE : We report our experience with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> therapy for severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature .
DESIGN / METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> for documented severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> .
Two patients developed adenovirus <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> after cardiac and bone marrow transplants , respectively .
The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> for progressive disseminated disease .
An additional 3 children developed <START:Disease> adenovirus pneumonia <END> ; 2 were neonates , 1 of whom had partial <START:Disease> DiGeorge syndrome <END> .
The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> was administered on a compassionate - use protocol .
RESULTS : Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children : the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> and the immunocompetent neonate with <START:Disease> adenovirus pneumonia <END> .
The remaining 3 children died of <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> therapy was well tolerated .
Use of <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> in 1 child was associated with <START:Disease> progressive renal failure <END> and <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> .
DISCUSSION : Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> , namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients , neonates , and children with <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> .
Although intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> was not effective for all children with severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in this series or in the literature , therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the <START:Disease> infection <END> .
Early identification , eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response .
CONCLUSIONS : Two of 5 children with severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> recovered .
The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction , may make earlier , more effective treatment of <START:Disease> adenovirus infection <END> possible .
Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in certain hosts , especially children , a large , multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies , such as intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> : clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations .
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> may result in <START:Disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> .
In individuals with preexisting , high - grade coronary arterial narrowing , <START:Disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> may result from an increase in myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> demand associated with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced increase in rate - pressure product .
In other individuals with no underlying <START:Disease> atherosclerotic obstruction <END> , <START:Disease> coronary occlusion <END> may be due to <START:Disease> spasm <END> , <START:Disease> thrombus <END> , or both .
With regard to <START:Disease> spasm <END> , the clinical findings are largely circumstantial , and the locus of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative .
Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that <START:Disease> spasm <END> involves the epicardial , medium - size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction .
Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete <START:Disease> infarction <END> .
Whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha - mediated , other in vitro data suggest the opposite .
The finding of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects .
Finally , the contribution of a primary , <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> has not been excluded .
<START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> - induced <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
A report of two cases .
Two patients with signs of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> after combined treatment with <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> entry blocker .
Use of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> should either be avoided or prescribed only with appropriate adjustment of the <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> dose ( usually reduction of the <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> dose by one half ) .
<START:Disease> Cerebral vasculitis <END> following oral <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> intake in an adult : a case report .
<START:Chemical> Methylphenidate <END> is structurally and functionally similar to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
<START:Disease> Cerebral vasculitis <END> associated with <START:Disease> amphetamine abuse <END> is well documented , and in rare cases <START:Disease> ischaemic stroke <END> has been reported after <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> intake in children .
We report the case of a 63 - year - old female who was treated with <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> due to <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> and suffered from multiple <START:Disease> ischaemic strokes <END> .
We consider drug - induced <START:Disease> cerebral vasculitis <END> as the most likely cause of recurrent <START:Disease> ischaemic strokes <END> in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work - up .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> mediated <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> therapy .
This potential side - effect , though very rare , represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> .
The 3 - week <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> syndrome strikes again .
A 34 - year - old lady developed a constellation of <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> , <START:Disease> fever <END> , <START:Disease> lymphadenopathy <END> and <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> , beginning on the 17 th day of a course of oral <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> for sero - negative <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising <START:Disease> lymphadenitis <END> , associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates , without viral inclusion bodies , suggestive of an <START:Disease> adverse drug reaction <END> . A week later , fulminant <START:Disease> drug - induced hepatitis <END> , associated with the presence of anti - nuclear autoantibodies ( but not with other markers of <START:Disease> autoimmunity <END> ) , and accompanied by <START:Disease> multi - organ failure <END> and <START:Disease> sepsis <END> , supervened .
She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy . Post - mortem examination showed evidence of <START:Disease> massive hepatocellular necrosis <END> , acute hypersensitivity <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> , focal acute tubulo - interstitial <START:Disease> nephritis <END> and extensive <START:Disease> bone marrow necrosis <END> , with no evidence of <START:Disease> malignancy <END> .
It is thought that the clinico - pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so - called " 3 - week <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> syndrome " , a rare , but often fatal , immunoallergic reaction to <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Apomorphine <END> : an underutilized therapy for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> Apomorphine <END> was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951 , the potential of treating fluctuating <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> by subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> has only recently become the subject of systematic study .
A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and that <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings .
Continuous subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> infusions can reduce daily off - time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add - on therapy with oral <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> agonists or COMT inhibitors .
Extended follow - up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long - term persistence of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> efficacy .
In addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
The main side effects of subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> complications play a lesser role .
Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> treatment in fluctuating <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use .
Preservation of renal blood flow during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced with <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> in dogs .
The introduction of drugs that could induce <START:Disease> hypotension <END> with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy .
Specific <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - 1 , ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> 1 ) and <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - 2 ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> 2 ) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation .
<START:Chemical> Fenoldopam mesylate <END> is a specific DA 1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation .
The hypothesis that <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> could be used to induce <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested .
Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively , in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> and <START:Chemical> sodium <END> <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> in ten dogs under <START:Chemical> halothane <END> general anaesthesia .
Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 + / - 8 per cent from control with infusion of <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> ( 3 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) and 34 + / - 4 per cent with infusion of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> ( 5 . 9 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) ( NS ) .
Renal blood flow ( RBF ) increased during <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> 11 + / - 7 per cent and decreased 21 + / - 8 per cent during <START:Chemical> sodium <END> <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
Sodium <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> is a non - selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Fenoldopam is a selective <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - 1 ( DA 1 ) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA 1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
<START:Disease> Diseases of peripheral nerves <END> as seen in the Nigerian African .
The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of <START:Disease> peripheral nerve disease <END> excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders , as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented .
There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade .
<START:Disease> Sensori - motor neuropathy <END> was the commonest presentation ( 50 % ) .
<START:Disease> Guillain - Barr syndrome <END> was the commonest identifiable cause ( 15 . 6 % ) , accounting for half of the cases with <START:Disease> motor neuropathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Peripheral neuropathy <END> due to <START:Disease> nutritional deficiency <END> of <START:Chemical> thiamine <END> and <START:Chemical> riboflavin <END> was common ( 10 . 1 % ) and presented mainly as sensory and <START:Disease> sensori - motor neuropathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Diabetes mellitus <END> was the major cause of <START:Disease> autonomic neuropathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Isoniazid <END> was the most frequent agent in drug - induced <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Migraine <END> ( 20 % ) was not an uncommon cause of <START:Disease> cranial neuropathy <END> although <START:Disease> malignancies <END> arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent ( 26 % ) .
In 26 . 5 % of all the cases , the aetiology of the <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> was undetermined .
Heredofamilial and <START:Disease> connective tissue disorders <END> were rare .
Some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the <START:Disease> neuropathies <END> are briefly discussed .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin D 3 <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in dairy cows .
Large parenteral doses of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> ( 15 to 17 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) IU <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> ) were associated with prolonged <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> , <START:Disease> hyperphosphatemia <END> , and large increases of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> and its metabolites in the blood plasma of nonlactating nonpregnant and pregnant Jersey cows .
<START:Chemical> Calcium <END> concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> about 32 days prepartum ( 8 . 8 mg / 100 ml ) than in control cows ( 5 . 5 mg / 100 ml ) .
None of the cows treated with <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> showed signs of <START:Disease> milk fever <END> during the peripartal period ; however , 22 % of the control cows developed clinical signs of <START:Disease> milk fever <END> during this period .
Signs of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were not observed in nonlactating nonpregnant cows ; however , pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and 10 of 17 cows died .
There was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that died .
Because of the extreme <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> that prevent <START:Disease> milk fever <END> and doses that induce <START:Disease> milk fever <END> , we concluded that <START:Chemical> vitamin D 3 <END> cannot be used practically to prevent <START:Disease> milk fever <END> when injected several weeks prepartum .
Metabolic involvement in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system .
<START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture .
A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously , and in this study the adenylate energy charge and <START:Chemical> phosphorylcreatine <END> mole fraction were determined in the <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - treated cells .
The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased , while the <START:Chemical> phophorylcreatine <END> mole fraction was unchanged .
Such disparity suggests an inhibition of <START:Chemical> creatine <END> phosphokinase .
The addition of 1 mM <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the <START:Chemical> ATP <END> concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized <START:Chemical> ATP <END> pool .
In the <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - treated cells , the addition of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> increased the adenylate charge and , concomitant with this inrcease , the cells ' functional integrity , in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions , was maintained .
Cardiovascular risk with <START:Chemical> cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> : general problem with substance specific differences ?
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> , <START:Disease> stroke <END> , <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> heart failure <END> during treatment with <START:Chemical> cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> .
Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly , but not exclusively , in patients with concomitant risk factors .
<START:Chemical> Cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> cause complex changes in renal , vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention .
The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time .
A comparison of individual selective and unselective <START:Chemical> cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> suggests substance - specific differences , which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by <START:Chemical> prostaglandin <END> - independent effects .
Diagnostic markers such as <START:Chemical> N - terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NT - proBNP <END> ) or high - sensitive C - reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk , thus avoiding the occurrence of serious <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicity <END> .
Loss of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> decarboxylase mRNA - containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if <START:Chemical> glutamic acid <END> decarboxylase ( GAD ) mRNA - containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to <START:Disease> seizure <END> - induced damage in a model of chronic <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Sprague - Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> , and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 week intervals after <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
In situ hybridization histochemistry , using a <START:Chemical> digoxigenin <END> - labeled GAD cRNA probe , demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals .
Additional neuronanatomical studies , including <START:Chemical> cresyl violet <END> staining , <START:Disease> neuronal degeneration <END> methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to <START:Disease> neuronal loss <END> rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels .
The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer .
Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals .
No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer .
The results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to <START:Disease> seizure <END> - induced damage .
Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of <START:Chemical> GABA <END> neurons .
Role of activation of <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> B 2 receptors in disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood - brain barrier during acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> are not clear .
The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis / release of <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> to activate B 2 receptors in disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Permeability of the blood - brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent - labeled <START:Chemical> dextran <END> before and during <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in rats treated with vehicle and <START:Chemical> Hoe - 140 <END> ( 0 . 1 microM ) .
<START:Chemical> Phenylephrine <END> infusion increased arterial pressure , arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent <START:Chemical> dextran <END> by a similar magnitude in both groups .
These findings suggest that disruption of the blood - brain barrier during acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> is not related to the synthesis / release of <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> to activate B 2 receptors .
Reversal by <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> of the beneficial effects of intravenous <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> in patients with <START:Disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Nitroglycerin <END> has been shown to reduce ST - segment elevation during <START:Disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> , an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> and <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> therapy .
Ten patients with acute transmural <START:Disease> myocardial infarctions <END> received intravenous <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> , sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 + / - 6 to 85 + / - 6 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) , for 60 minutes .
Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 + / - 2 to 11 + / - 2 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
SigmaST , the sum of ST - segment elevations in 16 precordial leads , decreased ( P less than 0 . 02 ) with intravenous <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> .
Subsequent addition of <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> infusion , sufficient to re - elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 + / - 4 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) for 30 minutes , increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 + / - 2 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and also significantly increased sigmaST ( P less than 0 . 05 ) .
Our results suggest that addition of <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> to <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> is not beneficial in the treatment of patients with <START:Disease> acute myocardial infarction <END> .
Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
BACKGROUND : Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short - term follow - up .
METHODS : Forty patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> underwent serial , detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( " off " period ) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( " on " period ) .
All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months ; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year , and 11 at two years .
RESULTS : The percent improvements at six months were as follows : off - period score for overall motor function , 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 38 percent ) , with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs ; off - period score for activities of daily living , 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 39 percent ) ; on - period score for contralateral <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 72 to 91 percent ) ; and on - period score for ipsilateral <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 29 to 59 percent ) .
The improvements in <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> and the total scores for off - period <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> , contralateral <START:Disease> bradykinesia <END> , and <START:Disease> rigidity <END> were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years .
The improvement in ipsilateral <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> was lost after one year , and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months .
Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery .
The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated , and there were no significant changes in the use of medication .
CONCLUSIONS : In late - stage <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , pallidotomy significantly reduces <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> and off - period disability .
Much of the benefit is sustained at two years , although some improvements , such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms , wane within the first year .
The on - period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy .
Passage of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> into the brain around <START:Disease> gliomas <END> : a potential cause of rebound phenomenon .
A study on 21 patients .
AIM : Widespread use of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> to reduce <START:Disease> brain edema <END> and lower <START:Disease> elevated ICP <END> in <START:Disease> brain tumor <END> patients continues to be afflicted by the so - called rebound phenomenon .
Leakage of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound .
This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals .
As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> into the brain after administration to 21 <START:Disease> brain tumor <END> patients .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> Mannitol <END> ( 18 % solution ; 1 g / kg ) was administered as a bolus to patients ( ten had <START:Disease> malignant glioma <END> , seven brain <START:Disease> metastases <END> and four <START:Disease> meningioma <END> ) about 30 minutes before craniotomy .
During resection , a sample of the surrounding <START:Disease> edematous <END> white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample .
<START:Chemical> Mannitol <END> concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al .
RESULTS : In most <START:Disease> glioma <END> patients , <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma ( mean 3 . 5 times ) .
In <START:Disease> meningioma <END> and <START:Disease> metastases <END> patients plasma concentrations of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells .
CONCLUSIONS : The results of our study show that even after a single bolus , <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> may leak through the altered BBB near <START:Disease> gliomas <END> , reversing the initial plasma - to - blood osmotic gradient , aggravating peritumoral <START:Disease> edema <END> and promoting rebound of ICP .
Study of the role of <START:Chemical> vitamin B 12 <END> and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> supplementation in preventing hematologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> .
A prospective , randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of <START:Chemical> vitamin B 12 <END> and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> supplementation in preventing <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ZDV <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> bone marrow suppression <END> .
Seventy - five <START:Disease> human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - infected <END> patients with CD 4 + cell counts < 500 / mm 3 were randomized to receive either <START:Chemical> ZDV <END> ( 500 mg daily ) alone ( group I , n = 38 ) or in combination with <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> ( 15 mg daily ) and intramascular <START:Chemical> vitamin B 12 <END> ( 1000 micrograms monthly ) ( group II , n = 37 ) .
Finally , 15 patients were excluded from the study ( noncompliance 14 , <START:Disease> death <END> 1 ) ; thus , 60 patients ( 31 in group I and 29 in group II ) were eligible for analysis .
No significant differences between groups were found at enrollment .
During the study , <START:Chemical> vitamin B 12 <END> and <START:Chemical> folate <END> levels were significantly higher in group II patients ; however , no differences in hemoglobin , hematocrit , mean corpuscular volume , and white - cell , neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months .
Severe hematologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ( neutrophil count < 1000 / mm 3 and / or hemoglobin < 8 g / dl ) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group I and 7 assigned to group II .
There was no correlation between <START:Chemical> vitamin B 12 <END> or <START:Chemical> folate <END> levels and development of <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin B 12 <END> and <START:Chemical> folinic acid <END> supplementation of <START:Chemical> ZDV <END> therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing <START:Chemical> ZDV <END> - induced <START:Disease> myelotoxicity <END> in the overall treated population , although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded .
Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in <START:Disease> epileptic <END> patients after <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> <START:Disease> overdosages <END> .
The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> medication and <START:Disease> cerebellar atrophy <END> in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication .
Five females and 6 males , 21 - 59 years of age , were examined with a 1 . 5 - T whole - body system using a circular polarized head coil .
Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation .
In addition , we performed a high - resolution 3 D gradient echo , T 1 - weighted sequences at a 1 - mm slice thickness .
The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum .
Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67 . 66 and 131 . 08 ml ( mean 108 . 9 ml ) .
In addition 3 D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age - matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes .
Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between <START:Disease> seizure <END> duration , elevation of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> serum levels and cerebellar volume .
However , multiple regression for the daily dosage , duration of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> <START:Disease> overdosage <END> does not necessarily result in <START:Disease> cerebellar atrophy <END> and it is unlikely that <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> medication was the only cause of <START:Disease> cerebellar atrophy <END> in the remaining patients .
Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> cerebellar disorders <END> .
Development of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> after switch to <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> - based immunosuppression in long - term cardiac transplant patients .
Calcineurin - inhibitor therapy can lead to <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> in heart transplantation patients .
The novel immunosuppressive ( IS ) drug <START:Chemical> sirolmus <END> ( <START:Chemical> Srl <END> ) lacks <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects ; however , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> associated with <START:Chemical> Srl <END> has been reported following renal transplantation .
In cardiac transplantation , the incidence of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> associated with <START:Chemical> Srl <END> is unknown .
In this study , long - term cardiac transplant patients were switched from <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> to <START:Chemical> Srl <END> - based IS .
Concomitant IS consisted of <START:Chemical> mycophenolate mofetil <END> + / - <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0 . 13 g / day ( range 0 - 5 . 7 ) preswitch to 0 . 23 g / day ( 0 - 9 . 88 ) at 24 months postswitch ( p = 0 . 0024 ) .
Before the switch , 11 . 5 % of patients had high - grade <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> ( > 1 . 0 g / day ) ; this increased to 22 . 9 % postswitch ( p = 0 . 006 ) .
<START:Chemical> ACE inhibitor <END> and <START:Chemical> angiotensin - releasing blocker <END> ( <START:Chemical> ARB <END> ) therapy reduced <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> development .
Patients without <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> had increased renal function ( median 42 . 5 vs . 64 . 1 , p = 0 . 25 ) , whereas patients who developed high - grade <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> showed decreased renal function at the end of follow - up ( median 39 . 6 vs . 29 . 2 , p = 0 . 125 ) .
Thus , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to <START:Chemical> Srl <END> , which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients .
<START:Chemical> Srl <END> should be used with <START:Chemical> ACEi <END> / <START:Chemical> ARB <END> therapy and patients monitored for <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and increased <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> .
Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The inferior colliculus ( IC ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system .
Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> microinjection causes freezing , escape - like behavior , and immobility .
However , the nature of this immobility is still unclear .
The present study examined the influence of excitatory <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> - mediated mechanisms in the IC on the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by the <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor blocker <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> administered systemically ( 1 or 0 . 5 mg / kg ) in rats .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor antagonists , <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 15 or 30 mmol / 0 . 5 microl ) and <START:Chemical> AP 7 <END> ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) , or of the <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor agonist <START:Chemical> N - methyl - d - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> , 20 or 30 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) .
The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> and <START:Chemical> AP 7 <END> previous to systemic injections of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> significantly attenuated the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar .
Accordingly , intracollicular microinjection of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> increased the latency to step down the bar .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> - mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and participate in the regulation of motor activity .
<START:Chemical> Acetazolamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Gerstmann syndrome <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> confusion <END> induced by <START:Chemical> acetazolamide <END> is a well known adverse drug reaction in patients with <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> .
We report a case of <START:Chemical> acetazolamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Gerstmann syndrome <END> in a patient with normal renal function , to highlight predisposing factors that are frequently overlooked .
<START:Disease> Chorea <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oral contraception <END> .
Three patients developed <START:Disease> chorea <END> while receiving <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
Two were young patients whose <START:Disease> chorea <END> developed long after treatment had been started and disappeared soon after it had been discontinued .
The third patient had acute <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> chorea <END> after prolonged <START:Chemical> oral contraception <END> .
Prolonged administration of female sex hormones is a possible cause of <START:Disease> chorea <END> in women who have not previously had <START:Disease> chorea <END> or <START:Disease> rheumatic fever <END> .
Severe and long lasting <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> after high - dose <START:Chemical> co - trimoxazole <END> treatment for <START:Disease> Pneumocystis pneumonia <END> in <START:Disease> HIV - infected <END> patients -- a report of two cases .
<START:Disease> Pneumocystis pneumonia <END> ( <START:Disease> PCP <END> ) , a common <START:Disease> opportunistic infection <END> in <START:Disease> HIV - infected <END> individuals , is generally treated with high doses of <START:Chemical> co - trimoxazole <END> .
However , treatment is often limited by adverse effects .
Here , we report two cases of severely immunocompromised <START:Disease> HIV - infected <END> patients who developed severe <START:Disease> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> , and in one patient lesions mimicking <START:Disease> liver abscess <END> formation on radiologic exams , during <START:Chemical> co - trimoxazole <END> treatment for <START:Disease> PCP <END> .
Whereas patient 1 showed lesions of up to 1 cm readily detectable on magnetic resonance imaging under prolonged <START:Chemical> co - trimoxazole <END> treatment , therapy of patient 2 was switched early .
Magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral <START:Disease> venous thrombosis <END> secondary to " low - dose " birth control pills .
The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral <START:Disease> deep venous thrombosis <END> in a 21 - year - old white woman are presented .
This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes .
The only known risk factor was " low - dose " <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> pills .
The magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins , vein of Galen , and straight sinus .
The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography .
Contribution of the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in rostral and intermediate - caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats .
The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone .
Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method , which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance ( MMG ) of the rat ' s hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity ( EMG ) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint : gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior .
<START:Disease> Muscle rigidity <END> was induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) .
<START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - dichlorokynurenic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DCKA <END> ) , a selective <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site antagonist , injected in doses of 2 . 5 and 4 . 5 microg / 0 . 5 microl bilaterally , into the rostral region of the striatum , decreased both the <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> ( MMG ) and the enhanced electromyographic activity ( EMG ) .
<START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DCKA <END> injected bilaterally in a dose of 4 . 5 microg / 0 . 5 microl into the intermediate - caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> had no effect on the muscle tone .
The present results suggest that blockade of the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug .
<START:Chemical> Gemcitabine <END> plus <START:Chemical> vinorelbine <END> in <START:Disease> nonsmall cell lung carcinoma <END> patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> .
Oncopaz Cooperative Group .
BACKGROUND : Although the prevalence of <START:Disease> nonsmall cell lung carcinoma <END> ( <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> ) is high among elderly patients , few data are available regarding the efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of chemotherapy in this group of patients .
Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with <START:Chemical> vinorelbine <END> ( <START:Chemical> VNB <END> ) or <START:Chemical> gemcitabine <END> ( <START:Chemical> GEM <END> ) may obtain a response rate of 20 - 30 % in elderly patients , with acceptable <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and improvement in symptoms and quality of life .
In the current study the efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of the combination of <START:Chemical> GEM <END> and <START:Chemical> VNB <END> in elderly patients with advanced <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> or those with some contraindication to receiving <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> were assessed .
METHODS : Forty - nine patients with advanced <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> were included , 38 of whom were age > / = 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> .
All patients were evaluable for response and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Treatment was comprised of <START:Chemical> VNB <END> , 25 mg / m ( 2 ) , plus <START:Chemical> GEM <END> , 1000 mg / m ( 2 ) , both on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 28 days .
Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected .
RESULTS : One hundred sixty - five courses were administered , with a median of 3 . 6 courses per patient .
The overall response rate was 26 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 15 - 41 % ) .
Two patients attained a complete response ( 4 % ) and 11 patients ( 22 % ) achieved a partial response .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35 % of those patients with an initial value > 0 , whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients ( 55 % ) .
The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1 - year survival rate was 33 % .
<START:Disease> Toxicity <END> was mild .
Six patients ( 12 % ) had World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> , 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 - 4 <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> , and 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Three patients with severe <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> ( 6 % ) died of <START:Disease> sepsis <END> .
The median age of those patients developing Grade 3 - 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients ( 75 years vs . 72 years ; P = 0 . 047 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of <START:Chemical> GEM <END> and <START:Chemical> VNB <END> is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age > / = 75 years .
This age group had an increased risk of <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> .
Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte - colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment .
New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower <START:Disease> toxicity <END> are needed for elderly patients with advanced <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
Open - label assessment of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> for the treatment of acute bacterial <START:Disease> sinusitis <END> in adults .
PURPOSE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> ( 500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days ) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial <START:Disease> sinusitis <END> .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers .
All patients had a pre - therapy Gram ' s stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy .
Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results .
Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s ) .
RESULTS : The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Moraxella catarrhalis .
Of 300 clinically evaluable patients , 175 ( 58 % ) were cured and 90 ( 30 % ) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation , resulting in a clinical success rate of 88 % .
Thirty - five patients ( 12 % ) clinically failed treatment .
The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented ) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92 % .
Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented ) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93 % ( M .
catarrhalis ) to 100 % ( S . pneumoniae ) at the post - therapy visit .
All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post - therapy returned for a long - term follow - up visit ; 243 ( 92 % ) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy ; and 21 ( 8 % ) had a relapse of symptoms .
Adverse events considered to be related to <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> administration were reported by 29 patients ( 9 % ) .
The most common drug - related adverse events were <START:Disease> diarrhea <END> , <START:Disease> flatulence <END> , and <START:Disease> nausea <END> ; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity .
CONCLUSION : The results of this study indicate that <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial <START:Disease> sinusitis <END> .
Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral <START:Chemical> prostacyclin <END> analogue <START:Chemical> beraprost <END> and phosphodiesterase inhibitor <START:Chemical> cilostazol <END> .
Among various oral antiplatelets , a combination of a novel <START:Chemical> prostacyclin <END> analogue <START:Chemical> beraprost <END> ( <START:Chemical> BPT <END> ) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor <START:Chemical> cilostazol <END> ( <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular <START:Chemical> cAMP <END> ( <START:Chemical> cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate <END> ) .
Thereby , a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted .
Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take <START:Chemical> BPT <END> / <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> in the following schedule ; <START:Chemical> BPT <END> : 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t . i . d . from day 7 to 14 , <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> : 200 mg t . i . d . from day 3 to 14 .
At various time intervals , physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> and determination of intraplatelet <START:Chemical> cAMP <END> were performed .
Throughout the observation period , no significant alteration in vital signs was observed .
Seven out of 12 subjects experienced <START:Disease> headache <END> of a short duration accompanying <START:Disease> facial flush <END> in one and <START:Disease> nausea <END> in one , especially after ingestion of <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> .
All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required .
Intraplatelet <START:Chemical> cAMP <END> content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / - 4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / - 2 . 25 pmol ) .
The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted .
In conclusion , the combined administration of <START:Chemical> BPT <END> / <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated .
A developmental analysis of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ' s effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats .
Under controlled conditions , infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha ( 2 ) adrenoceptor agonist , <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
Previous investigations have determined that , in response to <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , ultrasound production increases through the 2 nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter .
Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> induces sympathetic withdrawal and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , we hypothesized that <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ' s developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other .
Therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> administration ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2 - , 8 - , 15 - , and 20 - day - old rats .
Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ' s detrimental effects on cardiovascular function .
Tolerance and antiviral effect of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> in patients with <START:Disease> Argentine hemorrhagic fever <END> .
Tolerance and antiviral effect of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> was studied in 6 patients with <START:Disease> Argentine hemorrhagic fever <END> ( <START:Disease> AHF <END> ) of more than 8 days of evolution .
Administration of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> resulted in a neutralization of <START:Disease> viremia <END> and a drop of endogenous interferon titers .
The average time of <START:Disease> death <END> was delayed .
A reversible <START:Disease> anemia <END> was the only adverse effect observed .
From these results , we conclude that <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of <START:Disease> AHF <END> , and that <START:Disease> anemia <END> , the only secondary reaction observed , can be easily managed .
The possible beneficial effect of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> during the initial days of <START:Disease> AHF <END> is discussed .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxic <END> effects in high - risk patients undergoing angiography .
BACKGROUND : The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
Whether iso - osmolar contrast medium is less <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> than low - osmolar contrast medium in high - risk patients is uncertain .
METHODS : We conducted a randomized , double - blind , prospective , multicenter study comparing the <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects of an iso - osmolar , dimeric , nonionic contrast medium , <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> , with those of a low - osmolar , nonionic , monomeric contrast medium , <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> .
The study involved 129 patients with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> with serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentrations of 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography .
The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration during the three days after angiography .
Other end points were an increase in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , and a change in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration from day 0 to day 7 .
RESULTS : The <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration increased significantly less in patients who received <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> .
From day 0 to day 3 , the mean peak increase in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> was 0 . 13 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group and 0 . 55 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( P = 0 . 001 ; the increase with <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> minus the increase with <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> , - 0 . 42 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 73 to - 0 . 22 ] ) .
Two of the 64 patients in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group ( 3 percent ) had an increase in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( 26 percent ) ( P = 0 . 002 ; odds ratio for such an increase in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group , 0 . 09 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 02 to 0 . 41 ] ) .
No patient receiving <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> had an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , but 10 patients in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( 15 percent ) did .
The mean change in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0 . 07 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group and 0 . 24 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( P = 0 . 003 ; value in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group minus the value in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group , - 0 . 17 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 07 ] ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Nephropathy <END> induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high - risk patients when <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> is used rather than a low - osmolar , nonionic contrast medium .
The relationship between hippocampal <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal <START:Disease> seizure <END> - prone and withdrawal <START:Disease> seizure <END> - resistant selected mouse lines .
BACKGROUND : The septo - hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis , and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents , but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> withdrawal severity .
Thus , the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> withdrawal severity .
METHODS : Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - na ve Withdrawal <START:Disease> Seizure <END> - Prone ( WSP ) and - Resistant ( WSR ) mice .
Animals were administered <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> , <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> , or <START:Chemical> neostigmine <END> via timed tail vein infusion , and the latencies to onset of <START:Disease> tremor <END> and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose .
We also used microdialysis to measure basal and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - stimulated <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ACh <END> ) release in the CA 1 region of the hippocampus .
<START:Chemical> Potassium <END> was applied by reverse dialysis twice , separated by 75 min .
Hippocampal <START:Chemical> ACh <END> also was measured during testing for handling - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
RESULTS : Sensitivity to several <START:Disease> convulsion <END> endpoints induced by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> , <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> , and <START:Chemical> neostigmine <END> were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice .
In microdialysis experiments , the lines did not differ in basal release of <START:Chemical> ACh <END> , and 50 mM <START:Chemical> KCl <END> increased <START:Chemical> ACh <END> output in both lines of mice .
However , the increase in release of <START:Chemical> ACh <END> produced by the first application of <START:Chemical> KCl <END> was 2 - fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice .
When hippocampal <START:Chemical> ACh <END> was measured during testing for handling - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> , extracellular <START:Chemical> ACh <END> was significantly elevated ( 192 % ) in WSP mice , but was nonsignificantly elevated ( 59 % ) in WSR mice .
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic <START:Disease> convulsants <END> may be associated with <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> withdrawal .
Specifically , WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic <START:Disease> convulsants <END> compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons .
Long - term effects of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> on the peripheral nervous system .
Forty patients with <START:Disease> Non - Hodgkin ' s Lymphoma <END> treated with <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> between 1984 and 1990 ( cumulative dose 12 mg in 18 - 24 weeks ) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> on the peripheral nervous system .
The patients were interviewed with emphasis on <START:Disease> neuropathic symptoms <END> .
Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed , four to 77 months ( median 34 months ) after <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> treatment .
Twenty - seven patients reported <START:Disease> neuropathic symptoms <END> .
In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination .
In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated .
In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past .
Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy .
There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination .
Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients .
Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term .
It is concluded that with the above mentioned <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> dose schedule signs and symptoms of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good .
Intraocular pressure in patients with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> fluocinolone acetonide <END> implants .
OBJECTIVE : To report the incidence and management of <START:Disease> elevated intraocular pressure <END> ( IOP ) in patients with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> treated with the <START:Chemical> fluocinolone acetonide <END> ( <START:Chemical> FA <END> ) intravitreal implant .
DESIGN : Pooled data from 3 multicenter , double - masked , randomized , controlled , phase 2 b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0 . 59 - mg or 2 . 1 - mg <START:Chemical> FA <END> intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed .
RESULTS : During the 3 - year follow - up , 71 . 0 % of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55 . 1 % , 24 . 7 % , and 6 . 2 % of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more , 40 mm Hg or more , and 50 mm Hg or more , respectively .
Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74 . 8 % of implanted eyes , and IOP - lowering surgeries , most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76 . 2 % ) , were performed on 36 . 6 % of implanted eyes .
Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication ) in 85 . 1 % of eyes at 1 year .
The rate of <START:Disease> hypotony <END> ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg ) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( P = . 09 ) .
CONCLUSION : Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery .
The attenuating effect of <START:Chemical> carteolol hydrochloride <END> , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats .
It is known that beta - adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment .
Neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , a model of neuroleptic - induced extrapyramidal side effects , was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> in humans , although neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> .
Therefore , the effects of <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> and <START:Chemical> biperiden <END> , a muscarinic receptor antagonist .
<START:Chemical> Carteolol <END> , as well as <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> and <START:Chemical> biperiden <END> , inhibited the <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The inhibitory effect of <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> was almost comparable to that of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , but was weaker than that of <START:Chemical> biperiden <END> .
<START:Chemical> Carteolol <END> did not evoke postsynaptic <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and <START:Disease> hyperlocomotion <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Carteolol <END> did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> on <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats .
In addition , <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> did not evoke 5 - HT 1 A receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptophan <END> - induced head twitch in rats .
Finally , <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> did not inhibit <START:Chemical> physostigmine <END> - induced lethality in rats .
These results strongly suggest that <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> improves <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> via its beta - adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> without attenuating neuroleptic - induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor antagonistic activity .
Dose - related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> on <START:Chemical> organophosphorus <END> - induced delayed <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> in chickens .
<START:Chemical> Tri - ortho - tolyl phosphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> ) , 360 mg / kg , po , and <START:Chemical> 0 , 0 ' - diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFP <END> ) , 1 mg / kg sc , were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> .
Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> appeared .
Although low concentrations ( less than or equal to 50 ppm ) of <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> had beneficial effects on <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> - induced <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> , greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxic <END> esterase activities 24 hr after <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> were less than 20 % of values measured in chickens not given <START:Chemical> organophosphorous <END> compounds .
Chickens given 200 ppm <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> without <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase .
<START:Disease> Degenerating myelinated fibers <END> were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cholesteryl hemisuccinate <END> treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> , <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> , <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> , <START:Chemical> chloroform <END> and <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> .
In addition to its use as a stabilizer / rigidifier of membranes , <START:Chemical> cholesteryl hemisuccinate <END> , <START:Chemical> tris salt <END> ( <START:Chemical> CS <END> ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> CCl 4 <END> ) .
To further our understanding of the mechanism of <START:Chemical> CS <END> cytoprotection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of <START:Chemical> CS <END> and the non - hydrolyzable ether form of <START:Chemical> CS <END> , <START:Chemical> gamma - cholesteryloxybutyric acid <END> , <START:Chemical> tris salt <END> ( <START:Chemical> CSE <END> ) against <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> - , <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - , <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> - , <START:Chemical> chloroform <END> - and <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The results of these studies demonstrated that <START:Chemical> CS <END> - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical .
A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of <START:Chemical> CS <END> ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) , resulted in significant protection against the <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> CCl 4 <END> , <START:Chemical> CHCl 3 <END> , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> and <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> and against the lethal ( and presumably <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> ) effect of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> administration .
Maximal <START:Chemical> CS <END> - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> CS <END> intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death .
The mechanism of <START:Chemical> CS <END> protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> ) .
However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that <START:Chemical> CS <END> administration inhibits chemical bioactivation .
Our findings do suggest that <START:Chemical> CS <END> - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic <START:Chemical> CS <END> molecule ( non - hydrolyzable <START:Chemical> CSE <END> was as protective as <START:Chemical> CS <END> ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .
Protective effect of <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> against <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> vestibulotoxicity <END> in the guinea pig .
This study investigated alleviation of <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> vestibulotoxicity <END> by <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> in guinea pigs .
<START:Chemical> Edaravone <END> , a free radical scavenger , has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat <START:Disease> cerebral infarction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Streptomycin <END> was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h , and <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> ( n = 8 ) or saline ( n = 6 ) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 days .
We observed horizontal vestibulo - ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function .
Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> suppresses <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> vestibulotoxicity <END> .
Protective effect of <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> on <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> induced <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> in elderly patients .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the possible protective effects of <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> .
METHODS : Forty - five hospitalized elderly patients ( > 65 years old ) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) were randomly assigned to receive either <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> , 150 mg / day ( Group A ) , or <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> 150 mg / day plus <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> at 0 . 6 mg / day ( Group B ) .
Laboratory variables of renal function [ serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , <START:Chemical> blood urea nitrogen <END> ( <START:Chemical> BUN <END> ) and electrolytes ] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days , until termination of the study ( a period of at least 6 days ) .
Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of <START:Disease> pain <END> .
RESULTS : Forty - two patients completed the study , 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B .
<START:Chemical> BUN <END> and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> increased by > 50 % of baseline levels in 54 and 45 % of Group A patients , respectively , compared to only 20 and 10 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Potassium <END> ( <START:Chemical> K <END> ) increment of 0 . 6 mEq / l or more was observed in 50 % of Group A , but in only 15 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
The mean increments in <START:Chemical> BUN <END> , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , and <START:Chemical> K <END> were reduced by 63 , 80 , and 42 % , respectively , in Group B patients compared to Group A .
Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups .
CONCLUSION : Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> related <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> .
Addition of <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> can minimize this <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> without affecting <START:Disease> pain <END> control .
Long - term <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> supplementation failed to protect against <START:Disease> peripheral neurotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> .
Toxic <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAC <END> ) , although <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and its closely related <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> <START:Chemical> glutamine <END> were claimed to ameliorate <START:Chemical> PAC <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> supplementation for preventing <START:Chemical> PAC <END> - induced <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> in a randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blinded clinical and electro - diagnostic study .
Forty - three <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same <START:Chemical> PAC <END> - containing regimen : 23 had been supplemented by <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> all along the treatment period , at a daily dose of three times 500 mg ( group G ) , and 20 had received a placebo ( group P ) .
Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations , questionnaires and sensory - motor nerve conduction studies .
There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G .
However , this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported <START:Disease> pain <END> sensation ( P = 0 . 011 ) .
Also the frequency of abnormal electro - diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups ( G : 7 / 23 = 30 . 4 % ; P : 6 / 20 = 30 % ) .
This pilot study leads to the conclusion that <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against <START:Disease> peripheral neurotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> PAC <END> .
Experimental <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> : risk of concomitant chemotherapy .
The role of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CSA <END> ) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> was evaluated in rats .
Administration of 20 mg / kg / day <START:Chemical> CSA <END> for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man .
The combined administration of <START:Chemical> CSA <END> and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> potential , such as <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ( at therapeutic doses ) , <START:Chemical> amphothericin B <END> and <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> , which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients , did not aggravate the <START:Chemical> CSA <END> induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in the rat model .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin <END> at toxic doses , however , increased <START:Chemical> CSA <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
Thus , the <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> CSA <END> has a different pathogenetic mechanism .
Influence of <START:Chemical> smoking <END> on developing cochlea .
Does <START:Chemical> smoking <END> during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns ?
OBJECTIVE : Maternal tobacco <START:Chemical> smoking <END> has negative effects on fetal growth .
The influence of <START:Chemical> smoking <END> during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated , although <START:Chemical> smoking <END> has been positively associated with <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> in adults .
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal <START:Chemical> smoking <END> on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( TEOAEs ) of healthy neonates .
METHODS : This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for <START:Disease> hearing impairment <END> and involved both ears of 200 newborns .
Newborns whose mothers reported <START:Chemical> smoking <END> during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears ) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears ) , whose mothers were non - smokers .
Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low ( < 5 cigarettes per day , n = 88 ears ) , moderate ( 5 < or = cigarettes per day < 10 , n = 76 ) or high ( > or = 10 cigarettes per day , n = 36 ) .
RESULTS : In exposed neonates , TEOAEs mean response ( across frequency ) and mean amplitude at 4000 Hz was significantly lower than in non - exposed neonates .
Comparisons between exposed newborns ' subgroups revealed no significant differences .
However , by comparing each subgroup to control group , we found statistically significant <START:Disease> decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes <END> at 4000 Hz for all three groups .
Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group .
CONCLUSION : In utero , exposure to tobacco <START:Chemical> smoking <END> seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells .
These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns , regardless of the degree of exposure .
Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal <START:Chemical> smoking <END> on the neonate ' s hearing acuity .
Extrapyramidal side effects and oral <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> : an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics .
The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
The incidence of <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> was higher at higher doses of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> and in younger patients .
Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients .
However , these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> developed .
<START:Disease> Akathisia <END> was controlled by the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> <START:Chemical> lorazepam <END> in 14 out of 16 patients , while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective .
The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
Elevation of ADAM 10 , ADAM 17 , MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 expression with media degeneration features <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> thoracic aortic aneurysm <END> in a rat model .
PURPOSE : This study was designed to establish a rat model of <START:Disease> thoracic aortic aneurysm <END> ( <START:Disease> TAA <END> ) by <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 <END> )) - induced <START:Disease> arterial injury <END> and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase ( ADAM ) , matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) and their endogenous inhibitors ( TIMPs ) in <START:Disease> TAA <END> formation .
METHODS : Thoracic aorta of male Sprague - Dawley rats was exposed to 0 . 5 M <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> or normal saline ( <START:Chemical> NaCl <END> ) .
After 12 weeks , animals were euthanized , and <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - treated , <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - untreated ( n = 12 ) and <START:Chemical> NaCl <END> - treated aortic segments ( n = 12 ) were collected for histological and molecular assessments .
MMP - TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi - quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry .
RESULTS : Despite similar external diameters among <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - treated , non - <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - treated and <START:Chemical> NaCl <END> - treated segments , aneurymal alteration ( n = 6 , 50 % ) , media degeneration with regional disruption , fragmentation of elastic fiber , and increased collagen deposition ( n = 12 , 100 % ) were demonstrated in <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - treated segments .
MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 mRNA levels were increased in <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - treated segments ( all p < 0 . 01 ) , with trends of elevation in <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - untreated segments , as compared with <START:Chemical> NaCl <END> - treated segments .
Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 ( all p < 0 . 01 ) in intima and media for <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> - treated segments .
TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments .
CONCLUSION : This study establishes a <START:Disease> TAA <END> model by periarterial <START:Chemical> CaCl ( 2 ) <END> exposure in rats , and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM 10 and ADAM 17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling .
The epidemiology of the acute <START:Disease> flank pain <END> syndrome from <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> .
<START:Chemical> Suprofen <END> , a new nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent .
Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute <START:Disease> flank pain <END> syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system , 700 , 000 persons used the drug in the United States .
Through August 1986 , a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported .
To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome , a case - control study was performed , comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> - exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome .
Case patients were more likely to be men ( odds ratio , 3 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 2 - 12 . 1 ) , suffer from <START:Disease> hay fever <END> and <START:Disease> asthma <END> ( odds ratio , 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 0 - 11 . 9 ) ; to participate in regular exercise ( odds ratio , 5 . 9 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 30 . 7 ) , especially in the use of Nautilus equipment ( p = 0 . 02 ) ; and to use <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> ( odds ratio , 4 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 17 . 5 ) .
Possible risk factors included young age , concurrent use of other analgesic agents ( especially <START:Chemical> ibuprofen <END> ) , preexisting <START:Disease> renal disease <END> , a history of <START:Disease> kidney stones <END> , a history of <START:Disease> gout <END> , a recent increase in activity , a recent increase in sun exposure , and residence in the Sunbelt .
These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance .
These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome : acute diffuse crystallization of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> in renal tubules .
<START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> : a novel selective <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity .
<START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> is a novel selective <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonist .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> ( 2 . 5 , 10 . 0 and 30 . 0 mg / kg ) significantly ameliorated the <START:Disease> cataleptic <END> responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> CGS 21680 <END> ( 10 micrograms ) , in a dose - dependent manner .
<START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> also reduced the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 1 mg / kg i . p . ) and by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> ( 5 mg / kg i . p . ) .
These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0 . 625 and 2 . 5 mg / kg p . o . , respectively .
Moreover , <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> ( 0 . 625 mg / kg p . o . ) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of <START:Chemical> L - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> ; 25 mg / kg i . p . ) plus <START:Chemical> benserazide <END> ( 6 . 25 mg / kg i . p . ) .
These results suggested that <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> is a centrally active <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonists .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> may be a useful drug in the treatment of <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> .
Changes in heart size during long - term <START:Chemical> timolol <END> treatment after <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
The effect of long - term <START:Chemical> timolol <END> treatment on heart size after <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> was evaluated by X - ray in a double - blind study including 241 patients ( placebo 126 , <START:Chemical> timolol <END> 115 ) .
The follow - up period was 12 months .
The <START:Chemical> timolol <END> - treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group .
These differences may be caused by <START:Chemical> timolol <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and a compensatory increase in end - diastolic volume .
The <START:Chemical> timolol <END> - related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size .
In patients with <START:Disease> cardiomegaly <END> , the increase in heart size was similar in both groups .
After re - <START:Disease> infarction <END> , heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the <START:Chemical> timolol <END> group .
Intra - arterial <START:Chemical> BCNU <END> chemotherapy for treatment of <START:Disease> malignant gliomas <END> of the central nervous system .
Because of the rapid systemic clearance of <START:Chemical> BCNU <END> ( <START:Chemical> 1 , 3 - bis - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 1 - nitrosourea <END> ) , intra - arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of <START:Disease> malignant gliomas <END> .
Thirty - six patients were treated with <START:Chemical> BCNU <END> every 6 to 8 weeks , either by transfemoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intracarotid drug delivery system , beginning with a dose of 200 mg / sq m body surface area .
Twelve patients with Grade III or IV <START:Disease> astrocytomas <END> were treated after partial resection of the <START:Disease> tumor <END> without prior radiation therapy .
After two to seven cycles of chemotherapy , nine patients showed a decrease in <START:Disease> tumor <END> size and surrounding <START:Disease> edema <END> on contrast - enhanced computerized tomography scans .
In the nine responders , median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks ( range 12 to more than 91 weeks ) .
The median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks ( range 21 to more than 156 weeks ) , with an 18 - month survival rate of 42 % .
Twenty - four patients with recurrent Grade I to IV <START:Disease> astrocytomas <END> , whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed , received two to eight courses of intra - arterial <START:Chemical> BCNU <END> therapy .
Seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks ( range 6 to more than 66 weeks ) .
The catheterization procedure is safe , with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of <START:Chemical> BCNU <END> .
A delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral <START:Disease> loss of vision <END> secondary to a <START:Disease> retinal vasculitis <END> .
The frequency of <START:Disease> visual loss <END> decreased after the concentration of the <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> diluent was lowered .
Explicit episodic memory for sensory - discriminative components of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> pain <END> : immediate and delayed ratings .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> memory is thought to affect future <START:Disease> pain <END> sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical <START:Disease> pain <END> conditions .
Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental <START:Disease> pain <END> are sparse .
In order to address long - term <START:Disease> pain <END> memory , nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> ( 0 . 05 , 1 and 20 microg , separated by 15 min breaks ) , each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 - 100 ) digitized at 1 / s , either immediately online or one hour or one day after injection .
Subjects also recalled their <START:Disease> pains <END> one week later .
<START:Chemical> Capsaicin <END> injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p < 0 . 001 ) without any difference within or across sessions .
The strong burning <START:Disease> pain <END> decayed exponentially within a few minutes .
Subjects were able to reliably discriminate <START:Disease> pain <END> magnitude and duration across <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> doses ( both p < 0 . 001 ) , regardless of whether first - time ratings were requested immediately , after one hour or after one day .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude : p < 0 . 01 , duration : p < 0 . 05 ) .
Correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first - time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( R ( 2 ) = 0 . 79 ) indicating that both rating retrievals utilized similar memory traces .
These results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced <START:Disease> pain <END> .
The data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage , and may take up to one day .
<START:Disease> Myasthenia gravis <END> caused by <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> and <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> therapy for <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We have described a unique patient who had reversible and dose - related <START:Disease> myasthenia gravis <END> after <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> and <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> therapy for <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Although <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor antibodies were not detectable , the time course was consistent with an autoimmune process .
Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery .
Injections of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a <START:Disease> depression <END> of the SA nodal activity by a direct action .
This <START:Disease> depression <END> was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase .
Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> , while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta - blocking agent into the SA node artery .
This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> injected in the SA node artery .
Blockade of both D - 1 and D - 2 <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors may induce <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in mice .
1 . The <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> antagonists has been tested and the possible <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> subtypes involved in <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> was determined .
2 .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> , D - 1 antagonist <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> or D - 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The effect of <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> and <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> was dose - dependent .
Combination of <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> with <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> did not induce <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> potentiation .
3 .
D - 1 agonist <START:Chemical> SKF 38393 <END> or D - 2 agonist <START:Chemical> quinpirole <END> decreased the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> , <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> or <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> .
4 .
Combination of <START:Chemical> SKF 38393 <END> with <START:Chemical> quinpirole <END> did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> antagonists .
5 .
The data may indicate that although D - 2 receptor blockade is involved in <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , the D - 1 receptor may plan a role .
Noradrenergic involvement in <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol <END> .
In order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the cataleptogenic effect of <START:Chemical> delta 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol <END> ( <START:Chemical> THC <END> ) , the effect of pretreatment with <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> ) or with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> and <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rats .
The cataleptogenic effect of <START:Chemical> THC <END> was significantly reduced in rats treated with <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> and <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> , as compared with control rats .
On the contrary , the cataleptogenic effect of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> was significantly reduced in rats treated with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> and <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> but not in rats treated with <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> or in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus .
These results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> THC <END> , whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
Less frequent <START:Chemical> lithium <END> administration and lower urine volume .
OBJECTIVE : This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> on a once - per - day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day .
METHOD : This was a cross - sectional study of 85 patients from a <START:Chemical> lithium <END> clinic who received different dose schedules .
Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> level , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance , urine volume , and maximum osmolality .
RESULTS : Multiple daily doses of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> were associated with higher urine volumes .
The dosing schedule , duration of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment , and daily dose of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> did not affect maximum osmolality or <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance .
CONCLUSIONS : Urine volume can be reduced by giving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> once daily and / or by lowering the total daily dose .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects .
Effect of intravenous <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> or intravenous <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> plus glucagon on <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> on <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress testing with <START:Chemical> technetium - 99 m sestamibi <END> single - photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST - segment monitoring , and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> ' s effects .
DESIGN : Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
SETTING : Community hospital .
PATIENTS : Twenty - two patients with known reversible perfusion defects .
INTERVENTION : Patients underwent <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress tests per standard protocol .
Before <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> was begun , no therapy was given during the first visit , and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> or <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> plus glucagon 1 mg . <START:Chemical> Metoprolol <END> was dosed to achieve a resting <START:Chemical> predobutamine <END> heart rate below 65 beats / minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Metoprolol <END> reduced maximum heart rate 31 % , summed stress scores 29 % , and summed difference scores 43 % versus control .
<START:Chemical> Metoprolol <END> plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29 % versus control .
Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced , although they were 18 % and 30 % lower , respectively , than control .
No significant differences were found in any parameter between <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> - glucagon .
CONCLUSION : During <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress testing , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> attenuates or eliminates evidence of <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
Glucagon 1 mg , although somewhat effective , does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically .
Recurrent use of newer <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> and the risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> .
The epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> ( <START:Disease> VTE <END> ) associated with newer <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> ( <START:Chemical> OC <END> ) did not distinguish between patterns of <START:Chemical> OC <END> use , namely first - time users , repeaters and switchers .
Data from a Transnational case - control study were used to assess the risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> for the latter patterns of use , while accounting for duration of use .
Over the period 1993 - 1996 , 551 cases of <START:Disease> VTE <END> were identified in Germany and the UK along with 2066 controls .
Totals of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 622 controls for switching patterns .
The adjusted rate ratio of <START:Disease> VTE <END> for repeat users of third generation <START:Chemical> OC <END> was 0 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 3 - 1 . 2 ) relative to repeat users of second generation pills , whereas it was 1 . 3 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 7 - 2 . 4 ) for switchers from second to third generation pills relative to switchers from third to second generation pills .
We conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of <START:Disease> VTE <END> when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pills .
These analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer <START:Chemical> OC <END> in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use .
Rat extraocular muscle regeneration .
Repair of local anesthetic - induced damage .
Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery ( 0 . 75 % <START:Chemical> bupivacaine hydrochloride <END> , 2 . 0 % <START:Chemical> mepivacaine hydrochloride <END> , and 2 . 0 % <START:Chemical> lidocaine hydrochloride <END> plus 1 : 100 , 000 <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes .
Controls were injected with physiological saline .
All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles .
<START:Disease> Muscle degeneration <END> is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers .
In addition to <START:Disease> muscle damage <END> , severe damage was also seen in harderian glands , especially after exposure to <START:Chemical> mepivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> plus <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> .
With these findings in rats , it is hypothesized that the temporary <START:Disease> diplopia <END> sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic - induced damage to the extraocular muscles .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> sedation for the reduction of children ' s <START:Disease> fractures <END> in the emergency department .
BACKGROUND : There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> , a unique anesthetic , for emergency - department procedures requiring sedation .
The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> for sedation in the treatment of children ' s <START:Disease> fractures <END> in the emergency department .
METHODS : One hundred and fourteen children ( average age , 5 . 3 years ; range , twelve months to ten years and ten months ) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated <START:Disease> fracture <END> or <START:Disease> dislocation <END> in the emergency department at a level - I <START:Disease> trauma <END> center were prospectively evaluated .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine hydrochloride <END> was administered intravenously ( at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in ninety - nine of the patients and intramuscularly ( at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight ) in the other fifteen .
A board - certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic , and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse .
Any <START:Disease> pain <END> during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario <START:Disease> Pain <END> Scale ( CHEOPS ) .
RESULTS : The average time from intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> to manipulation of the <START:Disease> fracture <END> or <START:Disease> dislocation <END> was one minute and thirty - six seconds ( range , twenty seconds to five minutes ) , and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty - two seconds ( range , sixty seconds to fifteen minutes ) .
The average score according to the Children ' s Hospital of Eastern Ontario <START:Disease> Pain <END> Scale was 6 . 4 points ( range , 5 to 10 points ) , reflecting minimal or no <START:Disease> pain <END> during <START:Disease> fracture <END> reduction .
Adequate <START:Disease> fracture <END> reduction was obtained in 111 of the children .
Ninety - nine percent ( sixty - eight ) of the sixty - nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation .
Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients .
Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable .
Minor side effects included <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( thirteen patients ) , <START:Disease> emesis <END> ( eight of the thirteen patients with <START:Disease> nausea <END> ) , <START:Disease> clumsiness <END> ( evident as <START:Disease> ataxic movements <END> in ten patients ) , and <START:Disease> dysphoric reaction <END> ( one patient ) .
No long - term sequelae were noted , and no patients had <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> or nightmares .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> reliably , safely , and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children ' s <START:Disease> fractures <END> in the emergency department at our institution .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department , where proper one - on - one monitoring is used and board - certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient .
Protection against <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> toward striatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> neurons in rodents by <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> , an excitatory <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> antagonist .
<START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> , <START:Chemical> 3 SR , 4 aRS , 6 SR , 8 aRS - 6 - [ phosphonomethyl ] decahydr oisoquinoline - 3 - carboxylic acid <END> , has been described as a potent antagonist of the <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) subtype of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptor .
Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> in the striatum by <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> in <START:Chemical> iprindole <END> - treated rats is reported .
A single 18 . 4 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose of ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> hemisulfate , given to rats pretreated with <START:Chemical> iprindole <END> , resulted in persistent depletion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> in the striatum 1 week later .
This prolonged depletion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> in the striatum was antagonized by <START:Chemical> dizocilpine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> , a non - competitive antagonist of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors ) or by <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> ( a competitive antagonist of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors ) .
The protective effect of <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> was dose - dependent , being maximum at 10 - 40 mgkg ( i . p . ) .
A 10 mg / kg dose of <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> was effective in antagonizing the depletion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> in the striatum , when given as long as 8 hr prior to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> but not when given 24 hr prior to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
Depletion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> in the striatum was also antagonized when <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> was given after the injection of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> ; <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
The prolonged depletion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> in the striatum in mice , given multiple injections of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> , was also antagonized dose - dependently and completely by <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> .
The data strengthen the evidence that the <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> and related compounds toward nigrostriatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> neurons involves <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors and that <START:Chemical> LY 274614 <END> is an <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor antagonist with long - lasting in vivo effects in rats .
In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> in the rat .
In <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> in the rat , detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered .
Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by <START:Disease> cystitis <END> was presently investigated .
Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic , adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists .
Generally , <START:Chemical> atropine <END> reduced contractions , but in contrast to controls , it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz ) in inflamed preparations .
In both types , purinoceptor desensitization with <START:Chemical> alpha , beta - methylene adenosine - 5 ' - triphosphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> alpha , beta - meATP <END> ) caused further reductions at low frequencies ( < 10 Hz ) .
The muscarinic receptor antagonists <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , <START:Chemical> 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 4 - DAMP <END> ) ( ' M ( 1 ) / M ( 3 ) / M ( 5 ) - selective ' ) , <START:Chemical> methoctramine <END> ( ' M ( 2 ) - selective ' ) and <START:Chemical> pirenzepine <END> ( ' M ( 1 ) - selective ' ) antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component .
<START:Chemical> 4 - DAMP <END> inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than <START:Chemical> methoctramine <END> and <START:Chemical> pirenzepine <END> .
In inflamed preparations , the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation - evoked contraction was decreased and the <START:Chemical> pirenzepine <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - DAMP <END> antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls .
In contrast to controls , <START:Chemical> methoctramine <END> increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies .
While contractions to <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> ATP <END> were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference <START:Chemical> potassium <END> response , <START:Chemical> isoprenaline <END> - induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips .
Thus , in <START:Disease> cystitis <END> substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur .
While postjunctional beta - adrenoceptor - mediated relaxations are reduced , effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased .
Effects of the cyclooxygenase - 2 specific inhibitor <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events in patients with <START:Disease> arthritis <END> .
There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events may be higher with cyclooxygenase ( COX ) - 2 - specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
We evaluated cardiovascular event data for <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> , a new COX - 2 - specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials .
The incidence of cardiovascular <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events ( cardiac , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular , or arterial <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> ) was determined by analyzing pooled <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> ( 10 - 80 mg daily ) , nonselective NSAID ( <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> 75 mg bid , <START:Chemical> ibuprofen <END> 800 mg tid , or <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> trials that were 6 - 52 weeks in duration .
The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients ( n = 7934 ) and in users of low - dose ( < or = 325 mg daily ) <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( n = 1051 ) and nonusers of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( n = 6883 ) .
Crude and exposure - adjusted incidences of <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events were similar for <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> , NSAIDs , and placebo .
The risk of serious <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events was also similar for each <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> dose .
<START:Disease> Thrombotic <END> risk was consistently higher for users of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> users than nonusers of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( placebo , 1 . 4 % vs . 0 % ; <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> , 1 . 7 % vs . 0 . 2 % ; NSAIDs , 1 . 9 % vs . 0 . 5 % ) .
The rates of events in users of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> doses .
Short - and intermediate - term treatment with therapeutic ( 10 or 20 mg daily ) and supratherapeutic ( 40 or 80 mg daily ) <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> doses was not associated with an increased incidence of <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> patients in controlled clinical trials .
<START:Chemical> Capsaicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle pain <END> alters the excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex .
The pathophysiology of painful <START:Disease> temporomandibular disorders <END> is not fully understood , but evidence suggests that <START:Disease> muscle pain <END> modulates motor function in characteristic ways .
This study tested the hypothesis that activation of <START:Disease> nociceptive muscle <END> afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw - stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stretch .
<START:Chemical> Capsaicin <END> ( 10 micro g ) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce <START:Disease> pain <END> in 11 healthy volunteers .
Short - latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and temporalis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before , during , and after the <START:Disease> pain <END> .
The normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement , but remained constant with different displacements at a given velocity .
The normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during <START:Disease> pain <END> , but only at faster stretches in the <START:Disease> painful muscle <END> .
Increased sensitivity of the fusimotor system during acute <START:Disease> muscle pain <END> could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings .
Calcitonin gene - related peptide levels during <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> - induced <START:Disease> headache <END> in patients with chronic <START:Disease> tension - type headache <END> .
It has been proposed that <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) induced <START:Disease> headache <END> in <START:Disease> primary headaches <END> may be associated with release of calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) .
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during <START:Disease> headache <END> induced by the <START:Chemical> NO <END> donor <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> GTN <END> ) in 16 patients with chronic <START:Disease> tension - type headache <END> and 16 healthy controls .
The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0 . 5 microg / kg / min <START:Chemical> GTN <END> or placebo over 20 min on two <START:Disease> headache <END> - free days .
Blood samples were collected at baseline , 10 , 20 and 60 min after start of infusion .
Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate <START:Disease> headache <END> on the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> day than on the placebo day and the <START:Disease> headache <END> was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls .
There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve ( AUCCGRP ) on <START:Chemical> GTN <END> vs . placebo day in either patients ( P = 0 . 65 ) or controls ( P = 0 . 48 ) .
The AUCCGRP recorded on the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> day did not differ between patients and controls ( P = 0 . 36 ) .
Both in patients and controls , CGRP levels changed significantly over time , on both the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> and placebo days ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
The present study indicates that <START:Chemical> NO <END> - induced immediate <START:Disease> headache <END> is not associated with release of CGRP .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced oromandibular <START:Disease> dystonia <END> in <START:Disease> progressive supranuclear palsy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> have been reported in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> and <START:Disease> multiple system atrophy <END> .
Cranial <START:Disease> dystonias <END> are rare in patients with <START:Disease> progressive supranuclear palsy <END> ( <START:Disease> PSP <END> ) .
In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> Oromandibular dystonia <END> ( <START:Disease> OMD <END> ) in a <START:Disease> PSP <END> patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of <START:Disease> PSP <END> , and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology .
<START:Disease> Cerebral infarction <END> with a single oral dose of <START:Chemical> phenylpropanolamine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) , a synthetic sympathomimetic that is structurally similar to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> , is available over the counter in anorectics , nasal congestants , and cold preparations .
Its prolonged use or overuse has been associated with <START:Disease> seizures <END> , <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> , <START:Disease> neuropsychiatric symptoms <END> , and nonhemorrhagic <START:Disease> cerebral infarction <END> .
We report the case of a young woman who suffered a <START:Disease> cerebral infarction <END> after taking a single oral dose of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> .
Contribution of <START:Chemical> sodium valproate <END> to the <START:Disease> syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone <END> .
We report the case of a 62 - year - old man who was administered <START:Chemical> sodium valproate <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) and who subsequently developed the <START:Disease> syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone <END> ( <START:Disease> SIADH <END> ) .
He had been taking <START:Chemical> VPA <END> for treatment of idiopathic generalized <START:Disease> tonic - clonic convulsions <END> since he was 56 years old .
After substituting <START:Chemical> VPA <END> with <START:Chemical> zonisamide <END> , the serum <START:Chemical> sodium <END> level returned to normal .
We consider this episode of <START:Disease> SIADH <END> to be the result of a combination of factors including a <START:Disease> weakness of the central nervous system <END> and the long - term administration of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> .
Potential deleterious effect of <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> in radiocontrast <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
18 patients , referred to a radiocontrast study , considered at risk because of preexisting <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> , were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , controlled trial , performed at the secondary care center of a 1 , 100 - bed private university hospital .
In addition to fluids , the treatment group received <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> ( mean dose 110 mg ) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material .
The control group received fluids ( mean 3 liters ) .
Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non - ionic contrast material , at an average dose of 245 ml .
<START:Disease> Renal function significantly deteriorated <END> in the group pretreated with <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> ( p < 0 . 005 by ANOVA ) , with a rise in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> from 145 + / - 13 to 182 + / - 16 mumol / l at 24 h , while no change occurred in the control group ( from 141 + / - 6 to 142 + / - 7 mumol / l ) .
<START:Disease> Renal failure <END> was associated with <START:Disease> weight loss <END> in the <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> - treated group .
<START:Chemical> Furosemide <END> may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
Morphological features of <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> after chronic administration of the antiepileptic drug <START:Chemical> valproate <END> to rats .
A transmission electron microscopic study of capillaries in the cerebellar cortex .
Long - term intragastric application of the antiepileptic drug <START:Chemical> sodium valproate <END> ( Vupral " Polfa " ) at the effective dose of 200 mg / kg b . w . once daily to rats for 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months revealed <START:Disease> neurological disorders <END> indicating <START:Disease> cerebellum damage <END> ( " <START:Chemical> valproate <END> <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> " ) .
The first ultrastructural changes in structural elements of the blood - brain - barrier ( BBB ) in the cerebellar cortex were detectable after 3 months of the experiment .
They became more severe in the later months of the experiment , and were most severe after 12 months , located mainly in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex .
Lesions of the capillary included <START:Disease> necrosis <END> of endothelial cells .
Organelles of these cells , in particular the mitochondria ( increased number and size , distinct degeneration of their matrix and cristae ) and Golgi apparatus were altered .
Reduced size of capillary lumen and occlusion were caused by swollen endothelial cells which had <START:Chemical> luminal <END> protrusions and swollen microvilli .
Pressure on the vessel wall was produced by enlarged perivascular astrocytic processes .
Fragments of <START:Disease> necrotic <END> endothelial cells were in the vascular lumens and in these there was loosening and breaking of tight cellular junctions .
Damage to the vascular basement lamina was also observed .
Damage to the capillary was accompanied by marked damage to neuroglial cells , mainly to perivascular processes of astrocytes .
The proliferation of astrocytes ( Bergmann ' s in particular ) and occasionally of oligodendrocytes was found .
Alterations in the structural elements of the BBB coexisted with marked lesions of neurons of the cerebellum ( Purkinje cells are earliest ) .
In electron micrographs both <START:Chemical> luminal <END> and antiluminal sides of the BBB of the cerebellar cortex had similar lesions .
The possible influence of the <START:Disease> hepatic damage <END> , mainly <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> , upon the development of <START:Chemical> valproate <END> <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> is discussed .
Potential therapeutic use of the selective <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 1 receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> : an acute study in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - primed monkeys .
The clinical utility of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) D 1 receptor agonists in the treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) is still unclear .
The therapeutic use of selective <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 receptor agonists such as <START:Chemical> SKF - 82958 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - chloro - 7 , 8 - dihydroxy - 3 - allyl - 1 - phenyl - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrahydro - 1 H - 3 - benzaze pine hydrobromide <END> ) and <START:Chemical> A - 77636 <END> ( <START:Chemical> [ 1 R , 3 S ] 3 - [ 1 ' - admantyl ] - 1 - aminomethyl - 3 , 4 - dihydro - 5 , 6 - dihydroxy - 1 H - 2 - benzo pyran hydrochloride <END> ) seems limited because of their duration of action , which is too short for <START:Chemical> SKF - 82958 <END> ( < 1 hr ) and too long for <START:Chemical> A - 77636 <END> ( > 20 hr , leading to behavioral tolerance ) .
We therefore conducted the present acute dose - response study in four <START:Chemical> 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> ) - exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> to evaluate the locomotor and <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> effects on challenge with four doses ( from 0 . 03 to 1 . 0 mg / kg ) of <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> ( <START:Chemical> [ - ] - [ 5 aR , 11 bS ] - 4 , 5 , 5 a , 6 , 7 , 11 b - hexahydro - 2 - propyl - 3 - thia - 5 - + ++ azacyclopent - 1 - ena [ c ] phenathrene - 9 - 10 - diol <END> ) , a selective and full <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 - like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> and the <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 2 - like receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> LY - 171555 <END> ( <START:Chemical> [ 4 aR - trans ] - 4 , 4 a , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 8 a , 9 - o - dihydro - 5 n - propyl - 2 H - pyrazo lo - 3 - 4 - quinoline hydrochloride <END> ) were also used for comparison .
Acute administration of <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> was as efficacious in alleviating <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> as <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and <START:Chemical> LY - 171555 <END> , but was less likely to reproduce the <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in these animals than with either <START:Chemical> LY - 171555 <END> or subsequent challenge of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> .
Selective stimulation of the <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus ( referred to as the basal ganglia output ) compared with <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and selective <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 2 receptor agonist .
Potent <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> ( approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested ) are potential therapeutic tools in <START:Disease> PD <END> and merit further attention .
Fatal <START:Disease> myeloencephalopathy <END> due to accidental intrathecal <START:Chemical> vincristin <END> administration : a report of two cases .
We report on two fatal cases of accidental intrathecal <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> instillation in a 5 - year old girl with recurrent <START:Disease> acute lymphoblastic leucemia <END> and a 57 - year old man with <START:Disease> lymphoblastic lymphoma <END> .
The girl died seven days , the man four weeks after intrathecal injection of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> .
Clinically , the onset was characterized by the signs of <START:Disease> opistothonus , sensory and motor dysfunction <END> and ascending <START:Disease> paralysis <END> .
Histological and immunohistochemical investigations ( HE - LFB , CD - 68 , Neurofilament ) revealed <START:Disease> degeneration of myelin and axons <END> as well as <START:Disease> pseudocystic transformation <END> in areas exposed to <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> , accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages .
The clinical course and histopathological results of the two cases are presented .
A review of all reported cases in the literature is given .
A better controlled regimen for administering <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> and intrathecal chemotherapy is recommended .
Prenatal exposure to <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> induces <START:Disease> fetal pulmonary hypertension <END> in the rat .
RATIONALE : <START:Chemical> Fluoxetine <END> is a selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women .
Epidemiological data suggest that <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension syndrome <END> of the newborn .
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension <END> protective <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> effect in adult rodents .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate .
METHODS : Pregnant rats were treated with <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section .
As compared with controls , <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> exposure resulted in <START:Disease> fetal pulmonary hypertension <END> as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum ( P = 0 . 02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals , and arterial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> saturation was 96 + / - 1 % in 1 - day - old control animals and significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) in <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> - exposed pups ( 79 + / - 2 % ) .
In vitro , <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal , but not adult , animals ( P < 0 . 01 ) and reduced <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> - induced contraction at both ages ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
After in utero exposure to a low <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal , but not adult , cells ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the adult , <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> exposure in utero induces <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension <END> in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation .
Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger <START:Chemical> ribonucleic acid <END> levels , prolactin signaling , and <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemic <END> inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> .
<START:Disease> Hyperprolactinemia <END> can reduce fertility and libido .
Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly understood .
We first tested whether chronic <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile LH secretion and the <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - induced LH surge .
Chronic <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> induced by the <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> caused a 40 % reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sulpiride <END> did not affect the magnitude of a <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge .
<START:Chemical> Estradiol <END> is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R ) and components of prolactin ' s signaling pathway .
To test the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT 5 activation .
Lastly , we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling ) mRNAs in response to <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> and <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sulpiride <END> induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area , where GnRH neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels were also induced .
<START:Chemical> Estradiol <END> enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS .
Interestingly , <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> also induced PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels independently .
These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in a <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - dependent manner .
They also provide evidence for <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> - dependent and brain region - specific regulation of PRL - R expression and signaling responses by prolactin .
A case of massive <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> following <START:Chemical> molindone <END> administration .
<START:Disease> Rhabdomyolysis <END> is a potentially lethal syndrome that <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> patients seem predisposed to develop .
The clinical signs and symptoms , typical laboratory features , and complications of <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> are presented .
The case of a <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patient is reported to illustrate massive <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> and subsequent <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> following <START:Chemical> molindone <END> administration .
Physicians who prescribe <START:Chemical> molindone <END> should be aware of this reaction .
Severe reversible <START:Disease> left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction <END> due to accidental iatrogenic <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
<START:Chemical> Catecholamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> due to chronic excess of endogenous <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomenon .
In contrast , reports of <START:Disease> myocardial dysfunction <END> due to acute iatrogenic <START:Disease> overdose <END> are rare .
A 35 - year - old woman whose cervix uteri was inadvertently injected with 8 mg of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> developed <START:Disease> myocardial stunning <END> that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise , profound , albeit transient , <START:Disease> left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction <END> , and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of <START:Disease> myocardial necrosis <END> .
Our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision .
The effects of <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> on <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
The influence of <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> on <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> was studied in cats .
The <START:Disease> convulsive <END> threshold ( mean + / - SD ) was 41 . 4 + / - 6 . 5 mg . l ( - 1 ) with <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> infusion ( 6 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . min ( - 1 )) , increasing significantly to 66 . 6 + / - 10 . 9 mg . l ( - 1 ) when the end - tidal concentration of <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> was 0 . 8 % .
However , the threshold ( 61 . 6 + / - 8 . 7 mg . l ( - 1 )) during 1 . 6 % <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> was not significant from that during 0 . 8 % <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> , indicating a celling effect .
There was no significant difference in the <START:Disease> convulsive <END> threshold between <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> .
The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> or <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> were administered and the blood pressure at <START:Disease> convulsions <END> decreased significantly in 1 . 6 % <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> , and in 0 . 8 % and 1 . 6 % <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> .
However , there was no significant difference in the <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg .
<START:Chemical> Apamin <END> , a selective blocker of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> - dependent <START:Chemical> potassium <END> channels , was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0 . 8 % <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects .
<START:Chemical> Apamin <END> ( 10 ng ) had a tendency to decrease the <START:Disease> convulsive <END> threshold ( 21 . 6 + / - 2 . 2 to 19 . 9 + / - 2 . 5 mg . l ( - 1 )) but this was not statistically significant .
It is suggested that <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> reduces the <START:Disease> convulsive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> but carries some risk due to circulatory <START:Disease> depression <END> .
Recurarization in the recovery room .
A case of recurarization in the recovery room is reported .
Accumulation of <START:Chemical> atracurium <END> in the intravenous line led to recurarization after flushing the line in the recovery room .
A <START:Disease> respiratory arrest <END> with severe <START:Disease> desaturation <END> and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> occurred .
Circumstances leading to this event and the mechanisms enabling a <START:Disease> neuromuscular blockade <END> to occur , following the administration of a small dose of relaxant , are discussed .
Swallowing - induced <START:Disease> atrial tachyarrhythmia <END> triggered by <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> : case report and review of the literature .
CASE : A 49 - year - old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing .
On electrocardiogram , episodes of <START:Disease> atrial tachyarrhythmia <END> were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 - hour Holter monitoring recorded several events .
The <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> resolved after therapy with <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> , but recurred a year later .
The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> .
After stopping the beta - agonist , and after a week with the <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> , the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> disappeared .
DISCUSSION : Swallowing - induced <START:Disease> atrial tachyarrhythmia <END> ( <START:Disease> SIAT <END> ) is a rare phenomenon .
Fewer than 50 cases of <START:Disease> SIAT <END> have been described in the literature .
This article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to <START:Disease> SIAT <END> .
It discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , postulated mechanisms of <START:Disease> SIAT <END> , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Salbutamol <END> is presented here as a possible trigger for <START:Disease> SIAT <END> .
Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> ( known to induce <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it .
Impact of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures .
BACKGROUND : More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973 ) reported on the devastation caused by <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> exposure on fetal development , the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged .
Early identification of fetal <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes .
This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - related fetal <START:Disease> growth impairment <END> .
METHODS : We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> intervention study .
The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies .
Because intensity of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day ) <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumers .
Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics .
Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and <START:Disease> drug abuse <END> .
RESULTS : Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies .
When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - exposed group , regardless of prior drinking patterns .
Any <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in <START:Disease> reduced cerebellar growth <END> as well as <START:Disease> decreased cranial to body growth <END> in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers .
<START:Chemical> Amphetamine <END> abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios .
CONCLUSIONS : Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies .
Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> effects .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> activity with <START:Chemical> imipenem <END> therapy : incidence and risk factors .
Two elderly patients with a history of either <START:Disease> cerebral vascular accident <END> ( <START:Disease> CVA <END> ) or <START:Disease> head trauma <END> and no evidence of <START:Disease> renal disease <END> developed <START:Disease> seizures <END> while receiving maximum doses of <START:Chemical> imipenem / cilastatin <END> .
Neither patient had reported previous <START:Disease> seizures <END> or <START:Disease> seizure <END> - like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents .
All <START:Disease> seizures <END> were controlled with therapeutic doses of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> .
Both patients had received maximum doses of other <START:Chemical> beta - lactam <END> antibiotics without evidence of <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity .
Etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> liver tumors <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
Within the last several years , previously rare <START:Disease> liver tumors <END> have been seen in young women using <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
The Registry for <START:Disease> Liver Tumors <END> Associated with <START:Chemical> Oral Contraceptives <END> at the University of California , Irvine , has clearly identified 27 cases .
The recent literature contains 44 case reports .
Common to these 71 cases has been a histopathologic diagnosis of <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> , <START:Disease> adenoma <END> , <START:Disease> hamartoma <END> , and <START:Disease> hepatoma <END> .
Significant statistical etiologic factors include prolonged uninterrupted usage of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
Eight deaths and liver <START:Disease> rupture <END> in 18 patients attest to the seriousness of this new potentially lethal adverse phenomenon .
Subjective assessment of <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> of patients on long - term administration of <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> .
Various data suggest that male patients who have received <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> and decreased levels of plasma <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .
This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long - term administration of <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> therapy and sexual behavior , and the effect of <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> on plasma levels of <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> , <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> , and LH .
The patients of the study and control group ( without <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> ) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age ( 25 - 40 years ) and were randomly selected from the <START:Disease> rheumatic heart disease <END> patients .
A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out , using parameters such as sexual desire , sexual excitement , and frequency of sexual relations .
Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior .
The findings support the reports concerning <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> effect on plasma <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> , <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> , and LH .
The differences in the means were significant .
Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant <START:Disease> decrease in sexual desire <END> , sexual excitement phase ( erection ) , and frequency of sexual relations in the study group .
Complete <START:Disease> atrioventricular block <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Sinus node dysfunction <END> has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> .
In the present case , complete <START:Disease> atrioventricular ( AV ) block <END> with <START:Disease> syncopal attacks <END> developed secondary to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy , necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation .
Serum <START:Chemical> lithium <END> levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the <START:Disease> syncopal attacks <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> should be used with extreme caution , especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction .
Behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> in patients with <START:Disease> panic disorder <END> and <START:Disease> agoraphobia <END> .
The effects of oral doses of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg / day for 2 weeks ) and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> ( single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg / day for 2 weeks ) on psychological performance of patients with <START:Disease> panic disorders <END> and <START:Disease> agoraphobia <END> were investigated in a double - blind , randomized and crossover design .
Both drugs <START:Disease> impaired immediate free recall <END> but the decrease was greater for <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> than <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> .
<START:Disease> Delayed free recall was also impaired <END> but the two drugs did not differ .
Patients tapped faster after <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> than <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> and they were more sedated after <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> than <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> .
After 2 weeks of treatment , patients tested 5 - 8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance .
These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects .
Accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged <START:Disease> behavioral impairment <END> .
<START:Disease> Hepatic veno - occlusive disease <END> caused by <START:Chemical> 6 - thioguanine <END> .
Clinically reversible <START:Disease> veno - occlusive disease of the liver <END> developed in a 23 - year - old man with <START:Disease> acute lymphocytic leukemia <END> after 10 months of maintenance therapy with <START:Chemical> 6 - thioguanine <END> .
Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement .
Although this disease was clinically reversible , some subintimal <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> about the terminal hepatic veins persisted .
This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible <START:Disease> hepatic veno - occlusive disease <END> over time , and may be the first case of veno - occlusive related solely to <START:Chemical> 6 - thioguanine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> after liver transplantation .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Unfractionated heparin sodium <END> ( <START:Chemical> UFH <END> ) or <START:Chemical> low - molecular weight heparin <END> ( LMWH ) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> after liver transplantation .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ( <START:Disease> HIT <END> ) is an adverse immune - mediated reaction to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50 % .
The frequencies of <START:Disease> HIT <END> after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4 / <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - reactive antibody ( <START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody ) positivity in liver transplantation patients , however , are unknown .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation .
We started LMWH ( 25 IU / kg / h ) on postoperative day ( POD ) 1 , switching to <START:Chemical> UFH <END> ( 5000 U / d ) on POD 2 or 3 .
The dose of <START:Chemical> UFH <END> was changed according to the activated clotting time level .
<START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14 .
Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks .
RESULTS : The average platelet counts preoperatively , and on POD 7 , 14 , and 21 were 65 , 88 , 149 , and 169 x 10 ( 9 ) / L , respectively .
Two patients developed hepatic artery <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> on POD 11 and 19 , respectively , although they were <START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody - negative and their platelet counts were stable .
In 2 other patients , the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 9 , respectively .
The <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> test was negative in these patients .
The percentage of <START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody - positive patients was 0 . 5 % preoperatively , 5 . 6 % on POD 7 , and 5 . 6 % on POD 14 .
None of the subjects / patients developed <START:Chemical> UFH <END> - related <START:Disease> HIT <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : In our series , the occurrence of <START:Disease> HIT <END> after liver transplantation was uncommon .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> reverses the antihypertensive effect of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
In unanesthetized , spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by <START:Chemical> nalozone <END> , 0 . 2 to 2 mg / kg .
The <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> effect of 100 mg / kg <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> was also partially reversed by <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate .
In brain membranes from spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 5 ) M , did not influence stereoselective binding of <START:Chemical> [ 3 H ] - naloxone <END> ( 8 nM ) , and <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 4 ) M , did not influence <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> - suppressible binding of <START:Chemical> [ 3 H ] - dihydroergocryptine <END> ( 1 nM ) .
These findings indicate that in spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats the effects of central alpha - adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors .
As <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> and <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> or <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone .
<START:Chemical> Lamivudine <END> for the prevention of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> virus reactivation in <START:Chemical> hepatitis - B surface antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBSAG <END> ) seropositive <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> virus ( HBV ) is one of the major causes of chronic <START:Disease> liver disease <END> worldwide .
<START:Disease> Cancer <END> patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher <START:Disease> hepatic complication <END> rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy ( CT ) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation .
In this study , <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients who have solid and <START:Disease> hematological malignancies <END> with chronic <START:Disease> HBV infection <END> received the antiviral agent <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> prior and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> .
The objectives were to assess the efficacy of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation , and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT .
Two groups were compared in this study .
The prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudin <END> group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> treatment .
The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> .
They were followed up during and for 8 weeks after CT .
The outcomes were compared for both groups .
Of our control group ( n = 50 ) , 21 patients ( 42 % ) were established <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Twelve ( 24 % ) of them were evaluated as severe <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
In the prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> group severe <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> were observed only in 1 patient ( 2 . 7 % ) of 37 patients ( p < 0 . 006 ) .
Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase ( ALT ) values in the control group than the prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> group ; 154 : 64 ( p < 0 . 32 ) .
Our study suggests that prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy .
Further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate <START:Chemical> nucleoside <END> or <START:Chemical> nucleotide <END> analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during CT and the optimal duration of administration after completion of CT .
Interaction of <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> with antineoplastic agents .
A synergistic effect of <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> was observed in a patient with <START:Disease> acute T - lymphocytic leukemia <END> in relapse .
The concomitant administration of <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> resulted in eradication of hitherto refractory <START:Disease> leukemic infiltration <END> of bone marrow .
Severe side effects in terms of mental <START:Disease> confusion <END> and progressive <START:Disease> hyperbilirubinemia <END> , however , point to an enhancement not only of antineoplastic effects but also of <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in normal tissues .
This report demonstrates for the first time that the pharmacodynamic properties of <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> may not be confined strictly to suppression of normal T - cell functions .
Co - <START:Disease> carcinogenic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> retinyl acetate <END> on <START:Disease> forestomach carcinogenesis <END> of male F 344 rats induced with <START:Chemical> butylated hydroxyanisole <END> .
The potential modifying effect of <START:Chemical> retinyl acetate <END> ( <START:Chemical> RA <END> ) on <START:Chemical> butylated hydroxyanisole <END> ( <START:Chemical> BHA <END> ) - induced rat <START:Disease> forestomach tumorigenesis <END> was examined .
Male F 344 rats , 5 weeks of age , were maintained on diet containing 1 % or 2 % <START:Chemical> BHA <END> by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with <START:Chemical> RA <END> at various concentrations ( w / v ) for 52 weeks .
In groups given 2 % <START:Chemical> BHA <END> , although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals , co - administration of 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> RA <END> significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) increased the incidence of <START:Disease> forestomach tumors <END> ( <START:Disease> squamous cell papilloma <END> and <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> ) to 60 % ( 9 / 15 , 2 rats with <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> ) from 15 % ( 3 / 20 , one rat with <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> ) in the group given <START:Chemical> RA <END> - free water .
In rats given 1 % <START:Chemical> BHA <END> , <START:Chemical> RA <END> co - administered at a dose of 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 or 0 . 25 % showed a dose - dependent enhancing effect on the development of the <START:Chemical> BHA <END> - induced <START:Disease> epithelial hyperplasia <END> .
<START:Disease> Tumors <END> , all <START:Disease> papillomas <END> , were induced in 3 rats ( 17 % ) with 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> RA <END> and in one rat ( 10 % ) with 0 . 05 % <START:Chemical> RA <END> co - administration .
<START:Chemical> RA <END> alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach .
These findings indicate that <START:Chemical> RA <END> acted as a co - carcinogen in the <START:Chemical> BHA <END> <START:Disease> forestomach carcinogenesis <END> of the rat .
A measure of <START:Disease> pupillary oscillation <END> as a marker of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> paranoia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> paranoia <END> ( <START:Disease> CIP <END> ) remains an important drug - induced model of idiopathic <START:Disease> paranoia <END> for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged .
Measures of <START:Disease> pupillary oscillation <END> were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent <START:Chemical> crack cocaine <END> abusers endorsing past <START:Disease> CIP <END> ( n = 32 ) from another group of <START:Chemical> crack <END> addicts who denied past <START:Disease> CIP <END> ( n = 29 ) .
<START:Chemical> Propylthiouracil <END> - induced perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody - positive <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> in conjunction with <START:Disease> pericarditis <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To describe a case of <START:Chemical> propylthiouracil <END> - induced <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> manifesting with <START:Disease> pericarditis <END> .
METHODS : We present the first case report of a woman with <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> treated with <START:Chemical> propylthiouracil <END> in whom a syndrome of <START:Disease> pericarditis <END> , <START:Disease> fever <END> , and <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> developed .
Serologic testing and immunologic studies were done , and a pericardial biopsy was performed .
RESULTS : A 25 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> Graves ' disease <END> had a <START:Disease> febrile illness <END> and evidence of <START:Disease> pericarditis <END> , which was confirmed by biopsy .
Serologic evaluation revealed the presence of perinuclear - staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies ( pANCA ) against myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) .
<START:Chemical> Propylthiouracil <END> therapy was withdrawn , and she was treated with a 1 - month course of <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> , which alleviated her symptoms .
A literature review revealed no prior reports of <START:Disease> pericarditis <END> in anti - MPO pANCA - positive <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> associated with <START:Chemical> propylthio - uracil <END> therapy .
CONCLUSION : <START:Disease> Pericarditis <END> may be the initial manifestation of drug - induced <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> attributable to <START:Chemical> propylthio - uracil <END> therapy .
<START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> - induced autophagic cardiomyocyte <START:Disease> death <END> plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : The mechanisms underlying <START:Disease> heart failure <END> induced by <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> are very complicated and still unclear .
The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> induced by <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> , so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> 3 - methyladenine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 MA <END> ) , a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a <START:Disease> heart failure <END> model of rats induced by <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> .
Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague - Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls , an <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - treated group , and a <START:Chemical> 3 MA <END> plus <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - treated group .
We then examined the morphology , expression of beclin 1 gene , mitochondrial permeability transition ( MPT ) , and Na + - <START:Chemical> K <END> + ATPase activity in vivo .
We also assessed cell viability , mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes .
In addition , we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene , beclin 1 using RT - PCR and Western blotting in an animal model .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> 3 MA <END> significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles , and <START:Chemical> 3 MA <END> strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles .
CONCLUSION : Autophagic cardiomyocyte <START:Disease> death <END> plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> in rats induced by <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> .
Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> caused by <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> via the autophagy pathway .
Effect of <START:Chemical> polyethylene glycol 400 <END> on <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in mice .
The effect of a widely used organic solvent , <START:Chemical> polyethylene glycol 400 <END> ( <START:Chemical> PEG 400 <END> ) , on the toxic action of an acute or chronic treatment with <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ) was evaluated in mice .
<START:Chemical> PEG 400 <END> impressively decreased both acute high - dose and chronic low - dose - <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - associated lethality .
Light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac morphological alterations <END> .
Such treatment did not diminish the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> antitumor activity in <START:Disease> L 1210 leukemia <END> and in <START:Disease> Ehrlich ascites tumor <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> related <START:Disease> chest pain <END> : are we seeing the tip of an iceberg ?
The recreational use of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> is on the increase .
The emergency nurse ought to be familiar with some of the cardiovascular consequences of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
In particular , the tendency of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> to produce <START:Disease> chest pain <END> ought to be in the mind of the emergency nurse when faced with a young victim of <START:Disease> chest pain <END> who is otherwise at low risk .
The mechanism of <START:Disease> chest pain <END> related to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use is discussed and treatment dilemmas are discussed .
Finally , moral issues relating to the testing of potential <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> users will be addressed .
A catch in the <START:Disease> Reye <END> .
Twenty - six cases of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> from The Children ' s Hospital , Camperdown , Australia , occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed .
Of these , 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Aspirin <END> or <START:Chemical> salicylate <END> ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases ( 5 % ) , and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ) had been administered in only six of the cases ( 30 % ) .
Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> was accomplished in 90 % of the cases .
The incidence of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> in New South Wales , Australia , is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain .
The mortality for these <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> cases in Australia was 45 % as compared with a 32 % case - fatality rate in the United States .
In Australia , the pediatric usage of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> has been extremely low for the past 25 years ( less than 1 % of total dosage units sold ) , with <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market .
<START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with <START:Chemical> salicylates <END> or <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ingestion , since there were no cases found at The Children ' s Hospital in 1983 , 1984 , or 1985 .
<START:Disease> Valvular heart disease <END> in patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> treated with <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> .
Course following treatment modifications .
<START:Disease> Valvular heart abnormalities <END> have been reported in patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) treated with <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> .
However , the incidence and severity of these abnormalities vary from study to study and their course after drug withdrawal has not been systematically assessed .
OBJECTIVES : To estimate the frequency and severity of <START:Disease> valvular heart abnormality <END> and its possible reversibility after drug withdrawal in a case - control study .
METHODS : All <START:Disease> PD <END> patients in the Amiens area treated with <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> were invited to attend a cardiologic assessment including transthoracic echocardiography .
Thirty <START:Disease> PD <END> patients participated in the study .
A second echocardiography was performed ( median interval : 13 months ) after <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> withdrawal ( n = 10 patients ) .
Controls were age - and sex - matched non - <START:Disease> PD <END> patients referred to the cardiology department .
RESULTS : Compared to controls , <START:Disease> aortic regurgitation <END> ( OR : 3 . 1 ; 95 % IC : 1 . 1 - 8 . 8 ) and <START:Disease> mitral regurgitation <END> ( OR : 10 . 7 ; 95 % IC : 2 . 1 - 53 ) were more frequent in <START:Disease> PD <END> patients ( tricuspid : NS ) .
The number of affected valves ( n = 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 7 ) and the sum of regurgitation grades ( n = 2 . 8 + / - 1 . 09 ) were higher ( p = 0 . 008 and p = 0 . 006 , respectively ) in the <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> group .
Severity of regurgitation was not correlated with <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> cumulative dose .
A restrictive pattern of <START:Disease> valvular regurgitation <END> , suggestive of the role of <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> , was observed in 12 / 30 ( 40 % ) patients including two with <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pergolide <END> was discontinued in 10 patients with <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> , resulting in a lower regurgitation grade ( p = 0 . 01 ) at the second transthoracic echocardiography and the two patients with <START:Disease> heart failure <END> returned to nearly normal clinical examination .
This study supports the high frequency of restrictive <START:Disease> valve regurgitation <END> in <START:Disease> PD <END> patients treated with <START:Chemical> pergolide <END> and reveals that a significant improvement is usual when the treatment is converted to non - ergot <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> agonists .
<START:Chemical> Nimodipine <END> prevents <START:Disease> memory impairment <END> caused by <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in adult mice .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hypotension <END> and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of <START:Disease> cognitive dysfunction <END> .
We tested the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> ( <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> ) administered at the onset of <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> ( <START:Chemical> NTG <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> would preserve long - term associative memory .
METHODS : The passive avoidance ( PA ) paradigm was used to assess memory retention .
For PA training , latencies ( seconds ) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered .
Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial .
Ninety - six Swiss - Webster mice ( 30 - 35 g , 6 - 8 wk ) , were randomized into 6 groups 1 ) saline ( control ) , 2 ) <START:Chemical> NTG <END> immediately after learning , 3 ) <START:Chemical> NTG <END> 3 h after learning , 4 ) <START:Chemical> NTG <END> and <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> , 5 ) vehicle , and 6 ) <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> alone .
The extent of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and changes in brain tissue oxygenation ( PbtO ( 2 )) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals .
RESULTS : All groups exhibited similar training latencies ( 17 . 0 + / - 4 . 6 s ) .
Mice subjected to <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time ( 178 + / - 156 s ) compared with those injected with saline , <START:Chemical> NTG <END> + <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> , or delayed <START:Chemical> NTG <END> ( 580 + / - 81 s , 557 + / - 67 s , and 493 + / - 146 s , respectively ) .
A Kruskal - Wallis 1 - way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups ( H = 15 . 34 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies , the same dose of <START:Chemical> NTG <END> ( n = 3 ) and <START:Chemical> NTG <END> + <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> ( n = 3 ) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85 . 9 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg sem to 31 . 6 + / - 0 . 8 mm Hg sem and from 86 . 2 + / - 3 . 7 mm Hg sem to 32 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 mm Hg sem , respectively .
Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> alone decreased from 88 . 1 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg to 80 . 0 + / - 2 . 9 mm Hg .
The intergroup difference was statistically significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
PbtO ( 2 ) decreased from 51 . 7 + / - 4 . 5 mm Hg sem to 33 . 8 + / - 5 . 2 mm Hg sem in the <START:Chemical> NTG <END> group and from 38 . 6 + / - 6 . 1 mm Hg sem to 25 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg sem in the <START:Chemical> NTG <END> + <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> groups , respectively .
There were no significant differences among groups .
CONCLUSION : In a PA retention paradigm , the injection of <START:Chemical> NTG <END> immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long - term associative memory in mice , whereas delayed induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> had no effect .
<START:Chemical> NIMO <END> attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long - term memory caused by <START:Chemical> NTG <END> but did not improve latency in the absence of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The observed effect of <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> may have been attributable to the preservation of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> homeostasis during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , because there were no differences in the PbtO ( 2 ) indices among groups .
Acute changes of blood <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> may predict short - term adverse effects of <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Valproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) was given to 24 <START:Disease> epileptic <END> patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs .
A standardized loading dose of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> was administered , and venous blood was sampled at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 hours .
<START:Chemical> Ammonia <END> ( <START:Chemical> NH 3 <END> ) was higher in patients who , during continuous therapy , complained of <START:Disease> drowsiness <END> ( 7 patients ) than in those who were symptom - free ( 17 patients ) , although <START:Chemical> VPA <END> plasma levels were similar in both groups .
By measuring <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - induced changes of blood <START:Chemical> NH 3 <END> content , it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when <START:Chemical> VPA <END> is given chronically .
Therapeutic drug monitoring of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> : once - daily versus twice - daily dosage schedules .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen ( once - daily vs . twice - daily ) of <START:Chemical> tobramicyn <END> on steady - state serum concentrations and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Patients undergoing treatment with i . v . <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> ( 4 mg / kg / day ) were randomised to two groups .
Group OD ( n = 22 ) received a once - daily dose of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and group TD ( n = 21 ) received the same dose divided into two doses daily .
<START:Chemical> Tobramycin <END> serum concentrations ( peak and trough ) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay .
The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before , during and immediately after treatment .
RESULTS : The two groups were comparable with respect to sex , age , body weight and renal function .
No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose , duration of treatment , or cumulative dose .
Trough concentrations were < 2 g / ml in the two groups ( 100 % ) .
Peak concentrations were > 6 microg / ml in 100 % of the OD group and in 67 % of the TD group ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
Mean peak concentrations were markedly different : 11 . 00 + / - 2 . 89 microg / ml in OD vs . 6 . 53 + / - 1 . 45 microg / ml in TD ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
The pharmacokinetics parameters were : Ke , ( 0 . 15 + / - 0 . 03 / h in OD vs . 0 . 24 + / - 0 . 06 / h in TD ) , t 1 / 2 , ( 4 . 95 + / - 1 . 41 h in OD vs . 3 . 07 + / - 0 . 71 h in TD ) , Vd ( 0 . 35 + / - 0 . 11 l / kg in OD vs . 0 . 33 + / - 0 . 09 l / kg in TD ) , Cl ( 0 . 86 + / - 0 . 29 ml / min / kg in OD vs . 1 . 28 + / - 0 . 33 ml / min / kg in TD ) .
Increased serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> was observed in 73 % of patients in OD versus 57 % of patients in TD , without evidence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
In TD group , three patients developed <START:Disease> decreased auditory function <END> , of which one presented with an <START:Disease> auditory loss <END> of - 30 dB , whereas in the OD group only one patient presented <START:Disease> decreased auditory function <END> .
CONCLUSION : This small study suggests that a once - daily dosing regimen of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice - daily regimen .
Using a single - dose therapy , peak concentration determination is not necessary , only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg / ml .
Effect of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function .
OBJECTIVES : To assess changes induced by <START:Chemical> lithium <END> maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid , parathyroid and ion alterations .
These were evaluated with respect to the duration of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy , age , sex , and family history ( whether or not the patient had a first - degree relative with <START:Disease> thyroid disease <END> ) .
DESIGN : Prospective study .
SETTING : Affective Disorders Clinic at St . Mary ' s Hospital , Montreal .
PATIENTS : One hundred and one patients ( 28 men and 73 women ) with <START:Disease> bipolar disorder <END> receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year ' s to 32 years ' duration .
The control group consisted of 82 patients with no <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital ' s out - patient clinics .
OUTCOME MEASURES : Laboratory analyses of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> , <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> and thyroid - stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy and at biannual follow - up .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Hypothyroidism <END> developed in 40 patients , excluding 8 patients who were <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> at baseline .
All patients having first - degree relatives affected by <START:Disease> thyroid illness <END> had accelerated onset of <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> ( 3 . 7 years after onset of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy ) compared with patients without a family history ( 8 . 6 years after onset of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy ) .
Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> than women under 60 years of age ( 34 . 6 % versus 31 . 9 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Magnesium <END> levels in patients on <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment were unchanged from baseline levels .
After <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment , <START:Chemical> calcium <END> levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels .
Thus , <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma <START:Chemical> calcium <END> levels associated with aging .
CONCLUSIONS : Familial <START:Disease> thyroid illness <END> is a risk factor for <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> and <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
When drugs disappear from the patient : elimination of intravenous medication by hemodiafiltration .
Twenty - three hours after heart transplantation , life - threatening acute <START:Disease> right heart failure <END> was diagnosed in a patient requiring continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) .
Increasing doses of <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> , sedatives , and muscle relaxants administered through a central venous catheter were ineffective .
However , a bolus of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> injected through an alternative catheter provoked a <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> crisis .
Thus , interference with the central venous infusion by the dialysis catheter was suspected .
The catheters were changed , and hemodynamics stabilized at lower <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> doses .
When the effects of IV drugs are inadequate in patients receiving CVVHDF , interference with adjacent catheters resulting in elimination of the drug by CVVHDF should be suspected .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> - induced <START:Disease> inflammation <END> and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B 1 receptor .
Clinical use of the <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ) is limited by its <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> effects , which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis .
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B 1 receptor ( B 1 R ) during the development of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , we studied B 1 R knockout mice ( B 1 R ( - / - )) by investigating cardiac <START:Disease> inflammation <END> and apoptosis after induction of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> DOX <END> control mice showed <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> measured by pressure - volume loops in vivo .
This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT , as well as an increased bax / bcl 2 ratio in Western blots , indicating <START:Disease> cardiac apoptosis <END> .
Furthermore , mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue .
In <START:Chemical> DOX <END> B 1 R ( - / - ) mice , <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> was improved compared to <START:Chemical> DOX <END> control mice , which was associated with normalization of the bax / bcl - 2 ratio and interleukin 6 , as well as AKT activation state .
These findings suggest that B 1 R is detrimental in <START:Chemical> DOX <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis .
These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B 1 R antagonists for treatment of human <START:Chemical> DOX <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of <START:Disease> cognitive dysfunctions <END> .
The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions , total serum <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice .
The ethanolic <START:Chemical> extract of Daucus carota seeds <END> ( <START:Chemical> DCE <END> ) was administered orally in three doses ( 100 , 200 , 400 mg / kg ) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice .
Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory .
<START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> - , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - and ageing - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> served as the interoceptive behavioral models .
<START:Chemical> DCE <END> ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p . o . ) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice .
The extent of memory improvement evoked by <START:Chemical> DCE <END> was 23 % at the dose of 200 mg / kg and 35 % at the dose of 400 mg / kg in young mice using elevated plus maze .
Similarly , significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> DCE <END> reversed the <START:Disease> amnesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 0 . 4 mg / kg , i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 1 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
<START:Chemical> Daucus carota extract <END> ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p . o . ) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> levels in young and aged mice .
The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by <START:Chemical> DCE <END> at the dose of 400 mg / kg was 22 % in young and 19 % in aged mice .
There was a remarkable reduction in total <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> level as well , to the extent of 23 % in young and 21 % in aged animals with this dose of <START:Chemical> DCE <END> .
Therefore , <START:Chemical> DCE <END> may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of <START:Disease> cognitive dysfunctions <END> on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as , memory improving property , <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> lowering property and anticholinesterase activity .
<START:Chemical> Indomethacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> : recurrence on rechallenge .
We have reported a case of acute oliguric <START:Disease> renal failure <END> with <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> , <START:Disease> ascites <END> , and <START:Disease> cor pulmonale <END> after <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> therapy .
Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal , while re - exposure to a single dose of <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> caused recurrence of acute reversible <START:Disease> oliguria <END> .
Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished .
Since nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> , they should be used with caution in such patients .
Recurrent excitation in the dentate gyrus of a murine model of <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> .
Similar to rats , systemic <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> injection causes <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( <START:Disease> SE <END> ) and the eventual development of spontaneous <START:Disease> seizures <END> and mossy fiber sprouting in C 57 BL / 6 and CD 1 mice , but the physiological correlates of these events have not been identified in mice .
Population responses in granule cells of the dentate gyrus were examined in transverse slices of the ventral hippocampus from <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - treated and untreated mice .
In <START:Chemical> Mg <END> ( 2 + ) - free bathing medium containing <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> , conditions designed to increase excitability in the slices , electrical stimulation of the hilus resulted in a single population spike in granule cells from control mice and <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - treated mice that did not experience <START:Disease> SE <END> .
In <START:Disease> SE <END> survivors , similar stimulation resulted in a population spike followed , at a variable latency , by negative DC shifts and repetitive afterdischarges of 3 - 60 s duration , which were blocked by ionotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptor antagonists .
Focal <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> photostimulation of the granule cell layer at sites distant from the recording pipette resulted in population responses of 1 - 30 s duration in slices from <START:Disease> SE <END> survivors but not other groups .
These data support the hypothesis that <START:Disease> SE <END> - induced mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization are relevant characteristics of <START:Disease> seizure <END> development in these murine strains , resembling rat models of human <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> .
Optimization of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy .
While there is no single correct starting dose for <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy , many individuals can be started on either the 25 / 100 or controlled - release formula , following the general rule not to attempt to titrate <START:Chemical> carbidopa <END> - <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> to the point of " normality , " which can lead to <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications ; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment .
Following the initial period of therapy , emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches , such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> agonist .
Other possible adverse effects -- such as <START:Disease> gastrointestinal disorders <END> , <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> , <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> , <START:Disease> sleep disturbances <END> or <START:Disease> parasomnias <END> , or drug interactions -- also require carefully monitored individual treatment .
Nonpharmacologic concerns can help the <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> patient achieve and maintain optimal functioning , including daily exercise , physical therapy , and involvement with support groups .
<START:Chemical> Pilocarpine <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> cause age - dependent <START:Disease> impairment in auditory location discrimination <END> .
Children who have <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> have continuous or rapidly repeating <START:Disease> seizures <END> that may be life - threatening and may cause life - long changes in brain and behavior .
The extent to which <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> causes <START:Disease> deficits in auditory discrimination <END> is unknown .
A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> .
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day ( P ) 20 , or a convulsant dose of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> on P 20 or P 45 .
<START:Chemical> Pilocarpine <END> on either day induced <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ; <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> at P 45 resulted in CA 3 cell loss and spontaneous <START:Disease> seizures <END> , whereas P 20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Mature rats were trained with sound - source location and sound - silence discriminations .
Control ( saline P 20 ) rats acquired both discriminations immediately .
In <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( P 20 ) rats , acquisition of the sound - source location discrimination was moderately impaired .
<START:Disease> Status epilepticus <END> ( P 45 ) rats failed to acquire either sound - source location or sound - silence discriminations .
<START:Disease> Status epilepticus <END> in rat causes an age - dependent , long - term <START:Disease> impairment in auditory discrimination <END> .
This impairment may explain one cause of <START:Disease> impaired auditory location discrimination <END> in humans .
Serotonergic drugs , <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> and <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> block <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> in a strain of mice .
In male Swiss mice , <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> produced <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> .
A 3 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min . Increasing the brain <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> levels by the administration of <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptophan <END> ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> effect .
However , in a similar experiment <START:Chemical> l - dopa <END> ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) was without effect .
In doses of 3 - 10 mg / kg , the <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> receptor agonist <START:Chemical> MK - 212 <END> caused a dose - dependent blockade of the response of <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> .
Of the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> , <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 mg / kg ) was found to be several fold more potent than <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 0 . 3 - 3 mg / kg ) in blocking the <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> .
While ( - ) - <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> ( 1 - 3 mg / kg ) proved to be an effective antagonist of <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> , its ( + ) - isomer ( 5 - 20 mg / kg ) lacked this property .
Considering the fact that <START:Chemical> 5 - HTP <END> and the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> , the <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition .
Our present study indicated the possible value of <START:Chemical> MK - 212 <END> and ( - ) - <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> in the management of clinical <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> .
Provocation of postural <START:Disease> hypotension <END> by <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> in <START:Disease> diabetic autonomic neuropathy <END> ?
The effect of <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects , 12 <START:Disease> diabetic <END> subjects without <START:Disease> autonomic neuropathy <END> , and 5 <START:Disease> diabetic <END> subjects with <START:Disease> autonomic neuropathy <END> .
The magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> were similar in the normal and <START:Disease> diabetic <END> subjects without <START:Disease> autonomic neuropathy <END> , whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the <START:Disease> diabetic <END> subjects with <START:Disease> autonomic neuropathy <END> .
It is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in <START:Disease> diabetic <END> patients , particularly those with <START:Disease> autonomic neuropathy <END> .
Is <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> administration safe in a <START:Disease> hypothermic <END> child ?
A male neonate with a <START:Disease> Chiari malformation <END> and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele .
During anaesthesia and surgery , he inadvertently became moderately <START:Disease> hypothermic <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> was administered during the later part of the surgery for <START:Disease> seizure <END> prophylaxis .
Following <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> administration , the patient developed acute severe <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , refractory to <START:Chemical> atropine <END> and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> .
The cardiac depressant actions of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> and <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> can be additive .
Administration of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> in the presence of <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children .
As <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> is a commonly used drug , clinicians need to be aware of this interaction .
Effects of calcitonin on rat extrapyramidal motor system : behavioral and biochemical data .
The effects of i . v . c . injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system , were investigated in male rats .
Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and a partial prevention of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
Moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nigral GAD activity but no change in striatal <START:Chemical> DA <END> and <START:Chemical> DOPAC <END> concentration or GAD activity .
The results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the striatonigral GABAergic pathway mediating the <START:Chemical> DA <END> - related behavioral messages of striatal origin .
Neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> protect against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - and <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced limbic <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> in mice .
Several structurally related metabolites of <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 20 - ones <END> ) and <START:Chemical> deoxycorticosterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 21 - diol - 20 - ones <END> ) and their 3 beta - epimers were evaluated for protective activity against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - , <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - and <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice .
<START:Chemical> Steroids <END> with the 3 - hydroxy group in the alpha - position and 5 - H in the alpha - or beta - configurations were highly effective in protecting against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ( 416 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced limbic motor <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( ED 50 values , 7 . 0 - 18 . 7 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
The corresponding epimers with the 3 - hydroxy group in the beta - position were also effective but less potent ( ED 50 values , 33 . 8 - 63 . 5 , i . p . ) .
Although the neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> were considerably less potent than the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> in protecting against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> , <START:Chemical> steroids <END> with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - configuration had comparable or higher protective index values ( TD 50 for motor impairment divided by ED 50 for <START:Disease> seizure <END> protection ) than <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> , indicating that some neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> may have lower relative <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Steroids <END> with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - or 5 beta , 3 alpha - configurations also produced a dose - dependent delay in the onset of limbic <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> ( 32 mg / kg , s . c . ) , but did not completely protect against the <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
However , when a second dose of the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> was administered 1 hr after the first dose , complete protection from the <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced limbic <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> was obtained .
The <START:Chemical> steroids <END> also caused a dose - dependent delay in <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ( 257 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced lethality , but did not completely protect against <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> or lethality .
We conclude that neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> are highly effective in protecting against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - and <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> in mice , and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> in humans .
<START:Chemical> Naloxazone <END> pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory , temperature , and behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or <START:Chemical> naloxazone <END> , an antagonist of high - affinity mu 1 opioid receptors .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> naloxazone <END> significantly blocked <START:Chemical> morphine <END> <START:Disease> analgesia <END> , <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> at a dose which completely eliminated high - affinity binding in brain membranes .
Moreover , <START:Chemical> naloxazone <END> significantly attenuated the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> respiratory depression <END> , whereas <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was less affected .
Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , and <START:Disease> asystole <END> after high - dose intravenous <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> in a monitored patient .
We report a case of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , and <START:Disease> asystole <END> after intravenous administration of high - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> in a 73 - year - old patient who underwent electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring throughout the episode .
There was a history of <START:Disease> ischemic <END> <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> 9 years earlier .
The patient was admitted with a <START:Disease> pulmonary - renal syndrome <END> with <START:Disease> hemoptysis <END> , rapidly progressive <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , and <START:Disease> hypoxemia <END> that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit .
After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the patient recovered cardiac rhythm .
The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> .
This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of <START:Disease> sudden death <END> after a high dose of intravenous <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> IVMP <END> ) .
These mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event .
Rapid infusion and underlying <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> were important risk factors in the case reported here , and the authors discount <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> as the main mechanism .
The correlation between <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> esterase inhibition and <START:Chemical> mipafox <END> - induced <START:Disease> neuropathic damage <END> in rats .
The correlation between <START:Disease> neuropathic damage <END> and inhibition of <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> esterase or <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> target enzyme ( NTE ) was examined in rats acutely exposed to <START:Chemical> Mipafox <END> ( <START:Chemical> N , N ' - diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate <END> ) , a <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> <START:Chemical> organophosphate <END> .
Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long - Evans male rats 1 hr post - exposure to various dosages of <START:Chemical> Mipafox <END> ( ip , 1 - 15 mg / kg ) .
These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical <START:Disease> cord damage <END> in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14 - 21 days post - exposure .
Those dosages ( greater than or equal to 10 mg / kg ) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73 % and brain greater than or equal to 67 % of control values produced severe ( greater than or equal to 3 ) cervical cord pathology in 85 % of the rats .
In contrast , dosages of <START:Chemical> Mipafox <END> ( less than or equal to 5 mg / kg ) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61 % and brain less than or equal to 60 % produced this degree of <START:Disease> cord damage <END> in only 9 % of the animals .
These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after <START:Chemical> Mipafox <END> exposure can predict <START:Disease> neuropathic damage <END> in rats several weeks later .
<START:Disease> Hepatotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac <START:Disease> tachyarrhythmias <END> .
The use of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> has , however , been limited due to its serious side - effects .
A patient with <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> treatment is presented below and a review of the <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> is given .
It is concluded that solid evidence exists of <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> due to <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> treatment , including <START:Disease> steatosis <END> , alterations resembling <START:Disease> alcoholic hepatitis <END> , <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> and micronodular <START:Disease> cirrhosis of the liver <END> .
Patients receiving <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels .
Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of <START:Disease> cholestatic injury <END> or <START:Disease> hepatomegaly <END> .
Cerebral blood flow and metabolism during <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in patients subjected to surgery for <START:Disease> cerebral aneurysms <END> .
Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> were measured during <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a <START:Disease> cerebral aneurysm <END> .
Flow and metabolism were measured 5 - 13 days after the <START:Disease> subarachnoid haemorrhage <END> by a modification of the classical Kety - Schmidt technique using <START:Chemical> xenon <END> - 133 i . v .
Anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> concentration of 0 . 75 % ( plus 67 % <START:Chemical> nitrous oxide <END> in <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> ) , during which CBF and CMRO 2 were 34 . 3 + / - 2 . 1 ml / 100 g min - 1 and 2 . 32 + / - 0 . 16 ml / 100 g min - 1 at PaCO 2 4 . 1 + / - 0 . 1 kPa ( mean + / - SEM ) .
Controlled <START:Disease> hypotension <END> to an average MAP of 50 - 55 mm <START:Chemical> Hg <END> was induced by increasing the dose of <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> , and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2 . 2 + / - 0 . 2 % .
This resulted in a significant decrease in CMRO 2 ( to 1 . 73 + / - 0 . 16 ml / 100 g min - 1 ) , while CBF was unchanged .
After the clipping of the <START:Disease> aneurysm <END> the <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> concentration was reduced to 0 . 75 % .
There was a significant increase in CBF , although CMRO 2 was unchanged , compared with pre - <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> values .
These changes might offer protection to brain tissue during periods of induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
<START:Chemical> Spironolactone <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> and <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> in patients with <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> in <START:Disease> heart failure <END> patients reported a low risk of <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> ( 2 % ) and <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> ( 0 % ) .
Because treatments for <START:Disease> heart failure <END> have changed since the benefits of <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice .
We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> and <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> in <START:Disease> heart failure <END> patients treated with <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> .
METHODS : We performed a case control study of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> patients treated with <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> in our clinical practice .
Cases were patients who developed <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> ( <START:Chemical> K <END> ( + ) > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) or <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> ( <START:Chemical> Cr <END> > or = 2 . 5 mg / dL ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case .
Clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared .
RESULTS : Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> due to <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> ( n = 33 ) or <START:Disease> renal failure <END> ( n = 34 ) .
Patients who developed <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> were older and more likely to have <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , had higher baseline serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels and lower baseline <START:Chemical> potassium <END> supplement doses , and were more likely to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) .
Patients who developed <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated with <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> diuretics than controls .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Spironolactone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> and <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously .
This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta - blockers .
<START:Chemical> MDMA <END> polydrug users show process - specific central executive impairments coupled with <START:Disease> impaired social and emotional judgement processes <END> .
In recent years working <START:Disease> memory deficits <END> have been reported in users of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine <END> , <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> ) .
The current study aimed to assess the impact of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use on three separate central executive processes ( set shifting , inhibition and memory updating ) and also on " prefrontal " mediated social and emotional judgement processes .
Fifteen polydrug <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> users and 15 polydrug non - <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> user controls completed a general drug use questionnaire , the Brixton Spatial Anticipation task ( set shifting ) , Backward Digit Span procedure ( memory updating ) , Inhibition of Return ( inhibition ) , an emotional intelligence scale , the Tromso Social Intelligence Scale and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire ( DEX ) .
Compared with <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> - free polydrug controls , <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> polydrug users showed impairments in set shifting and memory updating , and also in social and emotional judgement processes .
The latter two deficits remained significant after controlling for other drug use .
These data lend further support to the proposal that cognitive processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex may be impaired by recreational <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> use .
Dual effects of <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> on <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> - induced <START:Disease> narcosis <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Melatonin <END> affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced <START:Disease> narcosis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sodium thiopenthal <END> was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 and 50 mg / kg ) .
<START:Chemical> Melatonin <END> pre - treatment affected in a dual manner <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> <START:Disease> narcosis <END> , however , no dose - effect correlation was found .
In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> <START:Disease> narcosis <END> .
In contrast , the highest dose of <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of <START:Disease> narcosis <END> , and a reduction in mortality rate .
<START:Chemical> Melatonin <END> 0 . 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - or <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced <START:Disease> narcosis <END> .
Thus , the dual action of <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> on pharmacological <START:Disease> narcosis <END> seems to be specific for the <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> mechanism of action .
<START:Disease> Chronic active hepatitis <END> associated with <START:Chemical> diclofenac sodium <END> therapy .
<START:Chemical> Diclofenac sodium <END> ( <START:Chemical> Voltarol <END> , Geigy Pharmaceuticals ) is a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory derivative of <START:Chemical> phenylacetic acid <END> .
Although generally well - tolerated , asymptomatic <START:Disease> abnormalities of liver function <END> have been recorded and , less commonly , severe <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> .
The patient described developed <START:Disease> chronic active hepatitis <END> after six months therapy with <START:Chemical> diclofenac sodium <END> which progressed despite the withdrawal of the drug , a finding not previously reported .
Memory function and <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> transporter promoter gene polymorphism in <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> ( <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> ) users .
Although <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> or <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> ) has been shown to damage brain <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ) neurons in animals and possibly humans , little is known about the long - term consequences of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> - induced <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxic lesions <END> on functions in which <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> is involved , such as cognitive function .
Because <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> transporter promoter gene region ( 5 - HTTLPR ) when studying the effects of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> as well as cognitive functioning .
The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use on cognitive function , as well as the effects of long - term abstention from <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> , in subjects genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR .
A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males .
Fifteen moderate <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> users ( < 55 lifetime tablets ) , 22 heavy <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> + users ( > 55 lifetime tablets ) , 16 ex - <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> + users ( last tablet > 1 year ago ) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests .
DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods . A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks ( p = 0 . 04 ) but not on reaction times ( p = 0 . 61 ) or attention / executive functioning ( p = 0 . 59 ) .
Heavy and ex - <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> + users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls .
In contrast , no evidence of <START:Disease> memory impairment <END> was observed in moderate <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> users .
No significant effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender was observed .
While the use of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> in quantities that may be considered " moderate " is not associated with <START:Disease> impaired memory functioning <END> , heavy use of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use may lead to long lasting <START:Disease> memory impairments <END> .
No effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender on memory function or <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use was observed .
Effects of pallidal <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> on <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian catalepsy <END> : behavioral and electrophysiological studies .
OBJECTIVE : The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation .
Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum , and systemic administration of a <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects .
The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> on <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian symptoms <END> .
METHODS : Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study .
RESULTS : Bilateral infusions of <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> into the globus pallidus reversed <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian catalepsy <END> in rats .
Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> administration .
The <START:Chemical> neurotensin type - 1 receptor antagonist <END> <START:Chemical> SR 48692 <END> blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> .
CONCLUSION : Activation of pallidal <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> receptors may be involved in <START:Chemical> neurotensin <END> - induced antiparkinsonian effects .
Promotional effects of <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and dietary fat on prostate <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> in genetically susceptible rats .
Germfree ( GF ) Lobund strain Wistar ( LW ) rats , fed vegetable diet L - 485 , have developed <START:Disease> prostate adenocarcinomas <END> spontaneously ( 10 % incidence ) at average age 34 months .
Conventional LW rats , implanted with <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> at age 4 months , developed a higher incidence of <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> after an average interval of 14 months : 24 % had developed gross <START:Disease> tumors <END> , and 40 % when it included microscopic <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
Preliminary results indicate that <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> - treated LW rats that were fed the same diet , which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20 % fat , developed <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> after intervals of 6 - 12 months .
Aged GF Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats have not developed <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> spontaneously .
Conventional SD rats fed diet L - 485 and treated with <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> developed only <START:Disease> prostatitis <END> .
Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> .
<START:Disease> Palpebral twitching <END> in a <START:Disease> depressed <END> adolescent on <START:Chemical> citalopram <END> .
Current estimates suggest that between 0 . 4 % and 8 . 3 % of children and adolescents are affected by <START:Disease> major depression <END> .
We report a favorable response to treatment with <START:Chemical> citalopram <END> by a 15 - year - old boy with <START:Disease> major depression <END> who exhibited <START:Disease> palpebral twitching <END> during his first 2 weeks of treatment .
This may have been a side effect of <START:Chemical> citalopram <END> as it remitted with redistribution of doses .
<START:Chemical> Quinidine <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Long - term administration of <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT , <START:Chemical> lactic acid <END> dehydrogenase , and alkaline phosphatase .
Liver biopsy showed active <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Discontinuance of <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> therapy led to normalization of liver function tests .
A challenge dose of <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT , alkaline phosphatase , and <START:Chemical> lactic acid <END> dehydrogenase values .
We concluded that this patient had <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation .
This report also suggests that , even after long - term administration , the <START:Disease> hepatic toxicity <END> is reversible .
Facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test <START:Chemical> morphine <END> and its state dependency in the step - through type passive avoidance learning test in mice .
<START:Disease> Amnesia <END> produced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> and <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> were reversed by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> given 30 min before the test trial ( pre - test ) , and pre - test <START:Chemical> morphine <END> also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> during the training trial .
Similarly , pre - test <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> partially reversed the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , but not significantly ; and pre - test <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> failed to reverse the <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
These results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre - test <START:Chemical> morphine <END> might be the direct action of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> rather than a state dependent effect .
Multiple side effects of <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> therapy in one patient with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
<START:Disease> Skin rashes <END> , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> and <START:Disease> myasthenia gravis <END> have all been recorded as complications of <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> therapy in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
A patient who had developed all 5 is now described .
The <START:Disease> skin lesion <END> resembled <START:Disease> elastosis perforans serpiginosa <END> , which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with <START:Disease> Wilson ' s disease <END> but not in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> .
Comparison of the respiratory effects of i . v . infusions of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> and regional analgesia by extradural block .
The incidence of postoperative respiratory <START:Disease> apnoea <END> was compared between five patients receiving a continuous i . v . infusion of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( mean 73 . 6 mg ) and five patients receiving a continuous extradural infusion of 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( mean 192 mg ) in the 24 - h period following upper abdominal surgery .
Monitoring consisted of airflow detection by a <START:Chemical> carbon dioxide <END> analyser , chest wall movement detected by pneumatic capsules , and continuous electrocardiograph recorded with a Holter ambulatory monitor .
Both <START:Disease> obstructive ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and central apnoea <END> ( P less than 0 . 05 ) occurred more frequently in patients who had a <START:Chemical> morphine <END> infusion .
There was also a higher incidence of <START:Disease> tachyarrhythmias <END> ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and <START:Disease> ventricular ectopic beats <END> ( P less than 0 . 05 ) in the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> infusion group .
Prophylactic use of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> with chronic immunosuppressive therapy for <START:Disease> rheumatologic disorders <END> .
The objective of this study was to report our experience concerning the effectiveness of the prophylactic administration of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> in <START:Chemical> hepatitis B virus surface antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBs Ag <END> ) positive patients with <START:Disease> rheumatologic disease <END> .
From June 2004 to October 2006 , 11 <START:Chemical> HBs Ag <END> positive patients with <START:Disease> rheumatologic diseases <END> , who were on both immunosuppressive and prophylactic <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> therapies , were retrospectively assessed .
Liver function tests , <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> virus ( HBV ) serologic markers , and HBV DNA levels of the patients during follow - up were obtained from hospital file records .
Eleven patients ( six male ) with median age 47 years ( range 27 - 73 ) , median disease duration 50 months ( range 9 - 178 ) and median follow - up period of patients 13 . 8 months ( range 5 - 27 ) were enrolled in this study .
<START:Chemical> Lamivudine <END> therapy was started 3 - 7 days prior to immunosuppressive therapy in all patients .
Baseline , liver function tests were elevated in two patients ( fourth patient : ALT : 122 IU / l , AST : 111 IU / l , tenth patient : ALT : 294 IU / l , AST : 274 IU / l , with minimal changes in the liver biopsy in both ) .
Shortly after treatment their tests normalized and during follow - up period none of the patients had <START:Disease> abnormal liver function <END> tests .
In four patients HBV DNA levels were higher than normal at baseline .
Two of these normalized and the others increased later .
In three additional patients , HBV DNA levels were increased during follow - up .
None of the patients had significant clinical sings of HBV activation .
<START:Chemical> Lamivudine <END> was well tolerated and was continued in all patients .
Prophylactic administration of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> in patients who required immunosuppressive therapy seems to be safe , well tolerated and effective in preventing HBV reactivation .
<START:Chemical> CCNU <END> ( <START:Chemical> lomustine <END> ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in dogs : a retrospective study ( 2002 - 07 ) .
OBJECTIVE : To describe the incidence of <START:Disease> haematological , renal , hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities <END> in tumour - bearing dogs receiving <START:Chemical> 1 - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 3 - cyclohexyl - 1 - nitrosourea <END> ( <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> ) .
DESIGN : The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated .
RESULTS : Of the 206 dogs treated with <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> , 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> CCNU <END> was used most commonly in the treatment of <START:Disease> lymphoma <END> , <START:Disease> mast cell tumour <END> , <START:Disease> brain tumour <END> , <START:Disease> histiocytic tumours <END> and <START:Disease> epitheliotropic lymphoma <END> .
Throughout treatment , 56 . 9 % of dogs experienced <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> , 34 . 2 % experienced <START:Disease> anaemia <END> and 14 . 2 % experienced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
<START:Disease> Gastrointestinal toxicosis <END> was detected in 37 . 8 % of dogs , the most common sign of which was <START:Disease> vomiting <END> ( 24 . 3 % ) .
Potential renal <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and elevated <START:Chemical> alanine <END> transaminase ( ALT ) concentration were reported in 12 . 2 % and 48 . 8 % of dogs , respectively .
The incidence of <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> was 1 . 2 % .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> - associated <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in dogs is common , but is usually not life threatening .
No enhancement by <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> of the hepatocarcinogenicity of a <START:Chemical> choline <END> - devoid diet in the rat .
An experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> in a <START:Chemical> choline <END> - devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcinogenicity of the diet .
Groups of 5 - week old male Fischer - 344 rats were fed for 7 - 25 months semipurified <START:Chemical> choline <END> - devoid or <START:Chemical> choline <END> - supplemented diets , containing or not 0 . 06 % <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> .
No hepatic preneoplastic nodules or <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinomas <END> developed in rats fed the plain <START:Chemical> choline <END> - supplemented diet , while one preneoplastic nodule and one <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> developed in two rats fed the same diet containing <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> .
The incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinomas <END> was 10 % and 37 % , respectively , in rats fed the plain <START:Chemical> choline <END> - devoid diet , and 17 % and 30 % , in rats fed the <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> - containing <START:Chemical> choline <END> - devoid diet .
The results evinced no enhancement of the hepatocarcinogenicity of the <START:Chemical> choline <END> - devoid diet by <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> .
Sporadic neoplastic lesions were observed in organs other than the liver of some of the animals , irrespective of the diet fed .
Effects of <START:Chemical> amine <END> pretreatment on <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> <START:Disease> catatonia <END> in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals .
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> and pineal idolamines on <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> catatonia <END> in the intact , pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat .
In the pinealectomized chick , pretreatment with <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> increased the duration of <START:Disease> catatonia <END> ( DOC ) after <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> , but pretreatment with <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> did not .
The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions .
<START:Chemical> Serotonin <END> and <START:Chemical> N - acetyl serotonin <END> which augmented <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> potentiated the <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> did not augment the <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC whereas <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> continued to do so .
This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the <START:Chemical> amines <END> on the pineal in spite of the immature blood - brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat .
In addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC induced by <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> <START:Disease> catatonia <END> rather than directly on the pituitary .
Anti - <START:Disease> epileptic <END> drugs - induced de novo <START:Disease> absence seizures <END> .
The authors present three patients with de novo <START:Disease> absence epilepsy <END> after administration of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> and <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> .
Despite the underlying diseases , the prognosis for drug - induced de novo <START:Disease> absence seizure <END> is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs .
The <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acid <END> - transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the <START:Disease> absence epilepsy <END> .
Because drug - induced de novo <START:Disease> absence seizure <END> is rare , pro - absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor .
The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo <START:Disease> absence seizure <END> .
The possibility of drug - induced aggravation should be considered whenever an unexpected increase in <START:Disease> seizure <END> frequency and / or new <START:Disease> seizure <END> types appear following a change in drug treatment .
By understanding the underlying mechanism of <START:Disease> absence epilepsy <END> , we can avoid the inappropriate use of anticonvulsants in children with <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> and prevent drug - induced <START:Disease> absence seizures <END> .
Rebound <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> after <START:Chemical> sodium nitroprusside <END> prevented by <START:Chemical> saralasin <END> in rats .
The role of the renin -- <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system in the maintenance of blood pressure during <START:Chemical> halothane <END> anesthesia and <START:Chemical> sodium nitroprusside <END> ( <START:Chemical> SNP <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> was evaluated .
Control rats received <START:Chemical> halothane <END> anesthesia ( 1 MAC ) for one hour , followed by <START:Chemical> SNP <END> infusion , 40 microgram / kg / min , for 30 min , followed by a 30 - min recovery period .
A second group of rats was treated identically and , in addition , received an infusion of <START:Chemical> saralasin <END> ( a competitive inhibitor of <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> ) throughout the experimental period .
In each group , <START:Chemical> SNP <END> infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr , respectively , to 48 torr .
During the <START:Chemical> SNP <END> infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive <START:Disease> increase in blood pressure <END> to 61 torr , whereas the <START:Chemical> saralasin <END> - treated animals showed no change .
Following discontinuation of <START:Chemical> SNP <END> , blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr , as compared with 78 torr in the <START:Chemical> saralasin <END> - treated rats .
This study indicates that with stable <START:Chemical> halothane <END> anesthesia , the partial recovery of blood pressure during <START:Chemical> SNP <END> infusion and the post - <START:Chemical> SNP <END> rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by <START:Chemical> saralasin <END> .
This demonstrates the participation of the renin -- <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system in antagonizing the combined <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> effects of <START:Chemical> halothane <END> and <START:Chemical> SNP <END> .
Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment in rats .
The development of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events , in combination leading to overt disease .
We investigated the effect of an early stress , in the form of maternal deprivation , combined with a later stress , simulated by chronic periadolescent <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment , on behaviour in rats .
Acute treatment with <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> caused disruption of prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment , but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress .
<START:Chemical> Amphetamine <END> treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non - deprived groups , but was absent in both maternally deprived groups .
The <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> - 1 A receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> 8 - OH - DPAT <END> , induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups .
<START:Chemical> Amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> was similar in all groups .
These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress , caused by maternal deprivation , combined with ' adolescent ' stress , simulated by <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment , on dopaminergic regulation of PPI .
The altered effects of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> and <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> could indicate differential changes in <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation , or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus .
A study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous <START:Chemical> heparin <END> injection on <START:Disease> bruising <END> and <START:Disease> pain <END> .
AIM : This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on <START:Disease> bruising <END> and <START:Disease> pain <END> following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> .
BACKGROUND : Although different methods to prevent <START:Disease> bruising <END> and <START:Disease> pain <END> following the subcutaneous injection of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of <START:Disease> bruising <END> and <START:Disease> pain <END> is little documented .
DESIGN : This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research .
METHOD : The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous <START:Chemical> heparin <END> was administered .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .
Injections areas were assessed for the presence of <START:Disease> bruising <END> at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .
Dimensions of the <START:Disease> bruising <END> on the <START:Chemical> heparin <END> applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .
The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure <START:Disease> pain <END> intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the <START:Disease> pain <END> period .
Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation .
RESULTS : The percentage of <START:Disease> bruising <END> occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection .
It was determined that the size of the <START:Disease> bruising <END> was smaller in the 30 - second injection .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> intensity and <START:Disease> pain <END> period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .
CONCLUSIONS : It was determined that injection duration had an effect on <START:Disease> bruising <END> and <START:Disease> pain <END> following the subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> .
This study should be repeated on a larger sample .
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE : When administering subcutaneous <START:Chemical> heparin <END> injections , it is important to extend the duration of the injection .
Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients ( CARE ) study : a randomized double - blind trial of contrast - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> in patients with <START:Disease> chronic kidney disease <END> .
BACKGROUND : No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low - osmolality <START:Chemical> contrast medium <END> <START:Chemical> iopamidol <END> with that of the iso - osmolality <START:Chemical> contrast medium <END> <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> in high - risk patients .
METHODS AND RESULTS : The present study is a multicenter , randomized , double - blind comparison of <START:Chemical> iopamidol <END> and <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> in patients with <START:Disease> chronic kidney disease <END> ( estimated glomerular filtration rate , 20 to 59 mL / min ) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions .
Serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> ( SCr ) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications .
The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 . 2 micromol / L ) over baseline .
Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25 % , a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25 % , and the mean peak change in SCr .
In 414 patients , contrast volume , presence of <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> , use of <START:Chemical> N - acetylcysteine <END> , mean baseline SCr , and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups .
SCr increases > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL occurred in 4 . 4 % ( 9 of 204 patients ) after <START:Chemical> iopamidol <END> and 6 . 7 % ( 14 of 210 patients ) after <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> ( P = 0 . 39 ) , whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25 % were 9 . 8 % and 12 . 4 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 44 ) .
In patients with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , SCr increases > or = 0 . 5 mg / dL were 5 . 1 % ( 4 of 78 patients ) with <START:Chemical> iopamidol <END> and 13 . 0 % ( 12 of 92 patients ) with <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> ( P = 0 . 11 ) , whereas SCr increases > or = 25 % were 10 . 3 % and 15 . 2 % , respectively ( P = 0 . 37 ) .
Mean post - SCr increases were significantly less with <START:Chemical> iopamidol <END> ( all patients : 0 . 07 versus 0 . 12 mg / dL , 6 . 2 versus 10 . 6 micromol / L , P = 0 . 03 ; patients with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> : 0 . 07 versus 0 . 16 mg / dL , 6 . 2 versus 14 . 1 micromol / L , P = 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The rate of contrast - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> , defined by multiple end points , is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of <START:Chemical> iopamidol <END> or <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> to high - risk patients , with or without <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> .
Any true difference between the agents is small and not likely to be clinically significant .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> -- a highly aggressive disease : analysis of 12 cases .
PURPOSE : We gained knowledge of the etiology , treatment and prevention of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> urothelial cancer <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The medical records of 6 men and 6 women ( mean age 55 years ) with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> were reviewed .
RESULTS : All <START:Disease> tumors <END> were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> .
Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease .
Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months .
The remaining patient with extensive <START:Disease> cancer <END> underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> bladder tumor <END> is an aggressive disease .
However , long - term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for <START:Disease> bladder tumors <END> with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease , even when noninvasive .
<START:Chemical> Amisulpride <END> related <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> in an adolescent <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> .
<START:Disease> Tic disorders <END> can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> , <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> and <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> .
However , there are two case reports that show <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> , including motor and phonic variants , occurring during treatment with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> or <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
We present a 15 - year - old girl <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> who developed frequent <START:Disease> involuntary eye - blinking movements <END> after 5 months of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> treatment ( 1000 mg per day ) .
The <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> resolved completely after we reduced the dose of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> down to 800 mg per day .
However , her <START:Disease> psychosis <END> recurred after the dose reduction .
We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> .
She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function .
No more <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> or other side effects have been reported .
Together with previously reported cases , our patient suggests that <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> , <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> , or <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> .
<START:Disease> Allergic reaction <END> to <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> infusion .
An <START:Disease> allergic reaction <END> consisting of <START:Disease> angioneurotic edema <END> secondary to continuous infusion <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> occurred in a patient with recurrent <START:Disease> carcinoma of the oral cavity <END> , <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> , and <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> - induced <START:Disease> impaired renal function <END> .
This reaction occurred during the sixth and seventh courses of infusional chemotherapy .
Oral <START:Chemical> diphenhydramine <END> and <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> were ineffective in preventing the recurrence of the <START:Disease> allergic reaction <END> .
Discontinuance of effective chemotherapy in this patient during partial remission resulted in fatal disease progression .
Effects of <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> on symptoms and postcibal small - bowel motor function in patients with <START:Disease> irritable bowel syndrome <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Irritable bowel syndrome <END> is a common cause of <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> and discomfort and may be related to <START:Disease> disordered gastrointestinal motility <END> .
Our aim was to assess the effects of long - term treatment with a prokinetic agent , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the <START:Disease> irritable bowel syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> IBS <END> ) .
METHODS : Thirty - eight patients with <START:Disease> IBS <END> ( <START:Disease> constipation <END> - predominant , n = 17 ; <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> - predominant , n = 21 ) underwent 24 - h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week ' s treatment [ <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , 5 mg three times daily ( n = 19 ) or placebo ( n = 19 ) ] .
RESULTS : In <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> - predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> and placebo groups .
In <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> - treated <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> - predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher ( 29 . 3 + / - 3 . 2 versus 24 . 9 + / - 2 . 6 mm Hg , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 25 . 7 + / - 6 . 0 mm Hg ) , the mean contraction duration longer ( 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 versus 3 . 0 + / - 0 . 2 sec , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 3 . 1 + / - 0 . 5 sec ) , and the mean contraction frequency lower ( 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 2 versus 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 4 cont . / min , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 2 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 cont . / min ] than patients treated with placebo .
No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the <START:Disease> constipation <END> - predominant <START:Disease> IBS <END> group .
Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment .
Symptom scores relating to the severity of <START:Disease> constipation <END> were lower in <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> - treated <START:Disease> constipation <END> - predominant <START:Disease> IBS <END> patients [ score , 54 + / - 5 versus 67 + / - 14 mm , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; pretreatment , 62 + / - 19 mm ] .
<START:Disease> Diarrhoea <END> - predominant <START:Disease> IBS <END> patients had a higher <START:Disease> pain <END> score after <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> therapy [ score , 55 + / - 15 versus 34 + / - 12 mm , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; pretreatment , 67 + / - 19 mm ] .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Cisapride <END> affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in <START:Disease> IBS <END> .
The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> on animal models .
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> and explore the underlying ionic mechanism , using both <START:Chemical> aconitine <END> - induced rat and <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> - induced guinea pig <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> models .
Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free - <START:Chemical> calcium <END> concentrations ( [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) ] ( i )) in isolated myocytes .
The current data showed that <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> significantly delayed onset of <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> , decreased the time course of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation <END> , reduced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> score , and increased the survival time of <START:Disease> arrhythmic <END> rats and guinea pigs .
[ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) overload induced by <START:Chemical> aconitine <END> or <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
Moreover , M ( 3 ) - muscarinic <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor ( mAChR ) antagonist <START:Chemical> 4 - DAMP <END> ( <START:Chemical> 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine - methiodide <END> ) partially abolished the beneficial effects of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> produced antiarrhythmic actions on <START:Disease> arrhythmic <END> rat and guinea pig models induced by <START:Chemical> aconitine <END> or <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> via stimulating the cardiac M ( 3 ) - mAChR .
The mechanism may be related to the improvement of <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) handling .
<START:Chemical> Prazosin <END> - induced <START:Disease> stress incontinence <END> .
A case of genuine <START:Disease> stress incontinence <END> due to <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> , a common antihypertensive drug , is presented .
<START:Chemical> Prazosin <END> exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha - 1 adrenergic receptors .
As an alpha - blocker , it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and urethra .
The patient ' s clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> and subsequent studies while taking <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> .
Her <START:Disease> incontinence <END> resolved with the change of medication .
The restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure , maximum urethral closure pressure , and functional urethral length .
Patients who present with <START:Disease> stress incontinence <END> while taking <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery , because their <START:Disease> incontinence <END> may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy .
Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> volume in a mouse model of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - associated <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - associated <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> ( W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> ) is a severe type of <START:Disease> stroke <END> .
There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> .
Using a mouse model , we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human <START:Chemical> prothrombin complex concentrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PCC <END> ) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume .
Male CD - 1 mice were treated with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> ( 2 mg / kg over 24 h ) , resulting in a mean ( + / - s . d . ) International Normalized Ratio of 3 . 5 + / - 0 . 9 .
First , we showed that an intravenous administration of human <START:Chemical> PCC <END> rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice .
Second , a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> in the right striatum .
Forty - five minutes later , the animals were randomly treated with <START:Chemical> PCC <END> ( 100 U / kg ) or saline i . v . ( n = 12 per group ) .
Twenty - four hours after <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> induction , hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay .
The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in <START:Chemical> PCC <END> - treated animals ( 6 . 5 + / - 3 . 1 microL ) compared with saline controls ( 15 . 3 + / - 11 . 2 microL , P = 0 . 015 ) .
In the saline group , 45 % of the mice developed large <START:Disease> hematomas <END> ( i . e . , > 15 microL ) .
In contrast , such extensive lesions were never found in the <START:Chemical> PCC <END> group .
We provide experimental data suggesting <START:Chemical> PCC <END> to be an effective acute treatment for W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume .
Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> .
<START:Chemical> Desipramine <END> - induced <START:Disease> delirium <END> at " subtherapeutic " concentrations : a case report .
An elderly patient treated with low dose <START:Chemical> Desipramine <END> developed a <START:Disease> delirium <END> while her plasma level was in the " subtherapeutic " range .
<START:Disease> Delirium <END> , which may be induced by tricyclic drug therapy in the elderly , can be caused by tricyclics with low anticholinergic potency .
Therapeutic ranges for <START:Chemical> antidepressants <END> that have been derived from general adult population studies may not be appropriate for the elderly .
Further studies of specifically elderly patients are now required to establish safer and more appropriate guidelines for drug therapy .
Crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> 10 mg versus <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in <START:Disease> migraine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Rizatriptan <END> is a selective <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ( 1 B / 1 D ) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of <START:Disease> migraine <END> .
This randomized double - blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> 10 mg tablet to 2 <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> 1 mg / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack with each therapy .
Of patients expressing a preference ( 89 . 1 % ) , more than twice as many preferred <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> to <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( 69 . 9 vs . 30 . 1 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
Faster relief of <START:Disease> headache <END> was the most important reason for preference , cited by 67 . 3 % of patients preferring <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> and 54 . 2 % of patients who preferred <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> .
The co - primary endpoint of being <START:Disease> pain <END> free at 2 h was also in favor of <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> .
Forty - nine percent of patients were <START:Disease> pain <END> free 2 h after <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> , compared with 24 . 3 % treated with <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) , <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> being superior within 1 h of treatment .
<START:Disease> Headache <END> relief at 2 h was 75 . 9 % for <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> and 47 . 3 % for <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) , with <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> being superior to <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> within 30 min of dosing .
Almost 36 % of patients taking <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> were <START:Disease> pain <END> free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h , compared to 20 % of patients on <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
<START:Chemical> Rizatriptan <END> was also superior to <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in the proportions of patients with no <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , <START:Disease> phonophobia <END> or <START:Disease> photophobia <END> and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
More patients were ( completely , very or somewhat ) satisfied 2 h after treatment with <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> ( 69 . 8 % ) than at 2 h after treatment with <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( 38 . 6 % , p < or = 0 . 001 ) .
Recurrence rates were 31 . 4 % with <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> and 15 . 3 % with <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> .
Both active treatments were well tolerated .
The most common adverse events ( incidence > or = 5 % in one group ) after <START:Chemical> rizatriptan <END> and <START:Chemical> ergotamine <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> , respectively , were <START:Disease> dizziness <END> ( 6 . 7 and 5 . 3 % ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( 4 . 2 and 8 . 5 % ) and <START:Disease> somnolence <END> ( 5 . 5 and 2 . 3 % ) .
Crescentic fibrillary <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> associated with intermittent <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> therapy for <START:Disease> pulmonary tuberculosis <END> .
This case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative crescentic <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> in a patient treated with <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> who had no other identifiable causes for developing this disease .
This patient underwent a 10 - month regimen of <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> for <START:Disease> pulmonary tuberculosis <END> and was discovered to have developed signs of severe <START:Disease> renal failure <END> five weeks after completion of therapy .
Renal biopsy revealed severe <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> with crescents , electron dense fibrillar deposits and moderate lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate .
Other possible causes of rapidly progressive <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> were investigated and ruled out .
This report documents the unusual occurrence of rapidly progressive <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> with crescents and fibrillar <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> in a patient treated with <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> .
Metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
Metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> ( mGlu ) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) .
Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes , mGlu 7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia , but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of <START:Disease> PD <END> is not known .
The effects of <START:Chemical> N , N ' - dibenzhydrylethane - 1 , 2 - diamine dihydrochloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> ) , the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu 7 receptors , were thus tested in different rodent models of <START:Disease> PD <END> .
Here , we show that oral ( 5 mg / kg ) or intrastriatal administration ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 nmol ) of <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> reverses <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> ( 2 . 5 and 5 mg / kg ) reduces <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced rotations in unilateral <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> ) - lesioned rats .
In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major <START:Disease> akinetic <END> symptoms of <START:Disease> PD <END> patients , 5 mg / kg <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> - lesioned rats .
In addition , <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> reduces the duration of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in a mGlu 7 receptor - dependent manner in wild - type but not mGlu 7 receptor knockout mice .
Higher doses of <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> ( 10 and 20 mg / kg p . o . ) have no effect on the same models of <START:Disease> PD <END> .
Overall these findings suggest that mGlu 7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> activity .
Selective ligands of mGlu 7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies .
Phase II study of the <START:Chemical> amsacrine <END> analogue <START:Chemical> CI - 921 <END> ( <START:Chemical> NSC 343499 <END> ) in <START:Disease> non - small cell lung cancer <END> .
<START:Chemical> CI - 921 <END> ( <START:Chemical> NSC 343499 <END> ; <START:Chemical> 9 - [[ 2 - methoxy - 4 - [ ( methylsulphonyl ) amino ] phenyl ] amino ] - N , 5 - dimethyl - 4 - acridinecarboxamide <END> ) is a topoisomerase II poison with high experimental antitumour activity .
It was administered by 15 min infusion to 16 evaluable patients with <START:Disease> non - small cell lung cancer <END> ( <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> ) ( 7 with no prior treatment , 9 patients in relapse following surgery / radiotherapy ) at a dose ( 648 mg / m 2 divided over 3 days , repeated every 3 weeks ) determined by phase I trial .
Patients had a median performance status of 1 ( WHO ) , and median age of 61 years .
The histology comprised <START:Disease> squamous carcinoma <END> ( 11 ) , <START:Disease> adenocarcinoma <END> ( 1 ) , mixed histology ( 2 ) , <START:Disease> bronchio - alveolar carcinoma <END> ( 1 ) and large cell <START:Disease> undifferentiated carcinoma <END> ( 1 ) .
<START:Disease> Neutropenia <END> grade greater than or equal to 3 was seen in 15 patients , <START:Disease> infections <END> with recovery in 3 , and grand mal <START:Disease> seizures <END> in 1 patient .
Grade less than or equal to 2 <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> occurred in 66 % courses and <START:Disease> phlebitis <END> in the infusion arm in 37 % . 1 patient with <START:Disease> squamous cell carcinoma <END> achieved a partial response lasting 5 months .
Further testing in this and other <START:Disease> tumour <END> types using multiple daily schedules is warranted .
Delayed institution of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> during focal <START:Disease> cerebral ischemia <END> : effect on <START:Disease> brain edema <END> .
The effect of induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> instituted after a 2 - h delay following <START:Disease> middle cerebral artery occlusion <END> ( <START:Disease> MCAO <END> ) on <START:Disease> brain edema <END> formation and histochemical injury was studied .
Under <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> anesthesia , the MCA of 14 spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats was occluded .
In the control group ( n = 7 ) , the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) was not manipulated .
In the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group ( n = 7 ) , the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after <START:Disease> MCAO <END> .
Four hours after <START:Disease> MCAO <END> , the rats were killed and the brains harvested .
The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> produced by <START:Disease> MCAO <END> .
Specific gravity ( SG ) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> territory ) .
The extent of <START:Disease> neuronal injury <END> was determined by <START:Chemical> 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium <END> staining .
In the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> core , there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups .
In the periphery of the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> territory , SG in the cortex was greater ( less <START:Disease> edema <END> accumulation ) in the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group ( 1 . 041 + / - 0 . 001 vs 1 . 039 + / - 0 . 001 , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
The area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross - sectional area of the hemisphere ) was less in the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group ( 33 + / - 3 % vs 21 + / - 2 % , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
The data indicate that <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> instituted 2 h after <START:Disease> MCAO <END> does not aggravate <START:Disease> edema <END> in the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> core , that it improves <START:Disease> edema <END> in the periphery of the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> territory , and that it reduces the area of histochemical <START:Disease> neuronal dysfunction <END> .
Anaesthetists ' nightmare : <START:Disease> masseter spasm <END> after induction in an undiagnosed case of <START:Disease> myotonia congenita <END> .
We report an undiagnosed case of <START:Disease> myotonia congenita <END> in a 24 - year - old previously healthy primigravida , who developed life threatening <START:Disease> masseter spasm <END> following a standard dose of intravenous <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> for induction of anaesthesia .
Neither the patient nor the anaesthetist was aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occurred .
Comparison of developmental <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of selective and non - selective cyclooxygenase - 2 inhibitors in CRL : ( WI ) WUBR Wistar rats -- <START:Chemical> DFU <END> and <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> study .
BACKGROUND : Cyclooxygenase ( COX ) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy .
Unlike general <START:Disease> toxicity <END> data , their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before .
The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of the non - selective ( <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> ) and selective ( <START:Chemical> DFU <END> ; <START:Chemical> 5 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - ( 3 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - ( 4 - methylsulphonyl ) phenyl - 2 ( 5 H ) - furanon <END> ) COX - 2 inhibitors .
METHODS : Drugs were separately , orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 ( GD 1 = plug day ) .
Doses were set at 0 . 3 , 3 . 0 and 30 . 0 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> and 0 . 2 , 2 . 0 and 20 . 0 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> DFU <END> .
Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined .
Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done .
The pooled statistical analysis for <START:Disease> ventricular septal ( VSD ) and midline ( MD ) defects <END> was performed for rat fetuses exposed to <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> , selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitor based on present and historic data .
RESULTS : Maternal <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , <START:Disease> intrauterine growth retardation <END> , and <START:Disease> increase of external and skeletal variations <END> were found in rats treated with the highest dose of <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> .
Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the <START:Chemical> DFU <END> developmental <START:Disease> toxicity <END> observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose .
Lack of teratogenicity was found in <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> and <START:Chemical> DFU <END> - exposed groups .
Prenatal exposure to non - selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX - 2 inhibitors .
CONCLUSION : Both selective and non - selective COX - 2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose .
Unlike <START:Chemical> DFU <END> , <START:Chemical> piroxicam <END> was also highly toxic to the dams .
Prenatal exposure to selective COX - 2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of <START:Disease> ventricular septal and midline defects <END> in rat when compared to non - selective drugs and historic control .
Case report : acute unintentional <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> intoxication .
INTRODUCTION : Intoxications with <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare .
We report an interesting case investigating a ( near ) fatal <START:Disease> poisoning <END> .
METHODS : The son of an 84 - year - old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound ' <START:Chemical> carbamylcholin <END> ' ; that is , <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> .
He bought 25 g of <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg .
<START:Chemical> Carbachol <END> concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC - mass spectrometry .
RESULTS : Minutes after oral administration , the patient developed <START:Disease> nausea <END> , sweating and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , and finally collapsed .
<START:Disease> Bradycardia <END> , cholinergic symptoms and <START:Disease> asystole <END> occurred .
Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> ( <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ) , <START:Chemical> atropine <END> and <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> was successful .
On hospital admission , blood pressure of the intubated , bradyarrhythmic patient was 100 / 65 mmHg .
Further signs were <START:Disease> hyperhidrosis <END> , <START:Disease> hypersalivation <END> , <START:Disease> bronchorrhoea <END> , and severe <START:Disease> miosis <END> ; the electrocardiographic finding was <START:Disease> atrio - ventricular dissociation <END> .
High doses of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> ( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> and <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> were necessary .
The patient was extubated 1 week later .
However , increased <START:Disease> dyspnoea <END> and <START:Disease> bronchospasm <END> necessitated reintubation .
<START:Disease> Respiratory insufficiency <END> was further worsened by <START:Disease> Proteus mirabilis infection <END> and severe bronchoconstriction .
One week later , the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward .
On the next day he died , probably as a result of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3 . 6 and 1 . 9 mg / l <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> , respectively .
The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg / l .
CONCLUSION : This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper , initiated by published , peer - reviewed research on herbals , and involved human failure in a case history , medical examination and clinical treatment .
For the first time , an analytical method for the determination of <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> in plasma and urine has been developed .
The analysed <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260 .
Especially in old patients , intensivists should consider intoxications ( with cholinergics ) as a cause of <START:Disease> acute cardiovascular failure <END> .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> of combined <START:Chemical> cephalothin <END> - <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> regimen .
Two patients developed <START:Disease> acute tubular necrosis <END> , characterized clinically by acute <START:Disease> oliguric renal failure <END> , while they were receiving a combination of <START:Chemical> cephalothin sodium <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin sulfate <END> therapy .
Patients who are given this drug regimen should be observed very carefully for early signs of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
High doses of this antibiotic combination should be avoided especially in elderly patients .
Patients with <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> should not be given this regimen .
The activation of spinal <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial <START:Chemical> morphine <END> after a noninjurious interval of <START:Disease> spinal cord ischemia <END> .
We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of <START:Chemical> N - methyl - d - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptors after neuraxial <START:Chemical> morphine <END> following a noninjurious interval of <START:Disease> aortic occlusion <END> in rats .
<START:Disease> Spinal cord ischemia <END> was induced by <START:Disease> aortic occlusion <END> for 6 min with a balloon catheter .
In a microdialysis study , 10 muL of saline ( group C ; n = 8 ) or 30 mug of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( group M ; n = 8 ) was injected intrathecally ( IT ) 0 . 5 h after reflow , and 30 mug of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( group SM ; n = 8 ) or 10 muL of saline ( group SC ; n = 8 ) was injected IT 0 . 5 h after sham operation .
Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia , before IT injection , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , and 48 h of reperfusion ( after IT injection ) .
Second , we investigated the effect of IT <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 30 mug ) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> spastic paraparesis <END> .
After IT <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
This increase persisted for 8 hrs .
IT <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> significantly reduced the number of dark - stained alpha - motoneurons after <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> spastic paraparesis <END> compared with the saline group .
These data indicate that IT <START:Chemical> morphine <END> induces <START:Disease> spastic paraparesis <END> with a concomitant increase in CSF <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> , which is involved in <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor activation .
We suggest that opioids may be <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> in the setting of <START:Disease> spinal cord ischemia <END> via <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor activation .
<START:Chemical> Thiopentone <END> pretreatment for <START:Chemical> propofol <END> injection <START:Disease> pain <END> in ambulatory patients .
This study investigated <START:Chemical> propofol <END> injection <START:Disease> pain <END> in patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia .
In a randomized , double - blind trial , 90 women were allocated to receive one of three treatments prior to induction of anaesthesia with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> .
Patients in Group C received 2 ml normal saline , Group L , 2 ml , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> 2 % ( 40 mg ) and Group T , 2 ml <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> 2 . 5 % ( 50 mg ) .
Venous discomfort was assessed with a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 5 - 15 sec after commencing <START:Chemical> propofol <END> administration using an infusion pump ( rate 1000 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) .
<START:Disease> Loss of consciousness <END> occurred in 60 - 90 sec .
Visual analogue scores ( mean + / - SD ) during induction were lower in Groups L ( 3 . 3 + / - 2 . 5 ) and T ( 4 . 1 + / - 2 . 7 ) than in Group C ( 5 . 6 + / - 2 . 3 ) ; P = 0 . 0031 .
The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L ( 76 . 6 % ; P < 0 . 05 ) than in Group C ( 100 % ) but not different from Group T ( 90 % ) .
The VAS scores for recall of <START:Disease> pain <END> in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction ( r = 0 . 7045 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Recovery room discharge times were similar : C ( 75 . 9 + / - 19 . 4 min ) ; L 73 . 6 + / - 21 . 6 min ) ; T ( 77 . 1 + / - 18 . 9 min ) .
Assessing their overall satisfaction , 89 . 7 % would choose <START:Chemical> propofol <END> anaesthesia again .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> reduces the incidence and severity of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> injection <START:Disease> pain <END> in ambulatory patients whereas <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> only reduces its severity .
Mouse strain - dependent effect of <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> on motility and brain biogenic <START:Chemical> amines <END> .
The effect of <START:Chemical> amantadine hydrochloride <END> , injected i . p . in 6 increments of 100 mg / kg each over 30 hr , on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic <START:Chemical> amines <END> and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mice .
These were the albino Sprague - Dawley ICR and BALB / C , the black C 57 BL / 6 and the brown CDF - I mouse strains .
<START:Chemical> Amantadine <END> treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse motility .
The initial dose of <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> <START:Disease> depressed <END> locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the BALB / C mice being the most sensitive .
Subsequent <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the BALB / C mice being the least sensitive .
The locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied , except for the ICR mice , during an overnight drug - free period following the fourth <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> treatment .
Readministration of <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> , after a drug - free overnight period , increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the BALB / C mice where <START:Disease> suppression of motility <END> occurred .
Treatment with <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> did not alter whole brain <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> levels but decreased the amounts of <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid <END> in the BALB / C mice compared to saline control .
Conversely , brain <START:Chemical> normetanephrine <END> concentration was increased from saline control by <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> in the BALB / C mice .
The results suggest a strain - dependent effect of <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens used .
The BALB / C mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> .
The biochemical results of brain biogenic <START:Chemical> amines <END> of BALB / C mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> turnover rate and / or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in O - methylation of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> which may account for a <START:Disease> behavioral depression <END> caused by <START:Chemical> amantadine <END> in the BALB / C mice .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> reversal of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> due to <START:Chemical> captopril <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The hemodynamic effects of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> and other <START:Chemical> angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors <END> may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system .
The opioid antagonist <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> has been shown to block or reverse the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> actions of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> .
We report a case of an intentional <START:Chemical> captopril <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , manifested by marked <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , that resolved promptly with the administration of <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> treated with <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
Our experience demonstrates a possible role of <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> in the reversal of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> resulting from <START:Chemical> captopril <END> .
Enhanced stimulus - induced neurotransmitter overflow in <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor activation .
The present study examines the effect of 6 - day <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment ( 100 micrograms / kg per h , s . c . ) on stimulus - induced ( 1 Hz ) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle - and <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - treated rats .
Renal <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> stores and stimulus - induced overflow in the vehicle - treated group consisted of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> only .
However , <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment resulted in the incorporation of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> into renal <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> stores such that approximately 40 % of the <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> present was <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> while the <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> content was reduced by a similar degree .
Total tissue <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged .
Stimulus - induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> and <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> in proportions similar to those found in the kidney .
This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade .
<START:Chemical> Propranolol <END> had no effect on stimulus - induced overflow in either group .
<START:Chemical> Phentolamine <END> increased stimulus - induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - treated group .
In conclusion , chronic <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow .
However , neither alterations in prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration .
Furthermore , data obtained with <START:Chemical> phentolamine <END> alone do not suggest alpha - adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment .
On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> produced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in rats .
The development of tolerance to the <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> produced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> was studied in rats .
Saline - pretreated controls given a test dose of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( 20 mg / kg i . p . ) showed a pronounced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram .
Rats treated for 11 days with <START:Chemical> morphine <END> and withdrawn for 36 - 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a <START:Disease> rigidity <END> after the test dose of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> that was not significantly less than in the controls and were <START:Disease> akinetic <END> ( A group ) .
The other rats showed a strong decrease in the <START:Disease> rigidity <END> and the occurrence of stereotyped ( S ) licking and / or gnawing in presence of <START:Disease> akinetic <END> or <START:Disease> hyperkinetic <END> ( K ) behaviour ( AS / KS group ) , suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation .
The <START:Disease> rigidity <END> was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days ' treatment .
In a further series of experiments , <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 0 . 2 mg / kg i . p . ) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the <START:Disease> rigidity <END> without any dopaminergic interference .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> enhanced the <START:Disease> rigidity <END> in the A group .
However , the level in the AS / KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group .
The results suggest that <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , which is assumed to be due to an action of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum .
Nevertheless , there occurs some real tolerance to this effect .
The rapid alternations of <START:Disease> rigidity <END> and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS / KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA - innervated structures .
<START:Chemical> Amphotericin B <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> AIDS <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of multiple episodes of <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity in an <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patent following <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> infusion .
CASE SUMMARY : A 46 - year - old African - American man experienced recurrent <START:Disease> grand mal seizures <END> during intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> , then petit mal <START:Disease> seizures <END> as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time .
The patients concurrent medications included <START:Chemical> didanosine <END> , <START:Chemical> hydroxyzine <END> , <START:Chemical> promethazine <END> , <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> , and <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> .
Despite administration of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> and <START:Chemical> lorazepam <END> , the <START:Disease> seizures <END> persisted and occurred only during <START:Chemical> amphotercin B <END> administration .
DISCUSSION : <START:Disease> AIDS <END> and <START:Disease> cryptococcal meningitis <END> , both of which the patient had , can potentially cause <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The patient had a history of <START:Disease> alcohol abuse <END> ; <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> intake as well as withdrawal can also cause <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
<START:Chemical> Didanosine <END> also has a potential for inducing <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
However , these other potential causes of <START:Disease> seizure <END> were ruled out .
The time course of events suggested that <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> was the cause of the <START:Disease> seizures <END> in this <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patient .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Amphotericin B <END> seems to be the probable cause of the <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
To date , only three cases of <START:Disease> seizures <END> associated with <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> have been reported in the literature , but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect .
Microinjection of <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> into the CA 1 region of hippocampus improves <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> in adult male rats .
The effect of <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> ( 5 - HT 2 antagonist ) on <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( muscarinic cholinergic antagonist ) - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> in Morris water maze ( MWM ) was investigated .
Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA 1 region of the hippocampus .
One week later , they received repeatedly vehicles ( saline , <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> , saline + <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> ) , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl saline / side ; 30 min before training ) , <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> ( 2 , 4 and 8 microg / 0 . 5 microl <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> / side ; 20 min before training ) and <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl ; 30 min before <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> injection ) + <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> ) through cannulae each day .
Animals were tested for four consecutive days ( 4 trial / day ) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged .
In the fifth day , the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor , motivational and visual systems .
The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - treated group as compared to saline group .
<START:Chemical> Ritanserin <END> - treated rats ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl / side ) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> - treated group .
However , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> and <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> co - administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - treated rats .
Our findings show that microinjection of <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> into the CA 1 region of the hippocampus improves the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> L - alpha - glyceryl - phosphorylcholine <END> on <START:Disease> amnesia <END> caused by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> .
The present study was carried out to test the effects of <START:Chemical> L - alpha - glycerylphosphorylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - alpha - GFC <END> ) on <START:Disease> memory impairment <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> in man .
Thirty - two healthy young volunteers were randomly allocated to four different groups .
They were given a ten day pretreatment with either <START:Chemical> L - alpha - GFC <END> or placebo , p . o . , and on the eleventh day either <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> or placebo , i . m . Before and 0 . 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 h after injection the subjects were given attention and mnemonic tests .
The findings of this study indicate that the drug is able to antagonize <START:Disease> impairment of attention and memory <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> .
Immediate <START:Disease> allergic reactions <END> to <START:Chemical> amoxicillin <END> .
A large group of patients with suspected <START:Disease> allergic reactions <END> to <START:Chemical> beta - lactam <END> antibiotics was evaluated .
A detailed clinical history , together with skin tests , RAST ( radioallergosorbent test ) , and controlled challenge tests , was used to establish whether patients <START:Disease> allergic <END> to <START:Chemical> beta - lactam <END> antibiotics had selective immediate <START:Disease> allergic <END> responses to <START:Chemical> amoxicillin <END> ( <START:Chemical> AX <END> ) or were cross - reacting with other <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> derivatives .
Skin tests were performed with <START:Chemical> benzylpenicilloyl - poly - L - lysine <END> ( <START:Chemical> BPO - PLL <END> ) , <START:Chemical> benzylpenicilloate <END> , <START:Chemical> benzylpenicillin <END> ( <START:Chemical> PG <END> ) , <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> ( <START:Chemical> AMP <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> AX <END> .
RAST for <START:Chemical> BPO - PLL <END> and <START:Chemical> AX <END> - PLL was done .
When both skin test and RAST for <START:Chemical> BPO <END> were negative , single - blind , placebo - controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of <START:Chemical> PG <END> or sensitivity to <START:Chemical> AX <END> .
A total of 177 patients were diagnosed as <START:Disease> allergic <END> to <START:Chemical> beta - lactam <END> antibiotics .
We selected the 54 ( 30 . 5 % ) cases of immediate <START:Chemical> AX <END> <START:Disease> allergy <END> with good tolerance of <START:Chemical> PG <END> .
<START:Disease> Anaphylaxis <END> was seen in 37 patients ( 69 % ) , the other 17 ( 31 % ) having <START:Disease> urticaria <END> and / or <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
All the patients were skin test negative to <START:Chemical> BPO <END> ; 49 of 51 ( 96 % ) were also negative to <START:Disease> MDM <END> , and 44 of 46 ( 96 % ) to <START:Chemical> PG <END> .
Skin tests with <START:Chemical> AX <END> were positive in 34 ( 63 % ) patients .
RAST was positive for <START:Chemical> AX <END> in 22 patients ( 41 % ) and to <START:Chemical> BPO <END> in just 5 ( 9 % ) .
None of the sera with negative RAST for <START:Chemical> AX <END> were positive to <START:Chemical> BPO <END> .
Challenge tests with <START:Chemical> AX <END> were performed in 23 subjects ( 43 % ) to establish the diagnosis of immediate <START:Disease> allergic reaction <END> to <START:Chemical> AX <END> , and in 15 cases ( 28 % ) both skin test and RAST for <START:Chemical> AX <END> were negative .
<START:Chemical> PG <END> was well tolerated by all 54 patients .
We describe the largest group of <START:Chemical> AX <END> - <START:Disease> allergic <END> patients who have tolerated <START:Chemical> PG <END> reported so far .
Diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific <START:Chemical> AX <END> - related reagents are employed .
Further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods .
Incidence of <START:Disease> neoplasms <END> in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> exposed to different treatment regimens .
Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
The drugs commonly used are <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> and <START:Chemical> chlorambucil <END> ( <START:Chemical> alkylating agents <END> ) , <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> ( <START:Chemical> purine <END> analogue ) , and <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> ( <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> analogue ) .
There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce <START:Disease> synovitis <END> , but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped .
Since adverse reactions are frequent , less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year .
Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects , those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it .
Patients treated with <START:Chemical> alkylating agents <END> have an increased risk of development of <START:Disease> acute nonlymphocytic leukemia <END> , and both <START:Chemical> alkylating agents <END> and <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> are associated with the development of <START:Disease> non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> therapy increases the risk of <START:Disease> carcinoma of the bladder <END> .
There have been several long - term studies of patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> and the incidence of most of the common <START:Disease> cancers <END> is not increased .
Data on the possible increased risk of <START:Disease> malignancy <END> in <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> are still being collected , and until further information is available , the use of immunosuppressive drugs , particularly <START:Chemical> alkylating agents <END> , in the treatment of <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life - threatening complications .
<START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> - associated <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> .
INTRODUCTION : <START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> is used in the treatment of <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> , which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia , and can be associated with permanent <START:Disease> visual loss <END> .
We report 3 cases which presented with <START:Disease> bitemporal hemianopia <END> .
CLINICAL PICTURE : Three patients with <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> - associated toxic <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> are described .
All 3 patients had <START:Disease> loss of central visual acuity , colour vision ( Ishihara ) and visual field <END> .
The <START:Disease> visual field loss <END> had a bitemporal flavour , suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm .
TREATMENT : Despite stopping <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> on diagnosis , visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months .
Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases .
In the third case , visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale .
OUTCOME : All 3 patients had some permanent <START:Disease> loss of visual function <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> usage is associated with permanent <START:Disease> visual loss <END> and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up .
The author postulates that in cases of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> associated chiasmopathy , <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm .
<START:Chemical> Ifosfamide <END> <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> presenting with <START:Disease> asterixis <END> .
CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> IFX <END> ) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use .
We report a case of a 51 - year - old man who developed severe , disabling negative <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> for <START:Disease> plasmacytoma <END> .
He was awake , revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms .
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal <START:Disease> structural lesions of the brain <END> and <START:Disease> metabolic abnormalities <END> .
An electroencephalogram showed continuous , generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> .
The administration of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> was discontinued and within 12 h the <START:Disease> asterixis <END> resolved completely .
In the patient described , the presence of <START:Disease> asterixis <END> during infusion of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> , normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> is associated with the use of <START:Chemical> IFX <END> .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) damages <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated .
Cardona et al . [ Nat . Neurosci . 9 ( 2006 ) , 917 ] recently identified the microglial - specific fractalkine receptor ( CX 3 CR 1 ) as an important mediator of <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurodegeneration <END> of <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurons .
Because the <START:Disease> CNS damage <END> caused by <START:Chemical> METH <END> and <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> is highly selective for the <START:Chemical> DA <END> neuronal system in mouse models of <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> , we hypothesized that the CX 3 CR 1 plays a role in <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> and microglial activation .
Mice in which the CX 3 CR 1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein ( eGFP ) were treated with <START:Chemical> METH <END> and examined for striatal <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> METH <END> depleted <START:Chemical> DA <END> , caused microglial activation , and increased body temperature in CX 3 CR 1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild - type controls .
The effects of <START:Chemical> METH <END> in CX 3 CR 1 knockout mice were not gender - dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum .
Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after <START:Chemical> METH <END> that are characteristic of activation .
This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
We conclude from these studies that CX 3 CR 1 signaling does not modulate <START:Chemical> METH <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> or microglial activation .
Furthermore , it appears that striatal - resident microglia respond to <START:Chemical> METH <END> with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration .
<START:Disease> Transient neurologic symptoms <END> after spinal anesthesia : a lower incidence with <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> than with <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> .
BACKGROUND : Recent evidence suggests that <START:Disease> transient neurologic symptoms <END> ( <START:Disease> TNSs <END> ) frequently follow <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
However , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal .
<START:Chemical> Prilocaine <END> is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> .
Accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> with <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> with respect to duration of action and relative risk of <START:Disease> TNSs <END> .
METHODS : Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2 . 5 ml 2 % <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> in 7 . 5 % <START:Chemical> glucose <END> , 2 % <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> in 7 . 5 % <START:Chemical> glucose <END> , or 0 . 5 % <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> in 7 . 5 % <START:Chemical> glucose <END> .
All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy .
Details of spinal puncture , extension and regression of spinal block , and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted .
In the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for <START:Disease> TNSs <END> by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure .
RESULTS : Nine of 30 patients receiving <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> experienced <START:Disease> TNSs <END> , 1 of 30 patients receiving <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> ( P = 0 . 03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients receiving <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> had <START:Disease> TNSs <END> .
Times to ambulate and to void were similar after <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> ( 150 vs . 165 min and 238 vs . 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Prilocaine <END> may be preferable to <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of <START:Disease> TNSs <END> .
Assessment of the onset and persistence of <START:Disease> amnesia <END> during procedural sedation with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> , and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index ( BIS ) monitoring .
METHODS : This was a prospective , single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> between December 28 , 2002 , and October 31 , 2003 .
BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status .
At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation , until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure , a word from a standardized list was read aloud , and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator .
The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient ' s ability to repeat the word were recorded .
After the procedure , the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall , and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed .
RESULTS : Seventy - five consenting patients were enrolled ; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation .
No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations .
The mean ( + / - standard deviation ) time of data collection was 16 . 4 minutes ( + / - 7 . 1 ; range 5 to 34 minutes ) .
The mean initial ( preprocedure ) BIS score was 97 . 1 ( + / - 2 . 3 ; range 92 to 99 ) .
The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66 . 9 ( + / - 14 . 4 ; range 33 to 91 ) .
The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77 . 1 ( 95 % CI = 74 . 3 to 80 . 0 ) .
The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the <START:Disease> inability to repeat words <END> was 81 . 5 ( 95 % CI = 78 . 1 to 84 . 8 ) .
The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96 . 7 ( + / - 2 . 4 ; range 84 to 98 ) .
The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 88 . 1 to 94 . 3 ) .
All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol .
The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91 . 5 ( + / - 11 . 1 ; range 79 to 98 ) , and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90 .
CONCLUSIONS : There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words .
Furthermore , patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation , suggestive of <START:Disease> retrograde amnesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> , <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , and <START:Chemical> gemcitabine <END> combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic <START:Disease> nonsmall cell lung carcinoma <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Cisplatin <END> - based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced <START:Disease> nonsmall cell lung carcinoma <END> ( <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> ) .
The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease .
METHODS : The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility , response rate , and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of a <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> , <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , and <START:Chemical> gemcitabine <END> combination to treat metastatic <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
Thirty - five consecutive chemotherapy - naive patients with Stage IV <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 - 2 were treated with a combination of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> ( 135 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 3 hours ) on Day 1 , <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( 120 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 6 hours ) on Day 1 , and <START:Chemical> gemcitabine <END> ( 800 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 30 minutes ) on Days 1 and 8 , every 4 weeks .
Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second - line chemotherapy after disease progression , the response and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given .
RESULTS : All the patients were examined for <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ; 34 were examinable for response .
An objective response was observed in 73 . 5 % of the patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 55 . 6 - 87 . 1 % ) , including 4 complete responses ( 11 . 7 % ) .
According to intention - to - treat , the overall response rate was 71 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 53 . 7 - 85 . 4 % ) .
After 154 courses of therapy , the median dose intensity was 131 mg / m ( 2 ) for <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> ( 97 . 3 % ) , 117 mg / m ( 2 ) for <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( 97 . 3 % ) , and 1378 mg / m ( 2 ) for <START:Chemical> gemcitabine <END> ( 86 . 2 % ) .
World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> occurred in 39 . 9 % and 11 . 4 % of patients , respectively .
There was one treatment - related <START:Disease> death <END> .
Nonhematologic <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were mild .
After a median follow - up of 22 months , the median progression free survival rate was 7 months , and the median survival time was 16 months .
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> , <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , and <START:Chemical> gemcitabine <END> is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
This treatment merits further comparison with other <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> - based regimens .
Transient <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> following unilateral <START:Disease> substantia nigra lesion <END> reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
Following unilateral <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> induced <START:Disease> SN lesion <END> , a transient period of <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> has been reported to precede the predominant <START:Disease> ipsilateral circling <END> .
In order to clarify the nature of this initial <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> rotational behavior <END> .
Three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion .
Such <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool , or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons .
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> .
However , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> rotation <END> tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> injections .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> has an irreversible effect on the post - lesion DA pool contributing to <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Clarithromycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Clarithromycin <END> is a relatively new <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antibiotic that offers twice - daily dosing .
It differs from <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6 .
Although the side - effect profile of <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> is established , including <START:Disease> gastroenteritis <END> and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed - function oxidase metabolism , experience with the newer <START:Chemical> macrolides <END> is still being recorded .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxicity <END> has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> but has never been reported with the newer <START:Chemical> macrolides <END> .
We report a case of <START:Disease> ventricular dysrhythmias <END> that occurred after six therapeutic doses of <START:Chemical> clarithromycin <END> .
The <START:Disease> dysrhythmias <END> resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbital <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> in a <START:Disease> neurologically - impaired <END> child .
A 2 - year - old child with known <START:Disease> neurologic impairment <END> developed a <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> soon after starting <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> therapy for <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Known causes of <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> were eliminated after evaluation .
On repeat challenge with <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> , the <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> recurred .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbital <END> should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor <START:Chemical> N 10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , <START:Chemical> N 10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid <END> , is a tight - binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) whose <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme .
Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> polyglutamates .
Following a 12 - hour exposure of L 1210 cells to 50 microM [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , 30 % of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> tetra - and pentaglutamate , as determined by high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyses .
As inhibitors of isolated L 1210 TS , CB 3717 di - , tri - , tetra - and pentaglutamate are 26 - , 87 - , 119 - and 114 - fold more potent than <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , respectively , and their formation may , therefore , be an important determinant of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> .
In early clinical studies with <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , activity has been seen in <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> , <START:Disease> hepatoma <END> , and <START:Disease> mesothelioma <END> .
<START:Disease> Toxicities <END> included <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , <START:Disease> malaise <END> , and dose - limiting <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> under acidic conditions .
In an attempt to overcome this problem , a clinical trial of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> administered with alkaline diuresis is under way .
Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg / m 2 suggest that a reduction in <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> may have been achieved with only 1 instance of <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> in 10 patients .
<START:Disease> Hepatotoxicity <END> and <START:Disease> malaise <END> are again the most frequent side effects .
Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients .
Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved .
<START:Disease> Tremor <END> side effects of <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> , quantified by a laser pointer technique .
OBJECTIVE : To study <START:Disease> tremor <END> side effects of <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> an easily applicable , quick and low - priced method is needed .
A new method using a commercially available , pen - shaped laser pointer was developed .
Aim of the study was to determine sensitivity , reproducibility , reference values and the agreement with a questionnaire .
METHODS : <START:Disease> Tremor <END> was measured using a laser pointer technique .
To determine sensitivity we assessed <START:Disease> tremor <END> in 44 patients with <START:Disease> obstructive lung disease <END> after administration of cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> .
Subjects were asked to aim at the centre of a target , subdivided in concentric circles , from 5 m distance .
The circle in which the participant succeeded to aim was recorded in millimetres radius .
In another series of measurements , reproducibility and reference values of the <START:Disease> tremor <END> was assessed in 65 healthy subjects in three sessions , at 9 a . m . , 4 p . m . and 9 a . m . , respectively , 1 week later .
Postural <START:Disease> tremor <END> was measured with the arm horizontally outstretched rest <START:Disease> tremor <END> with the arm supported by an armrest and finally <START:Disease> tremor <END> was measured after holding a 2 - kg weight until exhaustion .
Inter - observer variability was measured in a series of 10 healthy subjects .
<START:Disease> Tremor <END> was measured simultaneously by two independent observers .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Salbutamol <END> significantly increased <START:Disease> tremor <END> severity in patients in a dose - dependent way .
Within healthy adults no age - dependency could be found ( b = 0 . 262 mm / year ; P = 0 . 72 ) .
There was no agreement between the questionnaire and <START:Disease> tremor <END> severity ( r = 0 . 093 ; P = 0 . 53 ) .
Postural <START:Disease> tremor <END> showed no significant difference between the first and third session ( P = 0 . 07 ) .
Support of the arm decreased <START:Disease> tremor <END> severity , exhaustion increased <START:Disease> tremor <END> severity significantly .
A good agreement was found between two independent observers ( interclass correlation coefficient 0 . 72 ) .
DISCUSSION : Quantifying <START:Disease> tremor <END> by using an inexpensive laser pointer is , with the exception of children ( < 12 years ) a sensitive and reproducible method .
A phase I study of <START:Chemical> 4 ' - 0 - tetrahydropyranyladriamycin <END> .
Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics .
A Phase I study of intravenous ( IV ) bolus <START:Chemical> 4 ' - 0 - tetrahydropyranyladriamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> Pirarubicin <END> ) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
Twenty - six had minimal prior therapy ( good risk ) , 23 had extensive prior therapy ( poor risk ) , and six had <START:Disease> renal and / or hepatic dysfunction <END> .
A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg / m 2 were evaluable .
Maximum tolerated dose in good - risk patients was 70 mg / m 2 , and in poor - risk patients , 60 mg / m 2 .
The dose - limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative <START:Disease> granulocytopenia <END> .
Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 ( range , 4 - 22 ) .
Less frequent toxic effects included <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:Disease> anemia <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , mild <START:Disease> alopecia <END> , <START:Disease> phlebitis <END> , and <START:Disease> mucositis <END> .
<START:Disease> Myelosuppression <END> was more in patients with <START:Disease> hepatic dysfunction <END> .
Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed <START:Chemical> Pirarubicin <END> plasma T 1 / 2 alpha ( + / - SE ) of 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 85 minutes , T beta 1 / 2 of 25 . 6 + / - 6 . 5 minutes , and T 1 / 2 gamma of 23 . 6 + / - 7 . 6 hours .
The area under the curve was 537 + / - 149 ng / ml x hours , volume of distribution ( Vd ) 3504 + / - 644 l / m 2 , and total clearance ( ClT ) was 204 + 39 . 3 l / hour / m 2 .
<START:Chemical> Adriamycinol <END> , <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> , <START:Chemical> adriamycinone <END> , and <START:Chemical> tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol <END> were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> was less than or equal to 10 % of the total metabolites .
Urinary excretion of <START:Chemical> Pirarubicin <END> in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10 % .
Activity was noted in <START:Disease> mesothelioma <END> , <START:Disease> leiomyosarcoma <END> , and <START:Disease> basal cell carcinoma <END> .
The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg / m 2 IV bolus every 3 weeks .
Reduced <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel density , altered voltage dependence of inactivation , and increased susceptibility to <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice lacking <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel beta 2 - subunits .
<START:Chemical> Sodium <END> channel beta - subunits modulate channel gating , assembly , and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems .
We generated beta 2 ( - / - ) mice to investigate the role of beta 2 in control of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel density , localization , and function in neurons in vivo .
Measurements of [ ( 3 ) H ] <START:Chemical> saxitoxin <END> ( <START:Chemical> STX <END> ) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channels in beta 2 ( - / - ) neurons .
The loss of beta 2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in <START:Chemical> sodium <END> current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons .
The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced , and the threshold for action potential generation was increased , indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channels .
In contrast , the conduction velocity , the number and size of axons in the optic nerve , and the specific localization of <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( v ) 1 . 6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged .
beta 2 ( - / - ) mice displayed increased susceptibility to <START:Disease> seizures <END> , as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , but seemed normal in other neurological tests .
Our observations show that beta 2 - subunits play an important role in the regulation of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> to <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> presenting with a <START:Disease> leukemoid reaction <END> , <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> , <START:Disease> erythroderma <END> , and <START:Disease> renal failure <END> .
We report a patient in whom <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> to <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> presented with generalized <START:Disease> erythroderma <END> , a severe <START:Disease> leukemoid reaction <END> , <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> , <START:Disease> hyponatremia <END> , and <START:Disease> renal failure <END> .
This is the first report of such an unusual reaction to <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> .
The <START:Chemical> glycine <END> transporter - 1 inhibitor <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> displays a selective and specific antipsychotic - like profile in normal and transgenic mice .
<START:Disease> Schizophrenia <END> has been initially associated with dysfunction in <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> neurotransmission .
However , the observation that antagonists of the <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptor produce <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor .
As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor .
Among them are <START:Chemical> glycine <END> transporter - 1 ( GlyT 1 ) inhibitors such as <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> , which indirectly enhance <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor function by increasing the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> ( a co - agonist for the <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor ) levels in the synapse .
This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> , with a particular focus on models of <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> , involving either drug challenge ( ie , <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> and <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ) or transgenic mice ( ie , <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> Nr 1 ( neo - / - ) and DAT ( - / - )) .
Results showed that <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) blocked <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> induced by the non - competitive <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor antagonist , <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> and partially reversed spontaneous <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> Nr 1 ( neo - / - ) mice .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> failed to affect <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> or naturally observed in <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> transporter ( DAT ( - / - )) knockout mice ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) .
Importantly , both classical ( <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ) and atypical ( <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> , <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> and <START:Chemical> aripiprazole <END> ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
However , unlike these latter , <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> did not produce <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p . o .
Together these findings show that the GlyT 1 inhibitor , <START:Chemical> SSR 103800 <END> , produces antipsychotic - like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system , and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs .
<START:Chemical> Valproate <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Valproate <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> is a rare syndrome that may manifest in otherwise normal <START:Disease> epileptic <END> individuals .
It may even present in patients who have tolerated this medicine well in the past .
It is usually but not necessarily associated with <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> .
The EEG shows characteristic triphasic waves in most patients with this complication .
A case of <START:Chemical> valproate <END> - induced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> is presented .
The problems in diagnosing this condition are subsequently discussed .
<START:Disease> Sinus arrest <END> associated with continuous - infusion <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
The administration of intermittent intravenous infusions of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> is infrequently associated with the development of <START:Disease> bradyarrhythmias <END> .
A 40 - year - old man with <START:Disease> leukemia <END> and no history of <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> developed recurrent , brief episodes of apparent <START:Disease> sinus arrest <END> while receiving continuous - infusion <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> 50 mg / hour .
The <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> were temporally related to <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> administration , disappeared after dechallenge , and did not recur during <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> treatment .
This is the first reported case of <START:Disease> sinus arrest <END> associated with continuous - infusion <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
Antihypertensive drugs and <START:Disease> depression <END> : a reappraisal .
Eighty - nine new referral <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> out - patients and 46 new referral non - <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> chronically physically ill out - patients completed a mood rating scale at regular intervals for one year .
The results showed a high prevalence of <START:Disease> depression <END> in both groups of patients , with no preponderance in the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group .
<START:Disease> Hypertensive <END> patients with <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> histories had a higher prevalence of <START:Disease> depression <END> than the comparison patients .
This was accounted for by a significant number of <START:Disease> depressions <END> occurring in <START:Chemical> methyl dopa <END> treated patients with <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> histories .
Reversal of neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> by novel <START:Chemical> aryl - piperazine <END> anxiolytic drugs .
The novel anxiolytic drug , <START:Chemical> buspirone <END> , reverses <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
A series of <START:Chemical> aryl - piperazine <END> analogues of <START:Chemical> buspirone <END> and other <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptaminergic agonists <END> were tested for their ability to reverse <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
Those drugs with strong affinity for <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamine <END> 1 a receptors were able to reverse <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
Drugs with affinity for other <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> receptors or weak affinity were ineffective .
However , inhibition of postsynaptic <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect .
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors .
Current clinical experience .
<START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> and <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> are the 2 best - known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors .
Clinical experience with <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> includes over 5000 patients , 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more , and experience with <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> includes over 3500 patients , of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more .
<START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months .
Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy , with reductions in total <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> of over 30 % and in LDL - <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> of 40 % in clinical studies .
Modest increases in HDL - <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> levels of about 10 % are also reported .
Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good , with fewer than 3 % of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences .
Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term ( up to 2 years ) cataractogenic potential .
One to 2 % of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal .
These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued .
Minor elevations of <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase levels are reported in about 5 % of patients .
<START:Disease> Myopathy <END> , associated in some cases with <START:Disease> myoglobinuria <END> , and in 2 cases with transient <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , has been rarely reported with <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> , especially in patients concomitantly treated with <START:Chemical> cyclosporin <END> , <START:Chemical> gemfibrozil <END> or <START:Chemical> niacin <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> and <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> are both effective and well - tolerated agents for lowering elevated levels of serum <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> .
As wider use confirms their safety profile , they will gain increasing importance in the therapeutic approach to <START:Disease> hypercholesterolaemia <END> and its consequences .
Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:Chemical> iodine - 125 - metaiodobenzylguanidine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> ) , an analog of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ( <START:Chemical> NE <END> ) , serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function .
Using a rat model of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose - dependently in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
The degree of <START:Disease> vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells <END> was analyzed in relation to the duration of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> treatment ( 2 mg / kg , once a week ) .
There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1 - or 2 - wk treatment groups , isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3 - wk group , frequent scattered degeneration in the 4 - wk group , scattered or focal degeneration in the 5 - wk group , and extensive degeneration in the 8 - wk group .
Myocardial accumulation of [ 125 I ] <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less .
However , the 4 - wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall ( 82 % of the control ) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0 . 05 ) .
In the 5 - wk group , <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35 % and 27 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
In the 8 - wk group , <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18 % and 14 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
Thus , <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> dose - dependent manner .
The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight <START:Disease> myocardial impairment <END> ( scattered or focal <START:Disease> vacuolar degeneration <END> ) indicates that <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
Systolic pressure variation is greater during <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> than during <START:Chemical> sodium nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in ventilated dogs .
The systolic pressure variation ( SPV ) , which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) after one positive - pressure breath , was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> HEM <END> , n = 7 ) or by continuous infusion of <START:Chemical> sodium nitroprusside <END> ( <START:Chemical> SNP <END> , n = 7 ) .
During <START:Disease> HEM <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the <START:Chemical> SNP <END> group .
The systemic , central venous , pulmonary capillary wedge pressures , and heart rates , were similar in the two groups .
Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups .
The SPV during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> was 15 . 7 + / - 6 . 7 mm Hg in the <START:Disease> HEM <END> group , compared with 9 . 1 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg in the <START:Chemical> SNP <END> group ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
The delta down , which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath , was 20 . 3 + / - 8 . 4 and 10 . 1 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg in the <START:Disease> HEM <END> and <START:Chemical> SNP <END> groups , respectively , during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( P less than 0 . 02 ) .
It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> state due to a predominant decrease in preload .
They are thus more important during absolute <START:Disease> hypovolemia <END> than during deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Adverse reactions to <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> for the treatment of mild <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate <START:Disease> Hypertension <END> .
Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild <START:Disease> hypertension <END> are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups : <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> , <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , or a placebo for either of these drugs .
The trial is single - blind .
23 582 patient - years of observation have been completed so far , 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos .
The results show an association between <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> treatment and <START:Disease> impotence <END> , and <START:Disease> impotence <END> also occurred more frequently in patients taking <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> than in those taking placebos .
Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include <START:Disease> impaired glucose tolerance <END> in men and women and <START:Disease> gout <END> in men , associated with <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> treatment , and <START:Disease> Raynaud ' s phenomenon <END> and <START:Disease> dyspnoea <END> in men and women taking <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> .
No <START:Disease> corneal disease <END> is known to have occurred in the <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> group .
Mean serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> level fell , and <START:Chemical> urea <END> and <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> levels rose , in men and women taking <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> .
In the <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> group , serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> and <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> levels rose in both sexes , but the <START:Chemical> urea <END> level rose significantly in women only .
Components of lemon essential oil attenuate <START:Disease> dementia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> .
The anti - <START:Disease> dementia <END> effects of <START:Chemical> s - limonene <END> and <START:Chemical> s - perillyl alcohol <END> were observed using the passive avoidance test ( PA ) and the open field habituation test ( OFH ) .
These lemon essential oils showed strong ability to improve <START:Disease> memory impaired <END> by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ; however , <START:Chemical> s - perillyl alcohol <END> relieved the <START:Disease> deficit of associative memory <END> in PA only , and did not improve non - associative memory significantly in OFH .
Analysis of neurotransmitter concentration in some brain regions on the test day showed that <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> concentration of the vehicle / <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> group was significantly lower than that of the vehicle / vehicle group , but this phenomenon was reversed when <START:Chemical> s - limonene <END> or <START:Chemical> s - perillyl alcohol <END> were administered before the injection of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> .
Simultaneously , we found that these two lemon essential oil components could inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro using the Ellman method .
Risk factors of <START:Disease> sensorineural hearing loss <END> in preterm infants .
Among 547 preterm infants of < or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991 , 8 children ( 1 . 46 % ) developed severe progressive and bilateral <START:Disease> sensorineural hearing loss <END> .
Perinatal risk factors of infants with <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complications .
Our observations demonstrated an association of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> with a higher incidence of perinatal complications .
<START:Disease> Ototoxicity <END> appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of <START:Disease> ototoxic <END> drugs , particularly <START:Chemical> aminoglycosides <END> and <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> .
Finally , we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audiologic assessment in sick preterm children as <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe .
Reduction in injection <START:Disease> pain <END> using buffered <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheterization .
Previous reports have suggested that <START:Disease> pain <END> associated with the injection of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> is related to the acidic pH of the solution .
To determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the pH of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> into the physiologic range would reduce <START:Disease> pain <END> during injection , we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization .
Twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of <START:Disease> pain <END> after receiving standard <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> in one femoral area and buffered <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> in the opposite femoral area .
The mean <START:Disease> pain <END> score for buffered <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> was significantly lower than the mean score for standard <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 2 . 7 + / - 1 . 9 vs . 3 . 8 + / - 2 . 2 , P = 0 . 03 ) .
The pH adjustment of standard <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the <START:Disease> pain <END> occurring during the infiltration of tissues .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> and cardiac protection for non - cardiac surgery : a meta - analysis of randomised controlled trials .
We conducted a systematic review of the effects of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> on cardiac outcomes following non - cardiac surgery .
We included prospective , randomised peri - operative studies of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> that reported mortality , cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events .
A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007 .
The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials .
Of 425 studies identified , 20 were included in the meta - analysis ( 840 patients ) .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes ; all - cause mortality ( OR 0 . 27 , 95 % CI 0 . 01 - 7 . 13 , p = 0 . 44 ) , non - fatal <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( OR 0 . 26 , 95 % CI 0 . 04 - 1 . 60 , p = 0 . 14 ) , and <START:Disease> myocardial ischaemia <END> ( OR 0 . 65 , 95 % CI 0 . 26 - 1 . 63 , p = 0 . 36 ) .
Peri - operative <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( 26 % , OR 3 . 80 , 95 % CI 1 . 91 - 7 . 54 , p = 0 . 0001 ) and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> ( 17 % , OR 5 . 45 , 95 % CI 2 . 98 - 9 . 95 , p < 0 . 00001 ) were significantly increased .
An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> ( p = 0 . 43 ) .
A randomised placebo - controlled trial of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> is warranted .
Calcineurin - inhibitor induced <START:Disease> pain <END> syndrome ( <START:Disease> CIPS <END> ) : a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation .
Bone <START:Disease> pain <END> after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases .
Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the <START:Disease> pain <END> .
Nine patients with severe <START:Disease> pain <END> in their feet , which was registered after transplantation , were investigated .
Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones .
Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated <START:Disease> bone marrow oedema <END> in the painful bones .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> was not explained by other diseases causing foot <START:Disease> pain <END> , like <START:Disease> reflex sympathetic dystrophy <END> , <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> , <START:Disease> Morton ' s neuralgia <END> , <START:Disease> gout <END> , <START:Disease> osteoporosis <END> , <START:Disease> avascular necrosis <END> , <START:Disease> intermittent claudication <END> , orthopaedic <START:Disease> foot deformities <END> , <START:Disease> stress fractures <END> , and <START:Disease> hyperparathyroidism <END> .
The reduction of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> - or <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> trough levels and the administration of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers led to relief of <START:Disease> pain <END> .
The Calcineurin - inhibitor Induced <START:Disease> Pain <END> Syndrome ( <START:Disease> CIPS <END> ) is a rare but severe side effect of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> or <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation , magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans .
Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from <START:Disease> CIPS <END> .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> leukocytoclastic vasculitis <END> .
Skin reactions associated with oral <START:Chemical> coumarin <END> - derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence .
<START:Disease> Leukocytoclastic vasculitis <END> ( <START:Disease> LV <END> ) is primarily a <START:Disease> cutaneous small vessel vasculitis <END> , though systemic involvement may be encountered .
We report 4 patients with late - onset <START:Disease> LV <END> probably due to <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
All 4 patients presented with <START:Disease> skin eruptions <END> that developed after receiving <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> for several years .
The results of <START:Disease> skin lesion <END> biopsies were available in 3 patients , confirming <START:Disease> LV Cutaneous lesions <END> resolved in all patients after <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> was discontinued .
In 2 of the 4 patients , rechallenge with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> led to recurrence of the lesions .
<START:Disease> LV <END> may be a late - onset adverse reaction associated with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> therapy .
Effects of an inhibitor of <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> converting enzyme ( <START:Chemical> Captopril <END> ) on <START:Disease> pulmonary and renal insufficiency <END> due to <START:Disease> intravascular coagulation <END> in the rat .
Induction of <START:Disease> intravascular coagulation <END> and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and <START:Chemical> tranexamic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> AMCA <END> ) in the rat gives rise to <START:Disease> pulmonary and renal insufficiency <END> resembling that occurring after <START:Disease> trauma <END> or <START:Disease> sepsis <END> in man .
Injection of <START:Chemical> Captopril <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both <START:Disease> pulmonary and renal insufficiency <END> in this rat model .
The lung weights were lower and PaO 2 was improved in rats given this enzyme - blocking agent .
The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that <START:Chemical> Captopril <END> did not influence the extravasation of protein .
<START:Disease> Renal damage <END> as reflected by an increase in serum <START:Chemical> urea <END> and in kidney weight was prevented by <START:Chemical> Captopril <END> .
The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and <START:Chemical> AMCA <END> alone .
It is suggested that the effects of <START:Chemical> Captopril <END> on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of <START:Chemical> Angiotension II <END> and an increase in <START:Chemical> prostacyclin <END> ( secondary to an increase in <START:Chemical> bradykinin <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Captopril <END> may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less <START:Disease> kidney damage <END> will be produced .
Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of <START:Disease> birth defects <END> : National <START:Disease> Birth Defects <END> Prevention Study .
OBJECTIVE : To estimate the association between antibacterial medications and selected <START:Disease> birth defects <END> .
DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Population - based , multisite , case - control study of women who had pregnancies affected by 1 of more than 30 eligible major <START:Disease> birth defects <END> identified via <START:Disease> birth defect <END> surveillance programs in 10 states ( n = 13 155 ) and control women randomly selected from the same geographical regions ( n = 4941 ) .
MAIN EXPOSURE : Reported maternal use of antibacterials ( 1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester ) .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE : Odds ratios ( ORs ) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected <START:Disease> birth defects <END> adjusted for potential confounders .
RESULTS : The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy , peaking during the third month .
<START:Chemical> Sulfonamides <END> were associated with <START:Disease> anencephaly <END> ( adjusted OR [ AOR ] = 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 3 - 8 . 8 ) , <START:Disease> hypoplastic left heart syndrome <END> ( AOR = 3 . 2 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 7 . 6 ) , <START:Disease> coarctation of the aorta <END> ( AOR = 2 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 3 - 5 . 6 ) , <START:Disease> choanal atresia <END> ( AOR = 8 . 0 ; 95 % CI , 2 . 7 - 23 . 5 ) , <START:Disease> transverse limb deficiency <END> ( AOR = 2 . 5 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 0 - 5 . 9 ) , and <START:Disease> diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( AOR = 2 . 4 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 5 . 4 ) .
<START:Chemical> Nitrofurantoins <END> were associated with <START:Disease> anophthalmia <END> or <START:Disease> microphthalmos <END> ( AOR = 3 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 12 . 2 ) , <START:Disease> hypoplastic left heart syndrome <END> ( AOR = 4 . 2 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 9 - 9 . 1 ) , <START:Disease> atrial septal defects <END> ( AOR = 1 . 9 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 3 . 4 ) , and <START:Disease> cleft lip <END> with <START:Disease> cleft palate <END> ( AOR = 2 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 2 - 3 . 9 ) .
Other antibacterial agents that showed associations included <START:Chemical> erythromycins <END> ( 2 defects ) , <START:Chemical> penicillins <END> ( 1 defect ) , <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> ( 1 defect ) , and <START:Chemical> quinolones <END> ( 1 defect ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Reassuringly , <START:Chemical> penicillins <END> , <START:Chemical> erythromycins <END> , and <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> , although used commonly by pregnant women , were not associated with many <START:Disease> birth defects <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sulfonamides <END> and <START:Chemical> nitrofurantoins <END> were associated with several <START:Disease> birth defects <END> , indicating a need for additional scrutiny .
Time course alterations of QTC interval due to <START:Chemical> hypaque 76 <END> .
Sequential measurement of QT interval during left ventricular angiography was made 30 seconds and one , three , five and ten minutes after injection of <START:Chemical> hypaque 76 <END> .
The subjects were ten patients found to have normal left ventricles and coronary arteries .
Significant <START:Disease> QTC prolongation <END> occurred in 30 seconds to one minute in association with marked <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and elevation of cardiac output .
<START:Disease> Endometrial carcinoma <END> after <START:Disease> Hodgkin disease <END> in childhood .
A 34 - year - old patient developed metastic <START:Disease> endometrial carcinoma <END> after <START:Disease> Hodgkin disease <END> in childhood .
She had <START:Disease> ovarian failure <END> after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for <START:Disease> Hodgkin disease <END> , and received exogenous <START:Chemical> estrogens <END> , a treatment implicated in the development of <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> in menopausal women .
Young women on replacement <START:Chemical> estrogens <END> for <START:Disease> ovarian failure <END> after <START:Disease> cancer <END> therapy may also have increased risk of <START:Disease> endometrial carcinoma <END> and should be examined periodically .
Antipsychotic - like profile of <START:Chemical> thioperamide <END> , a selective H 3 - receptor antagonist in mice .
Experimental and clinical evidence points to a role of central histaminergic system in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
The present study was designed to study the effect of <START:Chemical> histamine <END> H ( 3 ) - receptor ligands on neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced climbing behavior and <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced locomotor activities in mice .
<START:Disease> Catalepsy <END> was induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 2 mg / kg p . o . ) , while <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg s . c . ) and <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> ( 2 mg / kg s . c . ) were used for studying climbing behavior and locomotor activities , respectively .
<START:Chemical> ( R ) - alpha - methylhistamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> RAMH <END> ) ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) and <START:Chemical> thioperamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> THP <END> ) ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) , per se did not cause <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
Administration of <START:Chemical> THP <END> ( 3 . 75 , 7 . 5 and 15 mg / kg i . p . ) 1 h prior to <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> resulted in a dose - dependent increase in the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> times ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
However , pretreatment with <START:Chemical> RAMH <END> significantly reversed such an effect of <START:Chemical> THP <END> ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) .
<START:Chemical> RAMH <END> per se showed significant reduction in locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed but <START:Chemical> THP <END> ( 15 mg / kg i . p . ) per se had no effect on these parameters .
On <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> , <START:Chemical> THP <END> ( 3 . 75 and 7 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) reduced locomotor time , distance traveled and average speed ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> RAMH <END> ( 5 microg i . c . v . ) could partially reverse such effects of <START:Chemical> THP <END> ( 3 . 75 mg / kg i . p . ) .
Climbing behavior induced by <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> was reduced in animals treated with <START:Chemical> THP <END> .
Such an effect was , however , reversed in presence of <START:Chemical> RAMH <END> .
<START:Chemical> THP <END> exhibited an antipsychotic - like profile by potentiating <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , reducing <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> and reducing <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced climbing in mice .
Such effects of <START:Chemical> THP <END> were reversed by <START:Chemical> RAMH <END> indicating the involvement of <START:Chemical> histamine <END> H ( 3 ) - receptors .
Findings suggest a potential for H ( 3 ) - receptor antagonists in improving the refractory cases of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
High - dose <START:Chemical> tranexamic Acid <END> is associated with nonischemic clinical <START:Disease> seizures <END> in cardiac surgical patients .
BACKGROUND : In 2 separate centers , we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative <START:Disease> convulsive <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> from 1 . 3 % to 3 . 8 % in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures .
These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high - dose <START:Chemical> tranexamic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> TXA <END> ) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage .
The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between <START:Chemical> TXA <END> usage and <START:Disease> seizures <END> after cardiac surgery .
METHODS : An in - depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients , and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies .
RESULTS : Twenty - one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new <START:Disease> cerebral ischemic injury <END> , but <START:Disease> seizures <END> were likely due to <START:Disease> ischemic brain injury <END> in 3 patients .
All patients with <START:Disease> seizures <END> did not have permanent <START:Disease> neurological abnormalities <END> .
All 24 patients with <START:Disease> seizures <END> received high doses of <START:Chemical> TXA <END> intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg / kg , had a mean age of 69 . 9 years , and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures .
All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass .
No evidence of <START:Disease> brain ischemic <END> , metabolic , or <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> - induced causes for their <START:Disease> seizures <END> was apparent .
CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that use of high - dose <START:Chemical> TXA <END> in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open - chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical <START:Disease> seizures <END> in susceptible patients .
Neutrophil <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production in patients with <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
Defects in <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production may be implicated in the high incidence of <START:Disease> bacterial infections <END> in patients with <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> ( <START:Disease> ALF <END> ) .
In the present study , <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> radical production in patients with <START:Disease> ALF <END> due to <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> was compared with that of healthy volunteers .
Neutrophils from 14 <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with <START:Disease> ALF <END> or control serum .
<START:Chemical> Superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production by <START:Disease> ALF <END> neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with <START:Disease> ALF <END> serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production in neutrophils stimulated with <START:Chemical> formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine <END> ( <START:Chemical> fMLP <END> ) from a further 18 <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils .
Serum C 3 complement levels were significantly reduced in <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients compared with control subjects ( P < 0 . 0005 ) .
These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in <START:Disease> ALF <END> due to <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement , possibly connected to the complement receptor .
A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB .
The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) and / or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound .
A Tween 80 - coated <START:Chemical> poly - L - lactid acid <END> nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system , able to trespass the BBB .
<START:Chemical> Tacrine <END> , administered in <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> pre - treated rats , induces electrocorticographic <START:Disease> seizures <END> and delayed <START:Disease> hippocampal damage <END> .
The toxic effects of <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - loaded <START:Chemical> poly - L - lactid acid <END> nanoparticles ( 5 mg / kg ) , a saline solution of <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i . p . administration in <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> - pre - treated Wistar rats .
All the animals treated with <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms , i . e . <START:Disease> epileptic <END> onset , with respect to those animals treated with the free compound ( 10 min vs . 22 min respectively ) .
In addition , <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - loaded nanoparticles administration induced <START:Disease> damage of neuronal cells <END> in CA 1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals , while the saline solution of <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> only in 60 % of animals .
Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control ( saline - treated ) group of animals .
In conclusion , the evaluation of time - to - onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - <START:Chemical> lithium <END> model of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> in the rat , could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass ( or not ) the BBB in vivo .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> nystagmus <END> correlates with midpontine activation .
The pathomechanism of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> nystagmus <END> ( <START:Disease> NIN <END> ) is unknown .
The aim of this study was to delineate brain structures that are involved in <START:Disease> NIN <END> generation .
Eight healthy volunteers inhaled <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> in darkness during a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) experiment ; eye movements were registered using video - oculography .
<START:Disease> NIN <END> correlated with blood <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> level - dependent ( BOLD ) activity levels in a midpontine site in the posterior basis pontis .
<START:Disease> NIN <END> - induced midpontine activation may correspond to activation of the dorsomedial pontine nuclei and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis , structures known to participate in the generation of multidirectional saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements .
National project on the prevention of mother - to - infant <START:Disease> infection by hepatitis B virus <END> in Japan .
In Japan , a nationwide prevention program against mother - to - infant <START:Disease> infection by hepatitis B virus <END> ( HBV ) started in 1985 .
This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> ) and <START:Chemical> hepatitis B e antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> ) positive mothers .
These infants are treated with two injections of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin ( HBIG ) and at least three injections of plasma derived <START:Chemical> hepatitis B vaccine <END> .
We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987 .
93 . 4 % pregnant women had the chance to be examined for <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> , and the positive rate was 1 . 4 to 1 . 5 % .
The <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> positive rate in <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> positive was 23 to 26 % .
The <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3 % and 2 % respectively .
Some problems may arise , because 27 to 30 % of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas .
Chronic <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> treatment in the rat : efficacy , <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , and effect on plasma and tissue <START:Chemical> folate <END> concentrations .
<START:Chemical> Folate <END> depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug ( AED ) therapy .
<START:Chemical> Carbamazepine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> ) , a commonly used AED , has been implicated in some clinical studies .
A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> treatment on <START:Chemical> folate <END> concentrations in the rat .
In the course of developing this model , a common vehicle , <START:Chemical> propylene glycol <END> , by itself in high doses , was found to exhibit protective properties against induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and inhibited <START:Disease> weight gain <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> induced by <START:Chemical> hexafluorodiethyl ether <END> ( <START:Chemical> HFDE <END> ) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> than <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by maximal electroshock ( MES ) .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg / kg was continuously protective against <START:Chemical> HFDE <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and was minimally toxic as measured by <START:Disease> weight gain <END> over 8 weeks of treatment .
The <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals , however , were below those normally considered protective .
This treatment with <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> had no apparent adverse effect on <START:Chemical> folate <END> concentrations in the rat , and , indeed , the <START:Chemical> folate <END> concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment .
Regional localization of the antagonism of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> by intracerebral <START:Chemical> calcitonin <END> injections .
<START:Chemical> Calcitonin <END> receptors are found in the brain , and intracerebral infusions of <START:Chemical> calcitonin <END> can produce behavioral effects .
Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced locomotor activity .
In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of <START:Chemical> calcitonin <END> into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens .
In the present experiment <START:Chemical> calcitonin <END> decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake .
The areas where <START:Chemical> calcitonin <END> is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens , suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of <START:Chemical> calcitonin <END> in inhibiting <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced locomotor activity .
Estrogen prevents <START:Chemical> cholesteryl ester <END> accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> .
Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> .
Many patients , however , develop negative long - term side effects such as <START:Disease> premature atherosclerosis <END> .
We have previously demonstrated that <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> treatment increases <START:Disease> atherosclerotic lesion <END> formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice .
Furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> - treated females had less <START:Chemical> cholesteryl ester <END> accumulation .
In the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> .
We have utilized the human monocyte cell line , THP - 1 as a model to address this question .
Briefly , cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage - like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM <START:Chemical> 17 beta - estradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> ) , 100 nM <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> or vehicle ( 0 . 01 % <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> ) .
Cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h .
Cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or total RNA was isolated .
<START:Chemical> E 2 <END> decreased the accumulation of <START:Chemical> cholesteryl esters <END> in macrophages following <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> treatment .
<START:Chemical> Ritonavir <END> increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , CD 36 mRNA , responsible for the uptake of LDL .
Additionally , <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD 36 mRNA expression .
Treatment with <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> , however , failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level .
<START:Chemical> E 2 <END> did , however , significantly suppress CD 36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry .
This data suggests that <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> modifies the expression of CD 36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced <START:Chemical> cholesteryl ester <END> accumulation following <START:Chemical> ritonavir <END> treatment .
<START:Chemical> Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate <END> protects the piriform cortex in the <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> model .
<START:Chemical> Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> ) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa - beta .
Both , production of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species as well as activation of NF - kappaB have been implicated in severe <START:Disease> neuronal damage <END> in different sub - regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortices .
The effect of <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> on <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> - associated cell loss in the hippocampus and piriform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> model .
Treatment with 150 mg / kg <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> before and following <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> significantly increased the mortality rate to 100 % .
Administration of 50 mg / kg <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> ( low - dose ) did not exert major effects on the development of a <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> or the mortality rate .
In vehicle - treated rats , <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> caused pronounced <START:Disease> neuronal damage <END> in the piriform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and interneurons .
Low - dose <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the piriform cortex .
A significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in vehicle - and <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> - treated rats following <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> .
In conclusion , the NF - kappaB inhibitor and antioxidant <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> protected the piriform cortex , whereas it did not affect hilar <START:Disease> neuronal loss <END> .
These data might indicate that the generation of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species and activation of NF - kappaB plays a more central role in <START:Disease> seizure <END> - associated <START:Disease> neuronal damage <END> in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hilus .
However , future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which <START:Chemical> PDTC <END> exerted its beneficial effects in the piriform cortex .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> <START:Disease> pulmonary toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side - effects , the most problematic being <START:Disease> pneumonitis <END> .
The <START:Disease> pulmonary toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell - mediated <START:Disease> hypersensitivity pneumonitis <END> .
The clinical and radiographic features of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> - induced <START:Disease> pulmonary toxicity <END> are characteristic but nonspecific .
The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities , such as <START:Disease> heart failure <END> , <START:Disease> infection <END> , and <START:Disease> malignancy <END> .
While withdrawal of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases , this is not always possible or advisable .
Dose reduction or concomitant <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy may have a role in selected patients .
Effect of <START:Chemical> green tea <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> combination in <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of <START:Chemical> green tea <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> on heart weight , body weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation , endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> ( <START:Chemical> ISO <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
Adult male albino rats , treated with <START:Chemical> ISO <END> ( 200 mg / kg , s . c . ) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) elevation of heart weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation and <START:Chemical> Ca <END> + 2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in body weight , endogenous antioxidants , <START:Chemical> Na <END> + / <START:Chemical> K <END> + ATPase and <START:Chemical> Mg <END> + 2 ATPase levels .
Administration of <START:Chemical> green tea <END> ( 100 mg / kg / day , p . o . ) and <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> ( 100 mg / kg / day , p . o . ) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with <START:Chemical> ISO <END> on the day 29 th and 30 th , showed a significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) decrease in heart weight , serum marker enzymes , lipid peroxidation , <START:Chemical> Ca <END> + 2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight , endogenous antioxidants , <START:Chemical> Na <END> + / <START:Chemical> K <END> + ATPase and <START:Chemical> Mg <END> + 2 ATPase when compared with <START:Chemical> ISO <END> treated group and <START:Chemical> green tea <END> or <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> alone treated groups .
These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of <START:Chemical> green tea <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> during <START:Chemical> ISO <END> induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
Treatment of <START:Disease> tinnitus <END> by intratympanic instillation of <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> ( <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ) 2 per cent through ventilation tubes .
<START:Disease> Idiopathic subjective tinnitus <END> ( <START:Disease> IST <END> ) is one of the most obscure otological pathologies .
This paper presents the results of treating <START:Disease> IST <END> by intratympanic instillation of <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> ( <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ) 2 per cent through a grommet , for five weekly courses .
Fifty - two patients suffering from intractable <START:Disease> tinnitus <END> entered this therapeutic trial , but only nine finished all five courses .
In one patient , the <START:Disease> tinnitus <END> was almost completely abolished , but in all the nine patients the decompensated <START:Disease> tinnitus <END> changed to a compensated one .
We suggest this mode of treatment for patients that were previously treated by drugs , acupuncture and biofeedback , with disappointing results .
Patients should be warned about the side effects of <START:Disease> vertigo <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , which subsides gradually with every new instillation , and that the <START:Disease> tinnitus <END> may not disappear but will be alleviated , enabling them to cope more easily with the disease and lead a more normal life .
<START:Disease> Tetany <END> and <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> due to surreptitious <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> -- importance of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> supplementation .
Diuretics may induce <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> , <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> and <START:Disease> hypomagnesemia <END> .
While severe <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> may cause <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> , severe <START:Disease> hypomagnesemia <END> is associated with <START:Disease> muscle spasms <END> and <START:Disease> tetany <END> which cannot be corrected by <START:Chemical> potassium <END> and <START:Chemical> calcium <END> supplementation alone ( 1 , 2 ) .
Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described , mainly in women who are concerned that they are <START:Disease> obese <END> or <START:Disease> edematous <END> .
Symptomatic <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> has been reported in such patients ( 3 - 7 ) and in one case <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> was observed ( 8 ) , but the effects of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> depletion were not noted in these patients .
Management strategies for <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> hepatitis C <END> : clinical and economic implications .
OBJECTIVES : Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost - effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha - 2 b / <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> compared with <START:Chemical> interferon - alpha <END> monotherapy in the treatment of <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> ( <START:Disease> CHC <END> ) .
Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect : <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> ( <START:Disease> RIHA <END> ) .
The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> during treatment of <START:Disease> CHC <END> in a clinical trial setting .
METHODS : A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> .
Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating <START:Disease> RIHA <END> .
Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> RIHA <END> , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with combination therapy .
The standard of care for management of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> is reduction or discontinuation of the <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> dosage .
We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant <START:Disease> RIHA <END> to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692 ) .
The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317 .
In comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16 , 459 .
CONCLUSIONS : The direct cost of treating clinically significant <START:Disease> RIHA <END> is 1 % ( 170 / 16 , 459 ) of drug treatment costs .
Questions remain about the optimal dose of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> and the incidence of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> in a real - world population .
Despite these uncertainties , this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating <START:Disease> RIHA <END> provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect .
<START:Disease> Cardiac toxicity <END> observed in association with high - dose <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - based chemotherapy for metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
INTRODUCTION : <START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens .
In high doses , its nonhematological dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicity <END> is <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
STUDY DESIGN : We combined <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> , <START:Chemical> melphalan <END> and high - dose <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> , <START:Chemical> thiotepa <END> , and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> in a triple sequential high - dose regimen for patients with metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy - responsive metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> receiving 96 - h infusional <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> as part of a triple sequential high - dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) and the following pretreatment characteristics : presence of electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormalities , age , <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , prior cardiac history , smoking , <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> , prior use of <START:Chemical> anthracyclines <END> , and left - sided chest irradiation .
RESULTS : Six of 61 women ( 10 % ) developed clinically reversible grade 3 <START:Disease> CHF <END> following infusional <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31 % .
Incidence of transient <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - related <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> ( 10 % ) is comparable to previous recorded literature .
Older age was significantly correlated with the <START:Disease> CHF <END> development ; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing <START:Disease> CHF <END> of 45 and 59 , respectively .
No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics .
CONCLUSIONS : As a result of these findings , oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients .
Routine EKG monitoring during infusional <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> did not predict <START:Disease> CHF <END> development .
<START:Chemical> Octreotide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypoxemia <END> and <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension <END> in premature neonates .
The authors report 2 cases of premature neonates who had enterocutaneous <START:Disease> fistula <END> complicating <START:Disease> necrotizing enterocolitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Pulmonary hypertension <END> developed after administration of a somatostatin analogue , <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> , to enhance resolution of the <START:Disease> fistula <END> .
The authors discuss the mechanism of the occurrence of this complication and recommend caution of its use in high - risk premature neonates .
Anti - <START:Disease> carcinogenic <END> action of <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> given simultaneously with <START:Chemical> diethylnitrosamine <END> in the rat .
The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> ( <START:Chemical> PB <END> : 15 mg per rat of ingested dose ) on <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> when it is administered simultaneously with <START:Chemical> diethylnitrosamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DEN <END> : 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Wistar rats ( 180 g ) were treated by <START:Chemical> DEN <END> alone or by <START:Chemical> DEN <END> + <START:Chemical> PB <END> during 2 , 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for <START:Disease> hepatocarcinogenesis <END> .
After the end of the treatment , the number and the size of induced PAS positive <START:Disease> preneoplastic foci <END> was significantly reduced when <START:Chemical> PB <END> was given simultaneously with <START:Chemical> DEN <END> for 4 and 6 weeks .
The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in <START:Chemical> DEN <END> treated rats were also significantly decreased in <START:Chemical> DEN <END> + <START:Chemical> PB <END> treated rats .
When the treatment last only 2 weeks , the presence of <START:Chemical> PB <END> did not change significantly the last parameters .
In <START:Chemical> DEN <END> + <START:Chemical> PB <END> treated rats , the survival was prolonged and the <START:Disease> tumor <END> incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by <START:Chemical> DEN <END> alone .
It is concluded that <START:Chemical> PB <END> , which promotes <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> when administered after the <START:Chemical> DEN <END> treatment , reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with <START:Chemical> DEN <END> .
This ' anti - carcinogen ' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the <START:Disease> precancerous lesions <END> .
Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this ' paradoxical ' <START:Chemical> PB <END> effect .
Induction of the <START:Disease> obstructive sleep apnea syndrome <END> in a woman by exogenous <START:Chemical> androgen <END> administration .
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54 - yr - old woman who had developed physical changes and the <START:Disease> syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea <END> while being administered exogenous <START:Chemical> androgens <END> .
When the <START:Chemical> androgens <END> were withdrawn , the patient ' s physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal .
A rechallenge with <START:Chemical> androgen <END> produced symptoms of <START:Disease> obstructive sleep apnea <END> that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone .
Previous reports have favored a role of <START:Chemical> androgens <END> in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> sleep apnea <END> .
Our report provides direct evidence for this role .
Structural and functional measurements indicate that <START:Chemical> androgens <END> exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep .
Development of the <START:Disease> obstructive sleep apnea syndrome <END> must be considered a possible side effect of <START:Chemical> androgen <END> therapy .
A randomized comparison of <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> and <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> for induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
In a randomized study , <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> were compared in 20 patients ( 10 in each group ) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures .
Each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug - induced <START:Disease> reductions in mean arterial blood pressure <END> ( BP ) ( 50 to 55 mmHg ) .
Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant ( p less than 0 . 05 ) <START:Disease> increase in heart rate and cardiac output <END> ; rebound <START:Disease> hypertension <END> was observed in three patients after discontinuation of <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> .
<START:Chemical> Labetalol <END> administration was not associated with any of these findings .
Arterial <START:Chemical> PO 2 <END> decreased in both groups .
It was concluded that <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> offers advantages over <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> .
The risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> in women prescribed <START:Chemical> cyproterone acetate <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> : a nested cohort analysis and case - control study .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Cyproterone acetate <END> combined with <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> ) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with <START:Disease> acne <END> and <START:Disease> hirsutism <END> and is also a treatment option for <START:Disease> polycystic ovary syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> PCOS <END> ) .
Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> ( <START:Disease> VTE <END> ) associated with <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> compared with conventional combined <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> ( COCs ) .
We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding .
METHODS : Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case - control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with <START:Disease> acne <END> , <START:Disease> hirsutism <END> or <START:Disease> PCOS <END> to estimate the risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> associated with <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
RESULTS : The age - adjusted incidence rate ratio for <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> versus conventional COCs was 2 . 20 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 1 . 35 - 3 . 58 ] .
Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception , had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms , the case - control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio ( OR ( adj )) of 7 . 44 ( 95 % CI 3 . 67 - 15 . 08 ) for <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> use compared with an OR ( adj ) of 2 . 58 ( 95 % CI 1 . 60 - 4 . 18 ) for use of conventional COCs .
CONCLUSIONS : We have demonstrated an increased risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> in women with <START:Disease> acne <END> , <START:Disease> hirsutism <END> or <START:Disease> PCOS <END> although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded .
Adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with <START:Chemical> cis - platin <END> and <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> .
Survival for patients with advanced <START:Disease> head and neck carcinoma <END> and <START:Disease> esophageal carcinoma <END> is poor with radiotherapy and / or surgery .
Obviously , there is a need for effective chemotherapy .
In the present study , <START:Chemical> cis - platin <END> ( 80 - 120 mg / m 2 BSA ) and <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ( 1000 mg / m 2 BSA daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days ) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surgery .
The aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treatment .
Before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ECG recordings were performed .
In the pre - treatment evaluation , signs of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> were found in 33 patients ( 43 % ) .
During treatment , adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients ( 18 % ) .
The mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group , 64 years .
The incidence of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> was not higher in patients with signs of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> than in those without in the pre - treatment evaluation .
The most common signs of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> were <START:Disease> chest pain <END> , ST - T wave changes and <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> .
This was followed by <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> in one patient and <START:Disease> sudden death <END> in another .
It is concluded that patients on <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if <START:Disease> chest pain <END> or <START:Disease> tachyarrhythmia <END> is observed .
Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
A prospective , randomized , double - blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) refractory to medical treatment was designed .
Ten consecutive patients ( mean age , 58 . 4 + / - 6 . 8 years ; 7 men , 3 women ) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease ( mean disease time , 8 . 4 + / - 3 . 5 years ) , disabling motor fluctuations ( Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3 - 5 in off - drug phases ) and <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> were selected .
All patients had bilateral symptoms and their <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> equivalent dosing were analysed .
Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna ( GPi ) and four in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) .
Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s Disease <END> Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Hoehn _ Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living ( ADL ) score in ' on ' - and ' off ' - drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery .
There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group .
Changes in UPDRS , Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups .
Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups .
Complications were observed in two patients : one had a left <START:Disease> homonymous hemianopsia <END> after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with <START:Chemical> Valproate <END> 1000 mg / day .
The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced <START:Disease> PD <END> refractory to medical treatment .
Bladder <START:Disease> retention of urine <END> as a result of continuous intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> : 2 case reports .
Sedation has been commonly used in the neonate to decrease the stress and <START:Disease> pain <END> from the noxious stimuli and invasive procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit , as well as to facilitate synchrony between ventilator and spontaneous breaths .
<START:Chemical> Fentanyl <END> , an opioid analgesic , is frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit setting for these very purposes .
Various reported side effects of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> administration include <START:Disease> chest wall rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> respiratory depression <END> , and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
Here , 2 cases of <START:Disease> urinary bladder retention <END> leading to renal pelvocalyceal dilatation mimicking <START:Disease> hydronephrosis <END> as a result of continuous infusion of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> are reported .
<START:Chemical> Yohimbine <END> treatment of <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> induced by <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers .
BACKGROUND : Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of <START:Disease> male impotence <END> .
A single case report suggests that <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> may be used to treat the <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> of <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> .
This study evaluated <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> as a treatment for the <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> caused by <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers .
METHOD : Six patients with either <START:Disease> obsessive compulsive disorder <END> , <START:Disease> trichotillomania <END> , <START:Disease> anxiety <END> , or <START:Disease> affective disorders <END> who suffered <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers were given <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> on a p . r . n .
basis in an open clinical trial .
Various doses of <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient .
RESULTS : Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> .
One patient who failed to comply with <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> treatment had no therapeutic effects .
Side effects of <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> included excessive sweating , increased <START:Disease> anxiety <END> , and a wound - up feeling in some patients .
CONCLUSION : The results of this study indicate that <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> may be an effective treatment for the <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> caused by <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers .
Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> for this indication .
Long - term follow - up of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> in children treated for <START:Disease> malignant mesenchymal tumors <END> : an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report .
The renal function of 74 children with <START:Disease> malignant mesenchymal tumors <END> in complete remission and who have received the same <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> chemotherapy protocol ( International Society of Pediatric Oncology <START:Disease> Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor <END> Study 84 [ SIOP MMT 84 ] ) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment .
Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g / m 2 of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> ( six or 10 cycles of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide , vincristine , and dactinomycin <END> [ <START:Chemical> IVA <END> ] ) .
None of them had received <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> chemotherapy .
Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years ; 58 patients were males and 42 females .
The most common primary <START:Disease> tumor <END> site was the head and neck .
Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes , <START:Disease> glucosuria <END> , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> aminoaciduria <END> , urinary pH , osmolarity , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance , <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> tubular reabsorption , beta 2 microglobulinuria , and lysozymuria .
Fifty - eight patients ( 78 % ) had normal renal tests , whereas 16 patients ( 22 % ) had <START:Disease> renal abnormalities <END> .
Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group : the first included four patients ( 5 % of the total population ) who developed major <START:Disease> toxicity <END> resulting in <START:Disease> Fanconi ' s syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> TDFS <END> ) ; and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> reabsorption .
The remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 microglobulinuria .
Severe <START:Disease> toxicity <END> was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g / m 2 of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> , a younger age ( less than 2 1 / 2 years old ) , and a predominance of vesicoprostatic <START:Disease> tumor <END> involvement .
This low percentage ( 5 % ) of TDFS must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> mesenchymal tumors <END> in children .
Why may <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> EACA <END> ) induce <START:Disease> myopathy <END> in man ?
Report of a case and literature review .
A case of <START:Disease> necrotizing myopathy <END> due to a short <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> EACA <END> ) treatment in a 72 year - old patient with <START:Disease> subarachnoid haemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> SAH <END> ) is described .
Pathogenetic hypotheses are discussed .
<START:Chemical> Valproate <END> - induced <START:Disease> chorea <END> and <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> in atypical <START:Disease> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> is a <START:Disease> disorder of amino acid metabolism <END> in which a defect in the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> cleavage system leads to an accumulation of <START:Chemical> glycine <END> in the brain and other body compartments .
In the classical form it presents as neonatal <START:Disease> apnea <END> , intractable <START:Disease> seizures <END> , and <START:Disease> hypotonia <END> , followed by significant <START:Disease> psychomotor retardation <END> .
An important subset of children with <START:Disease> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner .
This report describes a patient with mild <START:Disease> language delay <END> and <START:Disease> mental retardation <END> , who was found to have <START:Disease> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> following her presentation with acute <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> and <START:Disease> chorea <END> shortly after initiation of <START:Chemical> valproate <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> in high dose <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> chemotherapy .
<START:Chemical> Carboplatin <END> has been reported to cause <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> when administered in high doses to adult patients .
We report a 4 1 / 2 - year - old girl who was treated with high - dose <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> for metastatic parameningeal <START:Disease> embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function .
Possible contributing factors are discussed .
<START:Chemical> Spironolactone <END> : is it a novel drug for the prevention of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> - related <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> in <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients ?
OBJECTIVE : <START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> is the major adverse effect of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> ( <START:Chemical> AmB <END> ) , often limiting administration of full dosage .
Selective distal tubular epithelial <START:Disease> toxicity <END> seems to be responsible for the profound <START:Chemical> potassium <END> wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with <START:Chemical> AmB <END> .
<START:Chemical> Potassium <END> depletion also potentiates the tubular <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> AmB <END> .
This study was designed to assess the ability of <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> to reduce <START:Chemical> potassium <END> requirements and to prevent <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> in <START:Disease> neutropenic <END> patients on <START:Chemical> AmB <END> treatment .
METHODS : In this study 26 patients with various <START:Disease> hematological disorders <END> were randomized to receive either intravenous <START:Chemical> AmB <END> alone or <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and oral <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected <START:Disease> fungal infection <END> .
RESULTS : Patients receiving concomitant <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> had significantly higher plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels than those receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> alone ( P = 0 . 0027 ) .
Those patients receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> required significantly less <START:Chemical> potassium <END> supplementation to maintain their plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> within the normal range ( P = 0 . 022 ) .
Moreover , urinary <START:Chemical> potassium <END> losses were significantly less in patients receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> than those receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> alone ( P = 0 . 040 ) .
CONCLUSION : This study showed that <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> can reduce <START:Chemical> potassium <END> requirements and prevent <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> by reducing urinary <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss in <START:Disease> neutropenic <END> patients on <START:Chemical> AmB <END> treatment .
Patterns of <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> induced by <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> .
Twelve patients with <START:Disease> liver disease <END> related to <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> were seen between 1967 and 1977 .
Illness occurred within 1 -- 9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients , the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months , 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms .
<START:Disease> Jaundice <END> with tender <START:Disease> hepatomegaly <END> , usually preceded by symptoms of malaise , <START:Disease> anorexia <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , and associated with upper <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , was an invariable finding in all patients .
Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular <START:Disease> necrosis <END> and correlated with histopathological evidence of <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> , the spectrum of which ranged from <START:Disease> fatty change <END> and focal hepatocellular <START:Disease> necrosis <END> to <START:Disease> massive hepatic necrosis <END> .
Most patients showed moderate to severe <START:Disease> acute hepatitis <END> or <START:Disease> chronic active hepatitis <END> with associated <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> .
The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients , with rapid clinical improvement in 9 .
One patient died , having presented in <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> , and another , who had been taking <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> for 7 years , showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months .
The remaining patient in the series developed <START:Disease> fulminant hepatitis <END> when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
In this latter patient , and in 2 others , the causal relationship between <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> and <START:Disease> hepatic dysfunction <END> was proved with the recurrence of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> within 2 weeks of re - exposure to the drug .
<START:Disease> Hepatotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> in inflammatory <START:Disease> arthritis <END> : A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events .
BACKGROUND : Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) are handicapped by under - reporting and limited detail on individual cases .
We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of <START:Disease> liver failure <END> in two of our patients .
METHODS : Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years .
Patients ' , who had <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> on <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> and met a definition of a serious ADR , were identified .
Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument .
The likely frequency of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions .
RESULTS : Ten cases were identified : eight occurred during surveillance .
Eight patients were hospitalised , two in <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> - one died after a liver transplant .
All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment .
Seven patients had a <START:Disease> skin rash <END> , three <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> and one <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> .
Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent .
Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six .
Drug - related <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients .
The likely frequency of serious <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> was estimated at 0 . 4 % of treated patients .
CONCLUSION : Serious <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> appears to be under - appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .
Blood pressure response to chronic low - dose intrarenal <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> infusion in conscious rats .
<START:Chemical> Sodium chloride <END> solution ( 0 . 9 % ) or <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> in doses of 4 , 12 and 36 micrograms h - 1 kg - 1 was infused for five consecutive days , either intrarenally ( by a new technique ) or intravenously into rats with one kidney removed .
Intrarenal infusion of <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> caused <START:Disease> hypertension <END> at doses which did not do so when infused intravenously .
Intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> caused higher plasma <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> concentrations and a shift of the plasma <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> concentration - blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> levels .
These results suggest that <START:Disease> hypertension <END> after chronic intrarenal <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism .
Reduction in <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> by <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> .
A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over - the - counter analgesic containing <START:Chemical> sodium acetylsalicylate <END> , <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> , and <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> per mL of serum .
Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> on the CNS , attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( 52 micrograms / mL ) reduced the CNS <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> .
Studies in DBA / 2 J mice showed that : 1 ) pretreatment with <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( 100 mg / kg ) increased the interval between the administration of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( 300 to 450 mg / kg IP ) and the onset of fatal <START:Disease> convulsions <END> by a factor of about two ; and 2 ) pretreatment with <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( 75 mg / kg ) reduced the incidence of audiogenic <START:Disease> seizures <END> produced in the presence of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( 12 . 5 to 75 mg / kg IP ) .
The frequency of sound - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> after 12 . 5 or 25 mg / kg <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> was reduced from 50 to 5 % by <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> .
In the absence of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( up to 300 mg / kg ) did not modify the <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of <START:Chemical> pentylenetetrezol <END> in mice ( tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS ) .
<START:Chemical> Acetaminophen <END> ( up to 150 micrograms / mL ) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> into <START:Chemical> ATP <END> in slices of rat cerebral cortex .
Thus the mechanism by which <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> antagonizes the actions of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in the CNS remains unknown .
<START:Chemical> Bupropion <END> ( <START:Chemical> Zyban <END> ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Bupropion <END> is a monocyclic <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> structurally related to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Zyban <END> , a sustained - release formulation of <START:Chemical> bupropion hydrochloride <END> , was recently released in Ireland , as a smoking cessation aid .
In the initial 6 months since it ' s introduction , 12 <START:Disease> overdose <END> cases have been reported to The National Poisons Information Centre . 8 patients developed symptoms of <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Common features included <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> , drowsiness , <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> and <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Two patients developed severe <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> , including one patient who was resuscitated following a <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> .
All patients recovered without sequelae .
We report a case of a 31 year old female who required admission to the Intensive Care Unit for ventilation and full supportive therapy , following ingestion of 13 . 5 g <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> .
Recurrent <START:Disease> seizures <END> were treated with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> and broad complex <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> was successfully treated with <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Zyban <END> caused significant <START:Disease> neurological and cardiovascular toxicity <END> in <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The potential toxic effects should be considered when prescribing it as a smoking cessation aid .
Fear - potentiated <START:Disease> startle <END> , but not light - enhanced <START:Disease> startle <END> , is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs .
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES : The light - enhanced <START:Disease> startle <END> paradigm ( LES ) is suggested to model <START:Disease> anxiety <END> , because of the non - specific cue and the long - term effect .
In contrast , the fear - potentiated <START:Disease> startle <END> ( FPS ) is suggested to model conditioned fear .
However , the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar .
The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms .
METHODS : Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2 ) - adrenoceptor antagonist <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> ( 0 . 25 - 1 . 0 mg / kg ) , the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ( 2 C ) receptor agonist <START:Chemical> m - chlorophenylpiperazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> mCPP <END> , 0 . 5 - 2 . 0 mg / kg ) or the <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) inverse receptor agonist <START:Chemical> pentylenetetrazole <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> , 3 - 30 mg / kg ) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS .
RESULTS : None of the drugs enhanced LES , whereas <START:Chemical> mCPP <END> increased percentage FPS and <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> increased absolute FPS values .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> increased baseline <START:Disease> startle <END> amplitude in the LES , while <START:Chemical> mCPP <END> suppressed baseline <START:Disease> startle <END> in both the LES and FPS and <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> suppressed baseline <START:Disease> startle <END> in the FPS .
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm , none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response .
Thus , a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS .
Obsolete but dangerous antacid preparations .
One case of acute <START:Disease> hypercalcaemia <END> and two of recurrent <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of <START:Chemical> calcium carbon - ate <END> - <START:Chemical> sodium bicarbonate <END> powders for more than 20 years .
The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients ' medical practitioners .
It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient ' s problems , and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable .
Serial studies of <START:Disease> auditory neurotoxicity <END> in patients receiving <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Visual and auditory neurotoxicity <END> was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion - dependent <START:Disease> anemia <END> who were receiving <START:Chemical> iron <END> chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> .
Twenty - two patients in the affected group had <START:Disease> abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 Hz <END> and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels .
When <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed , audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks , and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic .
Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of <START:Disease> permanent disability <END> .
Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose , therapy was restarted with lower doses , usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of <START:Disease> auditory abnormality <END> , and with the exception of two cases no further <START:Disease> toxicity <END> was demonstrated .
Auditory deterioration and improvement , demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> , respectively , provided convincing evidence for a cause - and - effect relation between <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> administration and <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> .
Based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> .
A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities .
With mild <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks .
Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring .
In those with symptoms of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audiogram is stable or improved , therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose .
Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with <START:Disease> auditory dysfunction <END> .
Beta - 2 - adrenoceptor - mediated <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> and its abolishment by <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> .
The time course and concentration - effect relationship of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> was studied , using computer - aided pharmacokinetic - dynamic modeling .
Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> in antagonizing such <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> , together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs .
Six healthy subjects were given a 0 . 5 mg subcutaneous dose of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> on two occasions : 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> orally .
In the 7 - hour period after <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> administration , plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels and drug concentrations .
The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> concentrations and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> effects .
<START:Chemical> Oxprenolol <END> caused decreases of 65 % and 56 % of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> volume of distribution and clearance , respectively , and an increase of 130 % of its AUC .
In spite of higher <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> concentrations after <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> pretreatment , the <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2 - blocking action .
A phase II study of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in advanced metastatic <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and activity of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in patients with advanced metastatic <START:Disease> renal cell cancer <END> and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) 165 , with therapy .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : 29 patients were enrolled on a study of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> using an intra - patient dose escalation schedule .
Patients began <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> at 400 mg / d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg / d by day 54 .
Fifty - nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL - 2 and 52 % were performance status 2 or 3 .
Systemic plasma VEGF 165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients .
RESULTS : 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary <START:Disease> metastases <END> ( 4 % ) , one minor response , and 2 patients stable for over 6 months .
<START:Disease> Somnolence <END> and <START:Disease> constipation <END> were prominent <START:Disease> toxicities <END> and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg / day dose level .
Systemic plasma VEGF 165 levels did not change with therapy .
CONCLUSION : These results are consistent with a low level of activity of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
Administration of doses over 800 mg / day was difficult to achieve in this patient population , however lower doses were practical .
The dose - response relationship , if any , of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> for <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> is unclear .
Results of a comparative , phase III , 12 - week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double - blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed - dose combination of <START:Chemical> telmisartan <END> and <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> versus <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> monotherapy in Indian adults with stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed - dose combination ( FDC ) of <START:Chemical> telmisartan <END> 40 mg + <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> 5 mg ( T + A ) compared with <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> 5 - mg monotherapy ( A ) in adult Indian patients with stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
METHODS : This comparative , Phase III , 12 - week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double - blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks ; blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position .
Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP ) / diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie , patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg ) at end of study .
Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events , identified using physical examination , laboratory analysis , and electrocardiography .
RESULTS : A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study ; 203 patients ( 143 men , 60 women ) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group ) and considered with - drawn .
At study end , statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP ( T + A [ - 27 . 4 % ] ;
A [ - 16 . 6 % ] ) and DBP ( T + A [ - 20 . 1 % ] ;
A [ - 13 . 3 % ] ) ( all , P < 0 . 05 ) .
Response rates were 87 . 3 % ( 89 / 102 ) in the T + A group and 69 . 3 % ( 70 / 101 ) in the A group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups ( T + A , 16 . 0 % [ 17 / 106 ] ; A , 15 . 4 % [ 16 / 104 ] ) .
Peripheral <START:Disease> edema <END> was reported in 8 . 5 % patients ( 9 / 106 ) in the T + A group compared with 13 . 5 % ( 14 / 104 ) in the A group , and <START:Disease> cough <END> was reported in 3 . 8 % patients ( 4 / 106 ) in the T + A group and 1 . 0 % ( 1 / 104 ) patients in the A group ; these differences did not reach statistical significance .
The incidences of <START:Disease> headache <END> , <START:Disease> dizziness <END> , and <START:Disease> diarrhea <END> were similar between the 2 groups .
CONCLUSIONS : Among these Indian patients with stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , the FDC of T + A was found to be significantly more effective , with regard to BP reductions , than A , and both treatments were well tolerated .
Neonatal <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> responsive <START:Disease> convulsions <END> due to <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> therapy .
A 17 - day - old infant on <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> therapy 13 mg / kg daily from birth because of maternal <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> was admitted after 4 days of <START:Disease> clonic fits <END> .
No underlying infective or biochemical cause could be found .
The <START:Disease> fits <END> ceased within 4 hours of administering intramuscular <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> , suggesting an aetiology of <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> deficiency secondary to <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> medication .
Fatal <START:Disease> haemopericardium <END> and <START:Disease> gastrointestinal haemorrhage <END> due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
We report a case of fatal internal <START:Disease> haemorrhage <END> in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as <START:Chemical> flavonoids <END> , which are present in fruit juices , may increase the potency of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs , consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> in patients with <START:Disease> AIDS <END> on <START:Chemical> tenofovir <END> while receiving prolonged <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> course for <START:Disease> osteomyelitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Renal failure <END> developed after a prolonged course of <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> therapy in 2 patients who were receiving <START:Chemical> tenofovir disoproxil fumarate <END> as part of an antiretroviral regimen .
<START:Chemical> Tenofovir <END> has been implicated in the development of <START:Disease> Fanconi syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule .
<START:Chemical> Vancomycin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> agent .
Clinicians should be aware that <START:Chemical> tenofovir <END> may raise the risk of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> during prolonged administration of <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> .
<START:Disease> Myocardial infarction <END> in pregnancy associated with <START:Chemical> clomiphene citrate <END> for ovulation induction : a case report .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Clomiphene citrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> CC <END> ) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction .
It is considered safe , with minimal side effects .
<START:Disease> Thromboembolism <END> is a rare but life - threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
Spontaneous <START:Disease> coronary thrombosis <END> or <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:Disease> MI <END> ) during pregnancy , with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram .
CASE : A 33 - year - old woman with a 5 - week gestation had recently received <START:Chemical> CC <END> for ovulation induction and presented with <START:Disease> chest pain <END> .
An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9 . 10 ng / mL .
An initial exercise stress test was normal .
At the time of admission , the patient was at high risk of <START:Disease> radiation injury <END> to the fetus , so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester .
It showed normal coronary vessels .
CONCLUSION : This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between <START:Chemical> CC <END> and <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
<START:Disease> Thrombosis <END> might be a rare but hazardous complication of <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
Given this life - threatening complication , appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high - risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation .
Electrocardiographic changes and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> in patients receiving psychotropic drugs .
Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life - threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs , either <START:Chemical> phenothiazines <END> or tricyclic antidepressants .
Although most patients were receiving several drugs , <START:Chemical> Mellaril <END> ( <START:Chemical> thioridazine <END> ) appeared to be responsible for five cases of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> , one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman .
<START:Disease> Supraventricular tachycardia <END> developed in one patient receiving <START:Chemical> Thorazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> chlorpromazine <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Aventyl <END> ( <START:Chemical> nortriptyline <END> ) and <START:Chemical> Elavil <END> ( <START:Chemical> amitriptyline <END> ) each produced <START:Disease> left bundle branch block <END> in a 73 year old woman .
Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients .
The <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> responded to intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and to direct current electric shock ; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> combined with ventricular pacing in one .
The <START:Disease> tachyarrhythmias <END> generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped .
Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger ; only one clearly had antecedent <START:Disease> heart disease <END> .
Major <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> are a potential hazard in patients without <START:Disease> heart disease <END> who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs .
A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of <START:Disease> cardiac complications <END> to patients receiving <START:Chemical> phenothiazines <END> or tricyclic antidepressant drugs .
Electrocardiographic evidence of <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> in psychiatrically hospitalized <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> abusers .
The electrocardiograms ( ECG ) of 99 <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - abusing patients were compared with the ECGs of 50 <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> controls .
Eleven of the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> abusers and none of the controls had ECG evidence of significant <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> defined as <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> , <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , and <START:Disease> bundle branch block <END> .
Chronic effects of a novel synthetic <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> derivative ( <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> ) on normal heart and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in beagle dogs .
This study was designed to investigate the chronic <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> potential of <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> and a possible deteriorating effect of <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> on low - grade <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> pre - induced by <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> in beagle dogs .
In the chronic treatment , beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks , either a sublethal dose of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) .
The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing .
Animals which received over six courses of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> administration did not show any changes in ECG , blood pressure and histopathological examinations .
To examine a possibly deteriorating <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> , low - grade <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> was induced in dogs by four courses of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) .
Nine weeks after pre - treatment , dogs were given four courses of either <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) once every 3 weeks .
The low - grade <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> changes were enhanced by the additional <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> treatment .
On the contrary , the <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> treatment did not progress the grade of <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
In conclusion , <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> does not have any potential of chronic <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and deteriorating effect on <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> in dogs .
<START:Chemical> Debrisoquine <END> phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta - 2 receptor pharmacodynamics of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and its enantiomers .
The metabolism of the cardioselective beta - blocker <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> is under genetic control of the <START:Chemical> debrisoquine <END> / <START:Chemical> sparteine <END> type .
The two metabolic phenotypes , extensive ( EM ) and poor metabolizers ( PM ) , show different stereoselective metabolism , resulting in apparently higher beta - 1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> in EMs .
We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta - 2 adrenoceptor antagonism by <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
The drug effect studied was the antagonism by <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> .
By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and the active S - isomer , were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC 50 values , representing <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> plasma concentrations resulting in half - maximum receptor occupancy .
Six EMs received 0 . 5 mg of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> s . c . on two different occasions : 1 ) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2 ) 1 hr after 150 mg of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> p . o .
Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol , except for a higher <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> dose ( 0 . 75 mg ) on day 2 .
Blood samples for the analysis of plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> , <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> ( racemic , R - and S - isomer ) , and <START:Chemical> alpha - hydroxymetoprolol <END> concentrations were taken at regular time intervals , during 8 hr after <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
In PMs , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> increased the <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> area under the plasma concentration vs . time curve ( + 67 % ) .
Higher <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> / <START:Chemical> alpha - hydroxymetoprolol <END> ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R - / S - isomer ratios of unchanged drug .
There was a difference in <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> potency with higher racemic <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> IC 50 values in PMs ( 72 + / - 7 ng . ml - 1 ) than EMs ( 42 + / - 8 ng . ml - 1 , P less than . 001 ) . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Transient <START:Disease> hemiparesis <END> : a rare manifestation of <START:Chemical> diphenylhydantoin <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Report of two cases .
Among the common side effects of <START:Chemical> diphenylhydantoin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DPH <END> ) <START:Disease> overdose <END> , the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of <START:Disease> cerebellar dysfunction <END> .
Very rarely , the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin .
Two patients are presented who suffered progressive <START:Disease> hemiparesis <END> due to <START:Chemical> DPH <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
Both had brain surgery before <START:Chemical> DPH <END> treatment .
It is assumed that patients with some <START:Disease> cerebral damage <END> are liable to manifest <START:Chemical> DPH <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> as focal neurological signs .
Prenatal <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> programs <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> renal injury <END> in the rat .
Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development .
The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> programmed a progressive <START:Disease> increase in blood pressure <END> and <START:Disease> renal injury <END> in rats .
Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> ( 0 . 2 mg / kg body weight ) on gestational days 11 and 12 , 13 and 14 , 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , or 19 and 20 .
Offspring of rats administered <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20 % <START:Disease> reduction in glomerular number <END> compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age ( 22 527 + / - 509 versus 28 050 + / - 561 , P < 0 . 05 ) , which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age .
Six - to 9 - month old rats receiving prenatal <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17 % reduction in glomeruli ( 23 380 + / - 587 ) compared with control rats ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Male rats that received prenatal <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> on days 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , and 13 and 14 of gestation had <START:Disease> elevated blood pressures <END> at 6 months of age ; the latter group did not have a <START:Disease> reduction in glomerular number <END> .
Adult rats given <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> than control rats .
This study shows that prenatal <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> in rats results in a <START:Disease> reduction in glomerular number <END> , <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> , and <START:Disease> hypertension <END> when administered at specific points during gestation .
<START:Disease> Hypertension <END> was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a <START:Disease> reduction in glomerular number <END> , suggesting that a <START:Disease> reduction in glomerular number <END> is not the sole cause for the development of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Dynamic response of blood vessel in <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
In this study we postulated that during <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> induced by <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected , and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels .
The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered , but also dynamics of this response , was used in this paper .
Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals .
The beneficial effects of <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> administration to <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals are also confirmed through : lower level of blood <START:Chemical> urea <END> and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and higher level of <START:Chemical> potassium <END> .
The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals ( 8 . 07 + / - 1 . 7 s vs . 5 . 64 + / - 0 . 18 s ) .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values .
The pressure dynamic properties , quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic , confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals and beneficial effects of <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> administration .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> , and <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
Sixty - two patients with a <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> are reported .
Clinical manifestations of this disorder include <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> or , more frequently , <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> events in patients receiving <START:Chemical> heparin <END> .
Laboratory testing has revealed <START:Disease> a falling platelet count <END> , increased resistance to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , and aggregation of platelets by the patient ' s plasma when <START:Chemical> heparin <END> is added .
Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - dependent platelet membrane antibody .
The 20 deaths , 52 <START:Disease> hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications <END> , and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder .
Specific risk factors have not been identified ; therefore , all patients receiving <START:Chemical> heparin <END> should be monitored .
If the platelet count falls to less than 100 , 000 / mm 3 , while the patient is receiving <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> testing , using the patient ' s plasma , is indicated .
Management consists of cessation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , platelet anti - aggregating agents , and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated .
<START:Chemical> Curcumin <END> ameliorates <START:Disease> cognitive dysfunction <END> and oxidative damage in <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> administered rats .
The antiepileptic drugs , <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> are well known to cause <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> on chronic use .
The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> by antiepileptic drugs .
<START:Chemical> Curcumin <END> has shown antioxidant , anti - inflammatory and neuro - protective properties .
Therefore , the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic <START:Chemical> curcumin <END> administration on <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> - and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> and oxidative stress in rats .
Pharmacokinetic interactions of <START:Chemical> curcumin <END> with <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> were also studied .
Vehicle / drugs were administered daily for 21 days to male Wistar rats .
Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function .
At the end of study period , serum <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> , whole brain <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> and reduced <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> levels were estimated .
The administration of <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> for 21 days caused a significant <START:Disease> impairment of learning and memory <END> as well as an increased oxidative stress .
Concomitant <START:Chemical> curcumin <END> administration prevented the <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs .
<START:Chemical> Curcumin <END> co - administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> as well as <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> .
These results show that <START:Chemical> curcumin <END> has beneficial effect in mitigating the <START:Disease> deterioration of cognitive functions <END> and oxidative damage in rats treated with <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> without significantly altering their serum concentrations .
The findings suggest that <START:Chemical> curcumin <END> can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> and <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> therapy in preventing <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> associated with these drugs .
Effect of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> on gross behavioural changes produced by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> in cats .
The effect of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> injected into the cerebral ventricles of group - housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization ( rage , hissing and snarling ) , fighting ( attack with paws and claws , defense with paws and claws and biting ) , <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> , <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> clonic - tonic convulsions <END> produced by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> injected similarly was investigated .
<START:Chemical> Calcium chloride <END> depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> .
On the other hand , <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> , <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> clonic - tonic convulsions <END> evoked by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> were not significantly changed by <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> .
It is apparent that <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> can " dissociate " vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> , <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> clonic - tonic convulsions <END> caused by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Calcium chloride <END> inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites .
These results further support the view that <START:Chemical> calcium <END> ions in excess have an <START:Chemical> atropine <END> - like action also in the central nervous system .
<START:Disease> Cognitive deterioration <END> from long - term abuse of <START:Chemical> dextromethorphan <END> : a case report .
<START:Chemical> Dextromethorphan <END> ( <START:Chemical> DM <END> ) , the dextrorotatory isomer of <START:Chemical> 3 - hydroxy - N - methylmorphinan <END> , is the main ingredient in a number of widely available , over - the - counter antitussives .
Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968 ) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability .
Subsequently , however , several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature .
The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects , ranging from <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> restlessness <END> , <START:Disease> insomnia <END> , <START:Disease> ataxia <END> , slurred speech and <START:Disease> nystagmus <END> to mood changes , perceptual alterations , inattention , disorientation and <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> ( Rammer et al 1988 ; Katona and Watson 1986 ; Isbell and Fraser 1953 ; Devlin et al 1985 ; McCarthy 1971 ; Dodds and Revai 1967 ; Degkwitz 1964 ; Hildebrand et al 1989 ) .
There have also been two reported fatalities from <START:Chemical> DM <END> overdoses ( Fleming 1986 ) .
However , there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse .
This report describes a case of <START:Disease> cognitive deterioration <END> resulting from prolonged use of <START:Chemical> DM <END> .
<START:Disease> Ventricular tachyarrhythmias <END> during cesarean section after <START:Chemical> ritodrine <END> therapy : interaction with anesthetics .
This case illustrates that patients receiving <START:Chemical> ritodrine <END> for <START:Disease> preterm labor <END> may risk interactions between the residual betamimetic effects of <START:Chemical> ritodrine <END> and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean section .
Such interactions may result in serious <START:Disease> cardiovascular complications <END> even after cessation of an infusion of <START:Chemical> ritodrine <END> .
Preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> level .
Delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possible .
Careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> are advised .
After delivery of the infant , there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha - adrenergic vasopressor such as <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> to treat <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> patients with <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> .
The selective 5 - HT 6 receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> Ro 4368554 <END> restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of <START:Disease> memory deficiency <END> in the rat .
Antagonists at <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> type 6 ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ( 6 )) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory .
Although the underlying mechanism ( s ) are not well understood , these effects may involve an increase in <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ACh <END> ) levels .
The present study sought to characterize the cognitive - enhancing effects of the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ( 6 ) antagonist <START:Chemical> Ro 4368554 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 - benzenesulfonyl - 7 - ( 4 - methyl - piperazin - 1 - yl ) 1 H - indole <END> ) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic ( <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> pretreatment ) and a serotonergic - ( <START:Chemical> tryptophan <END> ( <START:Chemical> TRP <END> ) depletion ) deficient model , and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor <START:Chemical> metrifonate <END> .
Initial testing in a time - dependent forgetting task employing a 24 - h delay between training and testing showed that <START:Chemical> metrifonate <END> improved object recognition ( at 10 and 30 mg / kg , p . o . ) , whereas <START:Chemical> Ro 4368554 <END> was inactive .
Both , <START:Chemical> Ro 4368554 <END> ( 3 and 10 mg / kg , intraperitoneally ( i . p . )) and <START:Chemical> metrifonate <END> ( 10 mg / kg , p . o . , respectively ) reversed <START:Disease> memory deficits <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> and <START:Chemical> TRP <END> depletion ( 10 mg / kg , i . p . , and 3 mg / kg , p . o . , respectively ) .
In conclusion , although <START:Chemical> Ro 4368554 <END> did not improve a time - related retention deficit , it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic <START:Disease> memory deficit <END> , suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by <START:Chemical> Ro 4368554 <END> and , possibly , other <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ( 6 ) receptor antagonists .
<START:Chemical> Estradiol <END> reduces <START:Disease> seizure <END> - induced <START:Disease> hippocampal injury <END> in ovariectomized female but not in male rats .
Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from <START:Disease> hippocampal injury <END> induced by <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( <START:Disease> SE <END> ) .
We compared the effects of <START:Chemical> 17 beta - estradiol <END> in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> SE <END> .
Rats received subcutaneous injections of <START:Chemical> 17 beta - estradiol <END> ( 2 microg / rat ) or oil once daily for four consecutive days .
<START:Disease> SE <END> was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later .
The extent of <START:Chemical> silver <END> - stained CA 3 and CA 1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after <START:Disease> SE <END> . <START:Chemical> 17 beta - Estradiol <END> did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males .
<START:Chemical> 17 beta - Estradiol <END> reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA 1 and CA 3 - C sectors of ovariectomized rats .
In males , <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> increased the total damage score .
These findings suggest that the effects of <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> on <START:Disease> seizure <END> threshold and damage may be altered by sex - related differences in the hormonal environment .
<START:Chemical> Clomipramine <END> - induced <START:Disease> sleep disturbance <END> does not impair its prolactin - releasing action .
The present study was undertaken to examine the role of <START:Disease> sleep disturbance <END> , induced by <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> administration , on the secretory rate of prolactin ( PRL ) in addition to the direct drug effect .
Two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo - controlled conditions , one during the night , when sleeping ( n = 7 ) and the other at daytime , when awake ( n = 6 ) .
Each subject received a single 50 mg dose of <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> given orally 2 hours before blood collection .
Plasma PRL concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution procedure .
For both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in PRL secretion , acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control values .
During the night <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed REM sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wakefulness .
As the relative increase in PRL secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies ( 46 + / - 19 % vs 34 + / - 10 % ) , it can be concluded that the observed <START:Disease> sleep disturbance <END> did not interfere with the drug action per se .
The presence of REM sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency , as , for both , mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> ingestion .
Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic <START:Chemical> timolol <END> with placebo on the 24 - hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> .
PURPOSE : Topical beta - blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> .
Therapy results in systemic absorption , however , the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified .
DESIGN : This trial evaluated the effect of placebo , 0 . 5 % aqueous <START:Chemical> timolol <END> ( <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution ) and a 0 . 5 % <START:Chemical> timolol <END> suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva ( <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan ) on the 24 - hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate .
METHODS : Forty - three Caucasian patients with primary <START:Disease> open - angle glaucoma <END> or <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> with a mean ( + / - SD ) age of 63 ( + / - 8 ) years were randomized and crossed over in a double - masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , or <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan ( morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening ) .
On the 13 th day of each period , heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical , ambulant 24 - hour period .
RESULTS : Both <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution and <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan reduced the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo ( P < or = . 001 ) , and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime ( - 7 . 5 % change in mean heart rate , - 5 . 7 beats / min ) .
<START:Chemical> Timolol <END> gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24 - hour heart rate , compared with <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution .
During the night , the mean 12 - hour heart rate on placebo and <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan were both significantly less than on <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution ; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant ( P = . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Both <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution and <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan decrease the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo .
This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period .
These data quantify the modest <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> associated with ophthalmic beta - blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> .
Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial , reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences .
Clinical <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> .
A prospective study .
Nearly 3 . 2 million people in this country receive <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> antibiotics annually .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin sulfate <END> and <START:Chemical> tobramycin sulfate <END> continue to demonstrate <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> and <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in both animal and clinical studies .
In this study , 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg / kg / day of <START:Chemical> gentamicin sulfate <END> or <START:Chemical> tobramycin sulfate <END> for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> - related <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , defined as at least a one - third reduction in renal function .
In these 62 patients , no other causes for <START:Disease> renal failure <END> could be identified .
Five of 33 ( 15 % ) of the <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> - treated patients and 16 of 29 ( 55 . 2 % ) of the <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated patients had <START:Disease> renal failure <END> .
Thus , <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> was associated with <START:Disease> renal failure <END> more than three times as often as was <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> .
Differential effects of <START:Chemical> gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane <END> ( <START:Chemical> lindane <END> ) on pharmacologically - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
<START:Chemical> Gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane <END> ( <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> ) , the active ingredient of the insecticide <START:Chemical> lindane <END> , has been shown to decrease <START:Disease> seizure <END> threshold to pentylenetrazol ( <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> ) 3 h after exposure to <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> and conversely increase threshold to <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> 24 h after exposure to <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> ( Vohland et al . 1981 ) .
In this study , the severity of response to other <START:Disease> seizure <END> - inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg / kg <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> .
One hour after the administration of <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> , the activity of <START:Disease> seizure <END> - inducing agents was increased , regardless of their mechanism , while 24 h after <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> a differential response was observed .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> activity due to <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> and <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTX <END> ) was significantly decreased ; however , <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity due to <START:Chemical> 3 - mercaptopropionic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> MPA <END> ) , <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> ( <START:Chemical> BCC <END> ) , <START:Chemical> methyl 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl - B - carboline - 3 - carboxylate <END> ( <START:Chemical> DMCM <END> ) , or <START:Chemical> strychnine <END> ( <START:Chemical> STR <END> ) was not different from control .
In vitro , <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> , <START:Chemical> pentylenetetrazol <END> and <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> were shown to inhibit <START:Chemical> 3 H - TBOB <END> binding in mouse whole brain , with IC 50 values of 4 . 6 , 404 and 9 . 4 microM , respectively .
<START:Chemical> MPA <END> , <START:Chemical> BCC <END> , <START:Chemical> DMCM <END> , and <START:Chemical> STR <END> showed no inhibition of <START:Chemical> 3 H - TBOB <END> ( <START:Chemical> t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate <END> ) binding at concentrations of 100 micron .
The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity induced by <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> and <START:Chemical> PTX <END> 24 h after <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> , since the response to only these two <START:Disease> seizure <END> - inducing agents is decreased .
The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity 24 h after <START:Chemical> gamma - HCH <END> may be the <START:Chemical> GABA <END> - A receptor - linked chloride channel .
<START:Chemical> Metformin <END> prevents experimental <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> by a mitochondria - dependent pathway .
The antidiabetic drug <START:Chemical> metformin <END> can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent <START:Disease> vascular dysfunction <END> even in nondiabetic patients .
Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> administration .
<START:Chemical> Metformin <END> treatment fully blocked <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - mediated <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems .
<START:Chemical> Metformin <END> also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> administration .
These in vivo markers of <START:Disease> kidney dysfunction <END> and their correction by <START:Chemical> metformin <END> were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function .
We found that <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , NADH ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores .
These injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by <START:Chemical> metformin <END> .
Thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> can lessen <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and improve mitochondrial homeostasis .
Treatment of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> urothelial toxicity <END> by oral administration of <START:Chemical> sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonate <END> ( <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> ) to patients with inoperable <START:Disease> lung cancer <END> .
The protective effect of oral administration of the <START:Chemical> thiol <END> compound <START:Chemical> sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonate <END> ( <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> ) against <START:Disease> urothelial toxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> IF <END> ) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable <START:Disease> lung cancer <END> under treatment with <START:Chemical> IF <END> ( 2250 mg / m 2 on days 2 - 5 ) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4 - week cycle .
<START:Chemical> MESNA <END> was given orally on the days of treatment with <START:Chemical> IF <END> in 3 doses of 840 mg / m 2 , each administered at 0 hr ( = injection of <START:Chemical> IF <END> ) , 4 hr and 8 hr p . i .
Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic <START:Disease> haematuria <END> and no episodes of gross <START:Disease> haematuria <END> .
In this group of 45 patients under protection with <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions ( total 31 % ) .
A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with <START:Chemical> IF <END> were treated by conventional prophylactic measures ( raised fluid intake and forced diuresis ) .
In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions ( total 24 % ) , but nearly all patients developed either gross <START:Disease> haematuria <END> and / or symptoms of <START:Disease> bladder irritation <END> ( <START:Disease> cystitis <END> and <START:Disease> pollakisuria <END> ) .
There were no appreciable differences between the <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of the cytostatic treatment .
Our results support the view that <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> , given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include <START:Chemical> IF <END> , simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium .
Protection with oral <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> is particularly suitable for outpatients .
<START:Chemical> Alpha - lipoic acid <END> prevents <START:Disease> mitochondrial damage <END> and <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> in experimental chemotherapy <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> .
The study investigates if <START:Chemical> alpha - lipoic acid <END> is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> , if <START:Disease> mitochondrial damage <END> plays a critical role in <START:Disease> toxic neurodegenerative cascade <END> , and if neuroprotective effects of <START:Chemical> alpha - lipoic acid <END> depend on mitochondria protection .
We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) sensory neurons to <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs .
This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of <START:Chemical> alpha - lipoic acid <END> in preventing <START:Disease> axonal damage <END> and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and <START:Chemical> alpha - lipoic acid <END> .
Our results demonstrate that both <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> and <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> cause early <START:Disease> mitochondrial impairment <END> with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons .
<START:Chemical> Alpha - lipoic acid <END> exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> in sensory neurons : it rescues the <START:Disease> mitochondrial toxicity <END> and induces the expression of frataxin , an essential mitochondrial protein with anti - oxidant and chaperone properties .
In conclusion <START:Disease> mitochondrial toxicity <END> is an early common event both in <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Alpha - lipoic acid <END> protects sensory neurons through its anti - oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions , possibly inducing the expression of frataxin .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> alpha - lipoic acid <END> might reduce the risk of developing <START:Disease> peripheral nerve toxicity <END> in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials .
Combined effects of prolonged <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 1 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> haemodilution <END> on human hepatic function .
Combined effects of prolonged <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 1 <END> ( <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> haemodilution <END> on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery .
The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups ; those in group A ( n = 10 ) were subjected to controlled <START:Disease> hypotension <END> alone , those in group B ( n = 10 ) to <START:Disease> haemodilution <END> alone and those in group C ( n = 10 ) to both controlled <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> haemodilution <END> .
<START:Disease> Haemodilution <END> in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of <START:Chemical> dextran <END> solution , and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22 % .
Controlled <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in groups A and C was induced with <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min .
Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio ( AKBR , <START:Chemical> aceto - acetate <END> / <START:Chemical> 3 - hydroxybutyrate <END> ) and clinical hepatic function parameters .
AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B .
In group C , AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( - 40 % ) and at 180 min ( - 49 % ) after the start of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and at 60 min ( - 32 % ) after recovery of normotension , and SGOT , SGPT , LDH and total <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> showed significant increases after operation .
The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of <START:Chemical> PGE 1 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and moderate <START:Disease> haemodilution <END> would cause <START:Disease> impairment of hepatic function <END> .
<START:Disease> Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary <END> associated with antecedent <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use .
BACKGROUND : Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
Review of the literature reveals an association between <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use and gynecologic <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
CASE : A 52 - year - old postmenopausal woman was treated with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> for stage II <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> receptor - positive <START:Disease> breast carcinoma <END> .
Her <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> transaminase and <START:Chemical> alanine <END> transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use .
After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases , the patient was found to have a stage Ic <START:Disease> granulosa cell tumor of the ovary <END> .
CONCLUSION : Patients with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver dysfunction <END> may be at increased risk for <START:Disease> granulosa cell tumors <END> because of alterations in <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> metabolism .
Placebo - level incidence of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> ( <START:Disease> EPS <END> ) with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> in controlled studies of patients with <START:Disease> bipolar mania <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> ( <START:Disease> EPS <END> ) , including <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> in patients with <START:Disease> bipolar mania <END> .
METHODS : Data were analyzed from four similarly designed , randomized , double - blind , 3 - to 12 - week studies .
Two studies evaluated <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> monotherapy ( up to 800 mg / day ) ( n = 209 ) versus placebo ( n = 198 ) , with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> or <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> monotherapy as respective active controls .
Two studies evaluated <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> ( up to 800 mg / day ) in combination with a mood stabilizer ( <START:Chemical> lithium <END> or <START:Chemical> divalproex <END> , <START:Chemical> QTP <END> + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ) ( n = 196 ) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer ( PBO + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ) ( n = 203 ) .
<START:Disease> Extrapyramidal symptoms <END> were evaluated using the Simpson - Angus Scale ( SAS ) , the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage .
RESULTS : The incidence of <START:Disease> EPS <END> - related adverse events , including <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , was no different with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> monotherapy ( 12 . 9 % ) than with placebo ( 13 . 1 % ) .
Similarly , <START:Disease> EPS <END> - related adverse events with <START:Chemical> QTP <END> + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 21 . 4 % ) were no different than with PBO + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 19 . 2 % ) .
Adverse events related to <START:Disease> EPS <END> occurred in 59 . 6 % of patients treated with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( n = 99 ) monotherapy , whereas 26 . 5 % of patients treated with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> ( n = 98 ) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to <START:Disease> EPS <END> .
The incidence of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> was low and similar with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> monotherapy ( 3 . 3 % ) and placebo ( 6 . 1 % ) , and with <START:Chemical> QTP <END> + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 3 . 6 % ) and PBO + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 4 . 9 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> was associated with a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) of <START:Disease> tremor <END> ( 18 . 4 % ) than <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> ( 5 . 6 % ) ; cerebellar <START:Disease> tremor <END> , which is a known adverse effect of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , may have contributed to the elevated rate of <START:Disease> tremor <END> in patients receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> induced a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 001 ) of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> ( 33 . 3 % versus 5 . 9 % ) , <START:Disease> tremor <END> ( 30 . 3 % versus 7 . 8 % ) , and <START:Disease> extrapyramidal syndrome <END> ( 35 . 4 % versus 5 . 9 % ) than <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> .
No significant differences were observed between <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> and placebo on SAS and BARS scores .
Anticholinergic use was low and similar with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> or placebo .
CONCLUSIONS : In <START:Disease> bipolar mania <END> , the incidence of <START:Disease> EPS <END> , including <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> therapy is similar to that with placebo .
A randomized , placebo - controlled dose - comparison trial of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> for <START:Disease> psychosis <END> and <START:Disease> disruptive behaviors <END> in <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> and placebo in the treatment of <START:Disease> psychosis <END> and <START:Disease> disruptive behaviors <END> in patients with <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
METHOD : In a 6 - week random - assignment , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( phase A ) , <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose ) , and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , 0 . 50 - 0 . 75 mg / day ( low dose ) , were compared in 71 outpatients with <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B ) , patients taking standard - or low - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> were switched to placebo , and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
RESULTS : For the 60 patients who completed phase A , standard - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> was efficacious and superior to both low - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale <START:Disease> psychosis <END> factor and on <START:Disease> psychomotor agitation <END> .
Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55 % - 60 % ) than the low dose ( 25 % - 35 % ) and placebo ( 25 % - 30 % ) .
The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B .
In phase A , <START:Disease> extrapyramidal signs <END> tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions , primarily because of a subgroup ( 20 % ) who developed moderate to severe signs .
Low - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects .
CONCLUSIONS : The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day , although a subgroup developed moderate to severe <START:Disease> extrapyramidal signs <END> .
A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual , upward dose titration is recommended .
The narrow therapeutic window observed with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> may also apply to other neuroleptics used in <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> patients with <START:Disease> psychosis <END> and <START:Disease> disruptive behaviors <END> .
Association of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> production and apoptosis in a model of experimental <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
BACKGROUND : In recent studies increased amounts of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney .
We have studied the role of <START:Chemical> NO <END> and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> induced by a single injection of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ) .
METHODS : The alteration in the <START:Chemical> NO <END> pathway was assessed by measuring <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney ( IPRK ) system .
Rats were stratified into control groups and <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> groups .
These two groups were then divided into : group 1 , animals receiving saline ; and group 2 , animals receiving <START:Chemical> aminoguanidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AG <END> ) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible - <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase .
On day 21 , rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis .
RESULTS : Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with <START:Chemical> ADR <END> revealed focal areas of <START:Disease> mesangial proliferation <END> and mild <START:Disease> tubulointerstitial inflammation <END> .
They also had significantly higher levels of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> compared with control and treatment groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Urine <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> levels were significantly increased in the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
In the IPRK <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> and <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> related responses were significantly impaired in the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group .
Apoptosis was not detected in controls .
However , in the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group , numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas .
Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED 1 , a marker for monocytes / macrophages .
Treatment with <START:Chemical> AG <END> prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> levels and apoptosis to control levels .
CONCLUSION : We suggest that interactions between <START:Chemical> NO <END> and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
Case report : <START:Chemical> Dexatrim <END> ( <START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ) as a cause of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) is a sympathetic <START:Chemical> amine <END> used in over - the - counter cold remedies and weight - control preparations worldwide .
Its use has been associated with <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> episodes and <START:Disease> hemorrhagic strokes <END> in younger women .
Several reports have linked the abuse of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> with <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> , especially when <START:Disease> overdose <END> is involved .
We report here the first case of <START:Chemical> Dexatrim <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control .
In addition , we review the 7 other cases of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> related <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> that have been reported so far .
Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> , even at doses generally considered to be safe .
Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> releaser <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl ) propionate <END> ) , the <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> releaser , on memory processes and nerve growth factor ( NGF ) synthesis were evaluated .
In the mouse passive - avoidance test , <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> ( 10 - 30 mg / kg , i . p . ) , administered 20 min before the training session , prevented <START:Disease> amnesia <END> induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> and the M 1 - selective antagonist <START:Chemical> S - ( - ) - ET - 126 <END> .
In the same experimental conditions , <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> ( 5 - 20 microg per mouse , i . c . v . ) was also able to prevent antimuscarine - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , demonstrating a central localization of the activity .
At the highest effective doses , <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test , and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity , as revealed by the hole - board test .
<START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose - dependent manner .
The maximal NGF contents obtained by <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> were 17 . 6 - fold of the control value .
During culture , no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> .
The current work indicates the ability of <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells .
Therefore , <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes .
International <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial : I . Report on <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> and other findings .
Impact Research Group .
The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Mexitil - Perlongets <END> ) were evaluated in a double - blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording .
Large differences , regarded as statistically significant , between the <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4 , but only trends were observed at month 12 .
These differences were observed even though the serum <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug .
There were more <START:Disease> deaths <END> in the <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> group ( 7 . 6 % ) than in the placebo group ( 4 . 8 % ) ; the difference was not statistically significant .
The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups .
Previously recognized side effects , particularly <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> gastrointestinal problems <END> , were more frequent in the <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> group than in the placebo group .
Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic assessment of the effects of <START:Chemical> E 4031 <END> , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , <START:Chemical> terfenadine <END> and <START:Chemical> terodiline <END> on monophasic action potential duration in dog .
1 . <START:Disease> Torsades de pointes <END> ( <START:Disease> TDP <END> ) is a potentially fatal <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> associated with increases in QT interval and monophasic action potential duration ( MAPD ) .
<START:Disease> TDP <END> is a side - effect that has led to withdrawal of several drugs from the market ( e . g . <START:Chemical> terfenadine <END> and <START:Chemical> terodiline <END> ) .
2 .
The potential of compounds to cause <START:Disease> TDP <END> was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog .
Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause <START:Disease> TDP <END> were investigated : <START:Chemical> terfenadine <END> , <START:Chemical> terodiline <END> , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> and <START:Chemical> E 4031 <END> .
On the basis that only free drug in the systemic circulation will elicit a pharmacological response target , free concentrations in plasma were selected to mimic the free drug exposures in man .
Infusion regimens were designed that rapidly achieved and maintained target - free concentrations of these drugs in plasma and data on the relationship between free concentration and changes in MAPD were obtained for these compounds .
3 .
These data indicate that the free ED 50 in plasma for <START:Chemical> terfenadine <END> ( 1 . 9 nM ) , <START:Chemical> terodiline <END> ( 76 nM ) , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> ( 11 nM ) and <START:Chemical> E 4031 <END> ( 1 . 9 nM ) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects .
For compounds that have shown <START:Disease> TDP <END> in the clinic ( <START:Chemical> terfenadine <END> , <START:Chemical> terodiline <END> , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> ) there is little differentiation between the dog ED 50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man ( < 10 - fold ) reflecting their limited safety margins .
These data underline the need to maximize the therapeutic ratio with respect to <START:Disease> TDP <END> in potential development candidates and the importance of using free drug concentrations in pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic studies .
Activation of <START:Chemical> poly ( ADP - ribose ) <END> polymerase contributes to development of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
Activation of the nuclear enzyme <START:Chemical> poly ( ADP - ribose ) <END> polymerase ( PARP ) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress .
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ) , a widely used antitumor <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> antibiotic .
Thus , we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> , we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> induced by <START:Chemical> DOX <END> .
PARP - 1 + / + and PARP - 1 - / - mice received a single injection of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ( 25 mg / kg i . p ) .
Five days after <START:Chemical> DOX <END> administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP - 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in PARP - 1 - / - ones .
Similar experiments were conducted in BALB / c mice treated with <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> or vehicle .
Treatment with a <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> significantly improved <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> and increased the survival of the animals .
In addition <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> significantly reduced the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - induced increase in the serum <START:Chemical> lactate <END> dehydrogenase and <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart .
Thus , PARP activation contributes to the <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> .
PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe <START:Disease> cardiac complications <END> associated with the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> treatment .
The hematologic effects of <START:Chemical> cefonicid <END> and <START:Chemical> cefazedone <END> in the dog : a potential model of <START:Chemical> cephalosporin <END> <START:Disease> hematotoxicity <END> in man .
<START:Chemical> Cephalosporin <END> antibiotics cause a variety of <START:Disease> hematologic disturbances <END> in man , the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized .
There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these <START:Disease> blood dyscrasias <END> can be studied .
In four subacute <START:Disease> toxicity <END> studies , the intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> cefonicid <END> or <START:Chemical> cefazedone <END> to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of <START:Disease> anemia <END> , <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> , and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> after 1 - 3 months of treatment .
A nonregenerative <START:Disease> anemia <END> was the most compromising of the <START:Disease> cytopenias <END> and occurred in approximately 50 % of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg <START:Chemical> cefonicid <END> or 540 - 840 mg / kg <START:Chemical> cefazedone <END> .
All three <START:Disease> cytopenias <END> were completely reversible following cessation of treatment ; the time required for recovery of the erythron ( approximately 1 month ) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days ) .
Upon rechallenge with either <START:Chemical> cephalosporin <END> , the <START:Disease> hematologic syndrome <END> was reproduced in most dogs tested ; <START:Chemical> cefonicid <END> ( but not <START:Chemical> cefazedone <END> ) - treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + / - 5 days ) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / - 24 days ) .
This observation , along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs , suggests that a <START:Disease> hemolytic <END> component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the <START:Disease> cytopenia <END> .
We conclude that the administration of high doses of <START:Chemical> cefonicid <END> or <START:Chemical> cefazedone <END> to dogs can induce <START:Disease> hematotoxicity <END> similar to the <START:Chemical> cephalosporin <END> - induced <START:Disease> blood dyscrasias <END> described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders .
Cardioprotective effect of <START:Chemical> tincture of Crataegus <END> on <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Tincture of Crataegus <END> ( <START:Chemical> TCR <END> ) , an <START:Chemical> alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn <END> ( <START:Chemical> Crataegus oxycantha <END> ) , is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine .
The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of <START:Chemical> TCR <END> on experimentally induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
Pretreatment of <START:Chemical> TCR <END> , at a dose of 0 . 5 mL / 100 g bodyweight per day , orally for 30 days , prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced rats ( 85 mg kg ( - 1 ) s . c . for 2 days at an interval of 24 h ) .
<START:Chemical> TCR <END> prevented the <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of <START:Chemical> ADP <END> - stimulated <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> uptake and respiratory coupling ratio .
<START:Chemical> TCR <END> protected against pathological changes induced by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> in rat heart .
The results show that pretreatment with <START:Chemical> TCR <END> may be useful in preventing the damage induced by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> in rat heart .
Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of <START:Disease> intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis <END> .
Hepatocyte tight junctions ( TJs ) , the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces , play a key role in bile formation .
Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> , attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze - fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information .
Recently , several TJ - associated proteins like ZO - 1 and 7 H 6 have been identified and characterized .
Immunolocalization of 7 H 6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability .
We used rat models of <START:Disease> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> by <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> EE <END> ) treatment and <START:Disease> extrahepatic cholestasis <END> by bile duct ligation ( BDL ) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage .
Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double - immunolabeling for 7 H 6 and ZO - 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope .
In control rats , immunostaining for 7 H 6 and ZO - 1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion .
In contrast , 7 H 6 and ZO - 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous , outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL .
Immunostaining for 7 H 6 , not ZO - 1 , decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL .
After <START:Chemical> EE <END> treatment , changes in immunostaining for 7 H 6 and ZO - 1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL , but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule .
This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and <START:Chemical> EE <END> treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability .
A <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> - dependent <START:Disease> behavioral disorder <END> unmasked by <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> .
A 3 - year - old girl had <START:Disease> behavioral deterioration <END> , with <START:Disease> hyperkinesis <END> , <START:Disease> irritability <END> , and <START:Disease> sleeping difficulties <END> after the therapeutic administration of <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> .
The administration of pharmacologic doses of <START:Chemical> pyridoxine hydrochloride <END> led to a disappearance of symptoms .
After discontinuing <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> .
A placebo had no effect , but <START:Chemical> niacinamide <END> was as effective as <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> .
Periodic withdrawal of <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> was associated with return of the <START:Disease> hyperkinesis <END> .
The level of <START:Chemical> pyridoxal <END> in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse .
Metabolic studies suggested a block in the <START:Chemical> kynurenine <END> pathway of <START:Chemical> tryptophan <END> metabolism .
The patient has been followed for six years and has required pharmacologic doses of <START:Chemical> pyridoxine <END> to control her behavior .
Post - operative <START:Disease> rigidity <END> after <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> administration .
A case of thoraco - abdominal <START:Disease> rigidity <END> leading to <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> is described in the post - operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> .
This was successfully reversed by <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
The mechanisms possibly implicated in this accident are discussed .
<START:Disease> Water intoxication <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> administration during saline - induced <START:Disease> abortion <END> .
Four cases of <START:Disease> water intoxication <END> in connection with <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> administration during saline - induced <START:Disease> abortions <END> are described .
The mechanism of <START:Disease> water intoxication <END> is discussed in regard to these cases .
<START:Chemical> Oxytocin <END> administration during midtrimester - induced <START:Disease> abortions <END> is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff , aware of the symptoms of <START:Disease> water intoxication <END> and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as <START:Disease> asthenia <END> , muscular <START:Disease> irritability <END> , or <START:Disease> headaches <END> .
The <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> should be given only in Ringers <START:Chemical> lactate <END> or , alternately , in Ringers <START:Chemical> lactate <END> and a 5 per cent <START:Chemical> dextrose <END> and water solutions .
The urinary output should be monitored and the <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases .
The <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> should not be administered in excess of 36 hours .
If the patient has not aborted by then the <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> halogenated hydroxyquinolines <END> : clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan .
An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> reactions to <START:Chemical> halogenated hydroxyquinolines <END> reported from outside Japan .
In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of <START:Chemical> clioquinol <END> could be excluded .
Of the remainder , a relationship to <START:Chemical> clioquinol <END> was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases .
In six of the probable cases the <START:Disease> neurological disturbance <END> consisted of an acute reversible <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of <START:Chemical> clioquinol <END> over a short period .
The most common manifestation , observed in 15 further cases , was isolated <START:Disease> optic atrophy <END> .
This was most frequently found in children , many of whom had received <START:Chemical> clioquinol <END> as treatment for <START:Disease> acrodermatitis enteropathica <END> .
In the remaining cases , a combination of <START:Disease> myelopathy <END> , <START:Disease> visual disturbance <END> , and <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> was the most common manifestation .
Isolated <START:Disease> myelopathy <END> or <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> , or these manifestations occurring together , were infrequent .
The onset of all manifestations ( except toxic <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> ) was usually subacute , with subsequent partial recovery .
Older subjects tended to display more side effects .
The full syndrome of subacute <START:Disease> myelo - optic neuropathy <END> was more frequent in women , but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug .
Reversible <START:Disease> cerebral lesions <END> associated with <START:Chemical> tiazofurin <END> usage : MR demonstration .
<START:Chemical> Tiazofurin <END> is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation .
We report our results with magnetic resonance ( MR ) in demonstrating reversible <START:Disease> cerebral abnormalities <END> concurrent with the use of this drug .
The abnormalities on MR were correlated with findings on CT as well as with cerebral angiography .
The utility of MR in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated .
Composition of <START:Disease> gall bladder stones <END> associated with <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> : response to oral <START:Chemical> ursodeoxycholic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Octreotide <END> , an effective treatment for <START:Disease> acromegaly <END> , induces <START:Disease> gall bladder stones <END> in 13 - 60 % of patients .
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis , treatment , and prevention , this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> treated <START:Disease> acromegalic <END> patients with <START:Disease> gall stones <END> .
Chemical analysis of <START:Disease> gall stones <END> retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients , showed that they contained 71 % and 87 % <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> by weight .
In the remaining 12 patients , localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units ( values of < 100 HU predict <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> rich , dissolvable stones ) .
Gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided , fine needle puncture from six patients .
All six patients had supersaturated bile ( mean ( SEM ) <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> saturation index of 1 . 19 ( 0 . 08 ) ( range 1 . 01 - 1 . 53 )) and all had abnormally rapid <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> microcrystal nucleation times ( < 4 days ( range 1 - 4 )) , whilst in four , the bile contained <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> microcrystals immediately after sampling .
Of the 12 patients considered for oral <START:Chemical> ursodeoxycholic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> UDCA <END> ) treatment , two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on <START:Chemical> UDCA <END> while one was lost to follow up .
After one year of treatment , five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3 ) or complete ( n = 2 ) <START:Disease> gall stone <END> dissolution , suggesting that their stones were <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> rich .
This corresponds , by actuarial ( life table ) analysis , to a combined <START:Disease> gall stone <END> dissolution rate of 58 . 3 ( 15 . 9 % ) .
In conclusion , <START:Chemical> octreotide <END> induced <START:Disease> gall stones <END> are generally small , multiple , and <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> rich although , in common with spontaneous <START:Disease> gall stone disease <END> , at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some <START:Disease> gall stones <END> containing <START:Chemical> calcium <END> .
A case of <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> caused by <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> .
<START:Disease> Abnormal involuntary movements <END> appeared in the mouth , tongue , neck and abdomen of a 64 - year - old male patient after he took <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> for <START:Disease> gastrointestinal disorder <END> in a regimen of 30 mg per day for a total of about 260 days .
The symptoms exacerbated to a maximum in a month .
When the <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> administration was discontinued , the <START:Disease> abnormal movements <END> gradually improved to a considerable extent .
Attention to the possible induction of specific <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> is called for in the use of this drug .
Modification of drug action by <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> ammonium acetate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> ) ( 6 mmol / kg s . c . ) approximately doubled the time <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular <START:Disease> incoordination <END> by <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , but <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> treatment alone had no effect .
Thus , <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with <START:Disease> liver disease <END> .
Experiments in vitro showed that <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> - induced <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50 % by 0 . 3 mM <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> and <START:Chemical> KCl <END> - induced contractions of guinea - pig ileum were inhibited 20 % by 5 mM <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> .
Addition of excess <START:Chemical> calcium <END> reversed the <START:Disease> depression <END> in both tissues , but <START:Chemical> calcium <END> - independent <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> release by <START:Chemical> acetaldehyde <END> was not blocked by <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> .
These results suggested that <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> blocks <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channels .
Parallels in the actions of <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> and the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> support this concept .
Both <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> ( 10 mg / kg i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> pretreatment enhanced <START:Chemical> morphine <END> <START:Disease> analgesia <END> - and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced muscular <START:Disease> incoordination <END> and antagonized <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced motor activity , and neither <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> nor <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> affected the convulsant action of <START:Chemical> metrazol <END> .
The data suggest that <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> exerts a <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics .
<START:Chemical> Hydrocortisone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in humans : pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function .
Oral <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects .
We studied the effects of 1 week of oral <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> ( 200 mg / day ) on blood pressure , cardiac output , total peripheral resistance , forearm vascular resistance , and <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers .
Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged , systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg ( SED + / - 3 . 4 , p less than 0 . 01 ) , associated with an <START:Disease> increased cardiac output <END> ( 5 . 85 - 7 . 73 l / min , SED + / - 0 . 46 , p less than 0 . 01 ) .
Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15 . 1 to 12 . 2 mm Hg / l / min ( SED + / - 1 . 03 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged , but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated , the rise in resistance increasing from 10 . 5 mm Hg / ml / 100 ml / min ( R units ) before treatment to 32 . 6 R units after treatment ( SED + / - 6 . 4 , p less than 0 . 025 ) .
The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra - arterial <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ( 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / min ) was also significantly greater after <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> , increasing from an average of 14 . 9 + / - 2 . 4 R units before treatment to 35 . 1 + / - 5 . 5 R units after <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> ( SED + / - 6 . 0 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
A shift to the left in the dose - response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> after treatment .
Measurement of resting <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> spillover rate to plasma and <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased .
The <START:Disease> rise in resting blood pressure <END> with <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> is associated with an <START:Disease> increased cardiac output <END> ( presumably due to increased blood volume ) . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Chemical> Nitric oxide <END> synthase expression in the course of <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
We recently showed elevated reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species ( ROS ) , reduced urinary excretion of <START:Chemical> NO <END> metabolites ( NOx ) , and increased <START:Chemical> NO <END> sequestration as <START:Chemical> nitrotyrosine <END> in various tissues in rats with <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> is , in part , due to depressed <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase ( NOS ) expression .
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a <START:Chemical> lead <END> - treated group ( given <START:Chemical> lead acetate <END> , 100 ppm , in drinking water and regular rat chow ) , a group given <START:Chemical> lead <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> - fortified chow , or a normal control group given either regular food and water or <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> - fortified food for 12 weeks .
Tail blood pressure , urinary NOx excretion , plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> ( <START:Chemical> MDA <END> ) , and endothelial and inducible NOS ( eNOS and iNOS ) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured .
The <START:Chemical> lead <END> - treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma <START:Chemical> MDA <END> concentration , a fall in urinary NOx excretion , and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin E <END> supplementation ameliorated <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , lowered plasma <START:Chemical> MDA <END> concentration , and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular , but not renal , tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin E <END> supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure , plasma <START:Chemical> MDA <END> , or NOS expression in the control group .
The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by <START:Chemical> lead <END> in cell - free preparations .
In conclusion , <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression .
This is , in part , due to ROS - mediated <START:Chemical> NO <END> inactivation , <START:Chemical> lead <END> - associated inhibition of NOS activity , and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
<START:Chemical> Procainamide <END> - induced polymorphous <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
Seven cases of <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> - induced polymorphous <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> are presented .
In four patients , polymorphous <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> for the treatment of sustained <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
In the remaining three patients , <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> was administered orally for treatment of chronic <START:Disease> premature ventricular contractions <END> or <START:Disease> atrial flutter <END> .
These patients had <START:Disease> Q - T prolongation <END> and recurrent <START:Disease> syncope <END> due to polymorphous <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
In four patients , the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> .
In two patients , the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> degenerated into irreversible <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> and both patients died .
In the seventh patient , a permanent ventricular pacemaker was inserted and , despite continuation of <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> therapy , polymorphous <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> did not reoccur .
These seven cases demonstrate that <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> can produce an acquired <START:Disease> prolonged Q - T syndrome <END> with polymorphous <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
Test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in rodents .
These studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug - induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in rodents .
<START:Chemical> Apomorphine <END> , a nonselective <START:Chemical> dopamine agonist <END> , was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects , its ability to induce <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> , and to produce distinct changes to <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> turnover in the rodent brain .
From such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employed .
In rats , detection of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> was facilitated by a period of acclimatization to the test conditions .
Moreover , test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> such as drug - induced <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> .
In mice , <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test cage .
Drug - induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only , while measures of stereotypic behavior were similar in both .
By contrast , <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory box .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> turnover ratios ( <START:Chemical> DOPAC <END> : <START:Chemical> DA <END> and <START:Chemical> HVA <END> : <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counterparts .
However , <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced reductions in striatal <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environments .
The implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmacological challenge tests in rodents .
<START:Chemical> Atorvastatin <END> prevented and reversed <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in the rat .
To assess the antioxidant effects of <START:Chemical> atorvastatin <END> ( <START:Chemical> atorva <END> ) on <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> ( <START:Chemical> dex <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , 60 male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with <START:Chemical> atorva <END> 30 mg / kg / day or tap water for 15 days .
<START:Chemical> Dex <END> increased systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) from 109 + / - 1 . 8 to 135 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg and plasma <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> ( 5711 + / - 284 . 9 saline , 7931 + / - 392 . 8 U / ml <START:Chemical> dex <END> , P < 0 . 001 ) .
In this prevention study , SBP in the <START:Chemical> atorva <END> + <START:Chemical> dex <END> group was increased from 115 + / - 0 . 4 to 124 + / - 1 . 5 mmHg , but this was significantly lower than in the <START:Chemical> dex <END> - only group ( P ' < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Atorva <END> reversed <START:Chemical> dex <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> ( 129 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg , vs . 135 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg P ' < 0 . 05 ) and decreased plasma <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> ( 7931 + / - 392 . 8 <START:Chemical> dex <END> , 1187 + / - 441 . 2 <START:Chemical> atorva <END> + <START:Chemical> dex <END> , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Plasma <START:Chemical> nitrate <END> / <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> ( NOx ) was decreased in <START:Chemical> dex <END> - treated rats compared to saline - treated rats ( 11 . 2 + / - 1 . 08 microm , 15 . 3 + / - 1 . 17 microm , respectively , P < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Atorva <END> affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight .
Thus , <START:Chemical> atorvastatin <END> prevented and reversed <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in the rat .
<START:Chemical> Glyceryl trinitrate <END> induces attacks of <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> in sufferers of <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
<START:Disease> Migraine with aura <END> and <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> have the same <START:Disease> pain <END> phase , thus indicating that <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> and <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> share a common pathway of nociception .
In recent years , increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) is involved in <START:Disease> pain <END> mechanisms of <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> .
In order to clarify whether the same is true for <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> , in the present study we examined the <START:Disease> headache <END> response to intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> GTN <END> ) ( 0 . 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min ) in 12 sufferers of <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> could be induced .
Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls .
Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject .
<START:Disease> Headache <END> was more severe in <START:Disease> migraineurs <END> than in the controls during and immediately after <START:Chemical> GTN <END> infusion ( p = 0 . 037 ) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0 . 008 ) .
In the controls , the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> - induced <START:Disease> headache <END> gradually disappeared , whereas in <START:Disease> migraineurs <END> peak <START:Disease> headache <END> intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion .
At this time the induced <START:Disease> headache <END> in 6 of 12 <START:Disease> migraineurs <END> fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> of the International <START:Disease> Headache <END> Society .
The results therefore suggest that <START:Chemical> NO <END> is involved in the <START:Disease> pain <END> mechanisms of <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
Since cortical spreading <START:Disease> depression <END> has been shown to liberate <START:Chemical> NO <END> in animals , this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading <START:Disease> depression <END> and <START:Disease> headache <END> in <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
Amelioration of <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> by <START:Chemical> timolol <END> .
The beta adrenergic blocking drug , <START:Chemical> timolol <END> , tended to correct the <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> of short - term <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant .
<START:Chemical> Timolol <END> also reduced the rise in plasma <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> and urine <START:Chemical> potassium <END> excretion following <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> and increased the urine <START:Chemical> sodium <END> / <START:Chemical> potassium <END> ratio .
There was no evidence of a shift of <START:Chemical> potassium <END> from the intracellular to the extracellular space .
Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and <START:Disease> hepatoma <END> of mice induced by <START:Chemical> alpha - benzene hexachloride <END> .
Peroxisomes in <START:Disease> hepatomas <END> and hyperplastic preneoplastic <START:Disease> liver lesions <END> induced in mice by 500 ppm <START:Chemical> alpha - benzene hexachloride <END> were examined histochemically and electron microscopically .
Although most of the <START:Disease> hepatomas <END> were well - differentiated <START:Disease> tumors <END> and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes , the <START:Disease> tumor <END> cells did not respond to <START:Chemical> ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate <END> with proliferation of peroxisomes .
At the 16 th week of carcinogen feeding , hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages .
A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes .
Within the nodules , foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared .
These cells proliferated further , replacing the most part of the nodules , and with this process <START:Disease> hepatomas <END> appeared to have been formed .
No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by <START:Chemical> ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate <END> unlike in the case of rats .
Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged <START:Disease> apnea <END> after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> for electroconvulsive therapy .
BACKGROUND : patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) often receive <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> as part of the anesthetic procedure .
The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme ( BChE ) , the most common being the K - and the A - variants .
The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene ( BCHE ) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> after ECT .
METHODS : a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months .
We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods , the duration of <START:Disease> apnea <END> , time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used .
The duration of <START:Disease> apnea <END> was compared with published data on normal subjects .
RESULTS : in 11 patients , mutations were found in the BCHE gene , the K - variant being the most frequent .
The duration of <START:Disease> apnea <END> was 5 - 15 min compared with 3 - 5 . 3 min from the literature .
Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients .
Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients .
CONCLUSION : eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> had mutations in BCHE , indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of <START:Disease> apnea <END> .
We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT .
Involvement of the mu - opiate receptor in peripheral <START:Disease> analgesia <END> .
The intradermal injection of mu ( <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , <START:Chemical> Tyr - D - Ala - Gly - NMe - Phe - Gly - ol <END> and <START:Chemical> morphiceptin <END> ) , kappa ( <START:Chemical> trans - 3 , 4 - dichloro - N - methyl - N [ 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexyl ] benzeneactemide <END> ) and delta ( <START:Chemical> [ D - Pen 2 . 5 ] - enkephalin <END>
and <START:Chemical> [ D - Ser 2 ] - [ Leu ] enkephalin - Thr <END> ) selective opioid - agonists , by themselves , did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat .
Intradermal injection of mu , but not delta or kappa opioid - agonists , however , produced dose - dependent inhibition of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
The analgesic effect of the mu - agonist <START:Chemical> morphine <END> was dose - dependently antagonized by <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> and prevented by co - injection of pertussis toxin .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> did not , however , alter the <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> 8 - bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate <END> .
We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu - opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the <START:Chemical> cyclic adenosine monophosphate <END> second messenger system .
Absence of effect of <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> on time - based sensitization of <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
This double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study evaluated the effects of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> alone and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> plus <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects .
METHOD : All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> 2 mg on Days 2 and 25 .
From Days 9 to 25 , subjects were randomly assigned to either <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> ( 12 subjects ) or placebo ( 12 subjects ) ; the <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg / day from Days 9 to 16 , and remained at 200 mg / day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period .
Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24 - hour period after dosing on Days 1 , 2 , and 25 .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Impairment of cognitive function <END> was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing .
When single - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> was given again 25 days later , greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups , suggesting enhancement of this effect .
There was no indication that <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> exacerbated the impairment produced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group .
Three subjects ( 2 on <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> and 1 on placebo ) withdrew from the study because of side effects .
Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment .
The side effect profiles of <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> and of placebo were similar .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> produced a clear profile of <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> that was not worsened by concomitant <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> administration .
Coexistence of <START:Disease> cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis <END> associated with exogenous sex hormones .
A case report .
A forty - six year - old premenopausal woman developed <START:Disease> headache <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , left <START:Disease> hemiparesis <END> and <START:Disease> seizure <END> two days after parenteral use of <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> and <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> .
<START:Disease> Diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:Disease> DM <END> ) was found during admission .
Computed tomography showed a <START:Disease> hemorrhagic infarct <END> in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus ( SSS ) .
Left carotid angiography found <START:Disease> occlusion of the left internal carotid artery <END> ( ICA ) .
Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus , suggestive of <START:Disease> venous sinus thrombosis <END> .
Coexistence of the <START:Disease> cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion <END> has been described infrequently .
In this case , the authors postulate that the use of <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> and <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> and the underlying <START:Disease> DM <END> increased vascular thrombogenicity , which provided a common denominator for <START:Disease> thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus <END> .
<START:Disease> Choreoathetoid movements <END> associated with rapid adjustment to <START:Chemical> methadone <END> .
<START:Disease> Choreatiform hyperkinesias <END> are known to be occasional <START:Disease> movement abnormalities <END> during intoxications with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> but not opiates .
This is a case report of euphoria and <START:Disease> choreoathetoid movements <END> both transiently induced by rapid adjustment to the selective mu - opioid receptor agonist <START:Chemical> methadone <END> in an inpatient previously abusing <START:Chemical> heroine <END> and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
In addition , minor EEG abnormalities occurred .
Possible underlying neurobiological phenomena are discussed .
Does hormone therapy for the treatment of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> have a <START:Disease> detrimental effect on memory and cognition <END> ?
A pilot study .
This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> affects cognition .
Patients participating in a randomised trial of <START:Chemical> anastrozole <END> , <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> alone or combined ( ATAC ) ( n = 94 ) and a group of women without <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> ( n = 35 ) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures .
Compared with the control group , the patients were impaired on a processing speed task ( p = 0 . 032 ) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory ( p = 0 . 026 ) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups .
Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity .
The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in <START:Chemical> oestrogen <END> levels , a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women .
In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly .
<START:Disease> Torsade de pointes <END> induced by <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> in an elderly woman with preexisting complete <START:Disease> left bundle branch block <END> .
There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired <START:Disease> long QT syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
However , the torsadogenic potential of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> , a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug , has not been reported in the literature , despite its chemical similarity to <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> .
We report on a 92 - year - old woman with preexisting complete <START:Disease> left bundle branch block <END> who developed <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> after intravenous and oral administration of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> .
This patient also developed <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> when <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> and <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> were given simultaneously .
These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs .
This is the first documentation that <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> provokes <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> clinically .
<START:Chemical> Metoclopramide <END> should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> induced by the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> metabolite <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> in rats .
The half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> is relatively short , but some of the consequences of its use , such as <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> strokes <END> , can occur hours after exposure .
This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae .
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> , <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> ( <START:Chemical> BE <END> ) , to cause <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Two separate equimolar doses ( 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 mumol ) of either <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or <START:Chemical> BE <END> were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats .
Treated rats were then evaluated for incidence , latency , and <START:Disease> seizure <END> pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
<START:Chemical> BE <END> - Induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
Whereas <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> were best characterized as brief , generalized , and tonic and resulted in <START:Disease> death <END> , those induced by <START:Chemical> BE <END> were prolonged , often multiple and mixed in type , and rarely resulted in <START:Disease> death <END> .
Electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in EEG frequency and voltage with clinical <START:Disease> seizure <END> expression .
<START:Chemical> BE <END> - Injected rats that did not have <START:Disease> seizures <END> had significantly more locomotor activity than <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - injected animals without <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The finding that <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - and <START:Chemical> BE <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and emphasizes the importance of a <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> metabolite , <START:Chemical> BE <END> .
Randomized , double - blind trial of <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> in <START:Disease> Duchenne dystrophy <END> .
There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of <START:Disease> weakness <END> in <START:Disease> Duchenne dystrophy <END> .
We conducted a 12 - month controlled trial of <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> , a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor , in 83 boys with <START:Disease> Duchenne dystrophy <END> .
Muscle strength , contractures , functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline , and 6 and 12 months after treatment with <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> ( 3 mg / d ) or placebo .
The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0 . 90 to detect a slowing to 25 % of the expected rate of progression of <START:Disease> weakness <END> at P less than 0 . 05 .
<START:Chemical> Mazindol <END> did not benefit strength at any point in the study .
Side effects attributable to <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> included <START:Disease> decreased appetite <END> ( 36 % ) , <START:Disease> dry mouth <END> ( 10 % ) , behavioral change ( 22 % ) , and <START:Disease> gastrointestinal symptoms <END> ( 18 % ) ; <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> dosage was reduced in 43 % of patients .
The effect of <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF - I levels obtained following 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months in the <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> treated to those in the placebo groups .
Although <START:Chemical> mazindol <END> - treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo - treated patients , no significant effect on IGF - I levels was observed .
<START:Chemical> Mazindol <END> doses not slow the progression of <START:Disease> weakness <END> in <START:Disease> Duchenne dystrophy <END> .
Lethal <START:Disease> anuria <END> complicating high dose <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> chemotherapy in a <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> patient with an <START:Disease> impaired renal function <END> .
A sixty - year - old woman with advanced <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , previously treated with <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , developed an irreversible lethal <START:Disease> renal failure <END> with <START:Disease> anuria <END> , the day after 5 g / m 2 bolus <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> .
<START:Disease> Postrenal failure <END> was excluded by echography .
A prerenal component could have contributed to <START:Disease> renal failure <END> because of a transient <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , due to an increasing ascitis , occurring just before <START:Disease> anuria <END> .
However , correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function .
<START:Chemical> Ifosfamide <END> is a known <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> drug with demonstrated <START:Disease> tubulopathies <END> .
We strongly suspect that this lethal <START:Disease> anuria <END> was mainly due to <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> , occurring in a patient having received previous <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
We recommend careful use of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> in patients pretreated with <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion .
Attenuation of the <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome <END> by <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> in rats .
The effect of <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> on <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polydipsia <END> and <START:Disease> polyuria <END> and on the <START:Chemical> lithium <END> concentration in the plasma , brain , kidney , thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats , chronically treated with <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiloride <END> reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute ( 6 or 12 h ) and a subacute ( 3 days ) experiment .
6 h after the administration of <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> , a reduction was observed in the <START:Chemical> lithium <END> content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied .
At 12 h , all the tissues showed a slight increase in <START:Chemical> lithium <END> levels .
After 3 days of combined treatment , a marked elevation in plasma and tissue <START:Chemical> lithium <END> levels accompanied a reduction in water intake .
In all the experiments , the attenuation of the <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes - insipidus - like syndrome <END> by <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the <START:Chemical> lithium <END> concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> level .
It is concluded that acute <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> administration to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - treated patients suffering from <START:Disease> polydipsia <END> and <START:Disease> polyuria <END> might relieve these patients but prolonged <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> supplementation would result in elevated <START:Chemical> lithium <END> levels and might be hazardous .
<START:Chemical> Glycopyrronium <END> requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> .
We have compared , in 60 adult patients , the cardiovascular effects of <START:Chemical> glycopyrronium <END> 5 micrograms kg - 1 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> 1 mg kg - 1 .
Significant differences between the four groups were detected ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg - 1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min - 1 ( 95 % confidence limits 28 - 32 beat min - 1 ) .
Use of <START:Chemical> glycopyrronium <END> 5 micrograms kg - 1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and , given 1 min before the <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> , was sufficient to minimize early , <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardias <END> .
This low dose of <START:Chemical> glycopyrronium <END> provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions .
Acute effects of <START:Chemical> N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea <END> on hippocampal <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> neurotransmitters in <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizure <END> in rats .
The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> neurotransmitters ( <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> , <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> , <START:Chemical> glycine <END> and <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ) of <START:Chemical> N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPU <END> ) in comparison to its parent compound , <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> VPU <END> was more potent than <START:Chemical> VPA <END> , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED ( 50 )) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizure <END> whereas the corresponding value for <START:Chemical> VPA <END> was 322 mg / kg .
In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> whereas no significant change was observed on the level of <START:Chemical> glycine <END> and <START:Chemical> GABA <END> .
Pretreatment with either <START:Chemical> VPU <END> ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - evoked increases in extracellular <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> .
In addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of <START:Chemical> GABA <END> and <START:Chemical> glycine <END> but less than a drastic reduction of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> level .
Based on the finding that <START:Chemical> VPU <END> and <START:Chemical> VPA <END> could protect the animals against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizure <END> it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> .
Therefore , like <START:Chemical> VPA <END> , the finding that <START:Chemical> VPU <END> could drastically reduce <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced increases in <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant activity observed in <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizure <END> in experimental animals .
Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated .
<START:Disease> Rabbit syndrome <END> , <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> use , and cerebral perfusion SPECT scan findings .
The <START:Disease> rabbit syndrome <END> is an extrapyramidal side effect associated with chronic neuroleptic therapy .
Its occurrence in a patient being treated with <START:Chemical> imipramine <END> is described , representing the first reported case of this syndrome in conjunction with <START:Chemical> antidepressants <END> .
Repeated cerebral perfusion SPECT scans revealed <START:Disease> decreased basal ganglia perfusion <END> while the <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> was present , and a return to normal perfusion when the <START:Disease> rabbit syndrome <END> resolved .
Variant <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> in <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
We report a case of variant <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Unusual features of the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> are repetitive group beating , progressive shortening of the R - R interval , progressive widening of the QRS complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction , and changes in direction of the QRS axis .
Recognition of variant <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> is important because therapy differs from that of classic <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
Risks of the consumption of beverages containing <START:Chemical> quinine <END> .
Although the United States Food and Drug Administration banned its use for <START:Disease> nocturnal leg cramps <END> due to lack of safety and efficacy , <START:Chemical> quinine <END> is widely available in beverages including tonic water and bitter lemon .
Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that products containing <START:Chemical> quinine <END> may produce <START:Disease> neurological complications <END> , including <START:Disease> confusion <END> , altered mental status , <START:Disease> seizures <END> , and <START:Disease> coma <END> , particularly in older women .
Psychologists need to inquire about consumption of <START:Chemical> quinine <END> - containing beverages as part of an evaluation process .
Effect of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> therapy on <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in rats .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hypotension <END> is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit <START:Chemical> calcium <END> influx in some tissues .
This study addressed the potential role of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
METHODS : Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
<START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> .
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> IP to produce <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , QRS prolongation , and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
Fifteen min later , animals received <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> , <START:Chemical> NaHCO 3 <END> , or saline .
In a second experiment , rats received tricyclic antidepressant <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> IP followed in 15 min by <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> or saline .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> NaHCO 3 <END> briefly ( 5 min ) reversed <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and QRS prolongation .
<START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> failed to improve blood pressure .
The incidence of <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> ( p = 0 . 004 ) and <START:Disease> seizures <END> ( p = 0 . 03 ) in the <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> group was higher than the other groups .
CONCLUSION : The administration of <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> or <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> therapy may possibly worsen both <START:Disease> cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity <END> .
These findings do not support a role for <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The renal pathology in a case of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes insipidus <END> .
A case of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes insipidus <END> is reported .
At necropsy microscopy shoed unique and extensive damage to cells lining the distal nephron .
It is suggested that these changes represent a specific toxic effect of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , reported here for the first time in man .
Effects of <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> on myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply and demand in patients with chronic <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
A hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic study in patients without <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> digitalis glycosides <END> on myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , but have not been measured previously in man .
We assessed the effects of <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> ( 0 . 015 mg / kg body weight ) on hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> without clinical <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> .
Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations , we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> administration was omitted .
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell in each patient given <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> , even though they were initially elevated in only two patients .
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure fell from 11 . 5 + / - 1 . 4 ( mean + / - SE ) to 5 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell from 100 + / - 17 to 82 + / - 12 ml / m 2 ( P less than 0 . 01 ) 1 h after <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> infusion was completed .
The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1 . 68 + / - 0 . 11 ml / s to 2 . 18 + / - 0 . 21 muscle - lengths / s ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and is consistent with an increase in contractility .
No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients .
No significant change in myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption occurred after <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> patients than in the control patients .
We conclude that in patients with chronic <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> who are not in clinical <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> <START:Disease> left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls <END> after <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> administration even when it is initially normal .
Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption .
Nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism .
Progressive <START:Disease> myopathy <END> with up - regulation of MHC - I associated with <START:Chemical> statin <END> therapy .
<START:Chemical> Statins <END> can cause a necrotizing <START:Disease> myopathy <END> and <START:Disease> hyperCKaemia <END> which is reversible on cessation of the drug .
What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby <START:Chemical> statins <END> may induce a <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , which persists or may progress after stopping the drug .
We investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cases .
All had myofibre <START:Disease> necrosis <END> but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltrate .
In all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up - regulation of MHC - I expression even in non - <START:Disease> necrotic <END> fibres .
Progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> and <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> , and in one case spontaneously .
These observations suggest that <START:Chemical> statins <END> may initiate an immune - mediated <START:Disease> myopathy <END> that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therapy .
The mechanism of this <START:Disease> myopathy <END> is uncertain but may involve the induction by <START:Chemical> statins <END> of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up - regulation of MHC - I expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres .
<START:Disease> Angiosarcoma of the liver <END> associated with <START:Chemical> diethylstilbestrol <END> .
<START:Disease> Angiosarcoma of the liver <END> occurred in a 76 - year - old man who had been treated for a well - differentiated <START:Disease> adenocarcinoma of the liver <END> with <START:Chemical> diethylstilbestrol <END> for 13 years .
<START:Disease> Angiosarcoma <END> was also present within pulmonary and renal arteries .
The possibility that the <START:Disease> intraarterial lesions <END> might represent independent primary <START:Disease> tumors <END> is considered .
Reduction of <START:Disease> pain <END> during induction with target - controlled <START:Chemical> propofol <END> and <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Pain <END> on injection of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> is unpleasant .
We hypothesized that <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion <START:Disease> pain <END> might be prevented by infusing <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> before starting the <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion in a clinical setting where target - controlled infusions ( TCI ) of both drugs were used .
A prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was performed to determine the effect - site concentration ( Ce ) of <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> to prevent the <START:Disease> pain <END> without producing complications .
METHODS : A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline ( control ) or <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> to a target Ce of 2 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R 2 ) , 4 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R 4 ) , or 6 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R 6 ) administered via TCI .
After the target Ce was achieved , the infusion of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> was started .
<START:Chemical> Remifentanil <END> - related complications were assessed during the <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> infusion , and <START:Disease> pain <END> caused by <START:Chemical> propofol <END> was evaluated using a four - point scale during the <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion .
RESULTS : The incidence of <START:Disease> pain <END> was significantly lower in Groups R 4 and R 6 than in the control and R 2 groups ( 12 / 32 and 6 / 31 vs 26 / 31 and 25 / 32 , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> was less severe in Groups R 4 and R 6 than in the control and R 2 groups ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
However , both incidence and severity of <START:Disease> pain <END> were not different between Groups R 4 and R 6 .
No significant complications were observed during the study .
CONCLUSIONS : During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> and <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> , a significant reduction in <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion <START:Disease> pain <END> was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> at a target Ce of 4 ng ml ( - 1 ) .
Consensus statement concerning <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of <START:Disease> autoimmune diseases <END> , with special reference to <START:Disease> systemic sclerosis <END> and <START:Disease> multiple sclerosis <END> .
Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe <START:Disease> autoimmune diseases <END> .
Worldwide , over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials .
The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials .
However , as predicted , significant transplant - related morbidity and mortality have been observed .
This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to <START:Disease> infections <END> .
The number of deaths related to <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> is low .
However , caution is required when <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> or <START:Chemical> anthracyclines <END> such as <START:Chemical> mitoxantrone <END> are used in patients with a possible underlying <START:Disease> heart damage <END> , for example , <START:Disease> systemic sclerosis <END> patients .
In November 2002 , a meeting was held in Florence , bringing together a number of experts in various fields , including rheumatology , cardiology , neurology , pharmacology and transplantation medicine .
The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data , both published or available , in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation <START:Disease> autoimmune disease <END> database , and to propose a safe approach to such patients .
A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation .
<START:Disease> Cerebral haemorrhage <END> induced by <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - the influence of drug - drug interactions .
PURPOSE : To evaluate the frequency , severity and preventability of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhages <END> due to <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> and <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - drug interactions in patients living in the county of Osterg tland , Sweden .
METHODS : All patients with a diagnosed <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhage <END> at three hospitals during the period 2000 - 2002 were identified .
Medical records were studied retrospectively to evaluate whether <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> and <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - drug interactions could have caused the <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhage <END> .
The proportion of possibly avoidable cases due to drug interactions was estimated .
RESULTS : Among 593 patients with <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhage <END> , 59 ( 10 % ) were assessed as related to <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> treatment .
This imply an incidence of 1 . 7 / 100 , 000 treatment years .
Of the 59 cases , 26 ( 44 % ) had a fatal outcome , compared to 136 ( 25 % ) among the non - <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> patients ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
A <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - drug interaction could have contributed to the <START:Disease> haemorrhage <END> in 24 ( 41 % ) of the <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> patients and in 7 of these ( 12 % ) the <START:Disease> bleeding <END> complication was considered being possible to avoid .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhages <END> are a major clinical problem with a high fatality rate .
Almost half of the cases was related to a <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - drug interaction .
A significant proportion of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - related <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhages <END> might have been prevented if greater caution had been taken when prescribing drugs known to interact with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
<START:Chemical> Daidzein <END> activates <START:Chemical> choline <END> acetyltransferase from MC - IXC cells and improves drug - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
The <START:Chemical> choline <END> acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) activator , which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ACh <END> ) , is an important factor in the treatment of <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> AD <END> ) .
Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect ( 46 % ) on ChAT in vitro .
Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana , the active component was ultimately identified as <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> ( <START:Chemical> 4 ' , 7 - dihydroxy - isoflavone <END> ) .
In order to investigate the effects of <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> from Pueraria thunbergiana on <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> impairments of learning and memory <END> , we conducted a series of in vivo tests .
Administration of <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> ( 4 . 5 mg / kg body weight ) to mice was shown significantly to reverse <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , according to the results of a Y - maze test .
Injections of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y - maze tests ( a 37 % decreases in alternation behavior ) .
By way of contrast , mice treated with <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> prior to the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment ( an approximately 12 % - 21 % decrease in alternation behavior ) .
These results indicate that <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> might play a role in <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> biosynthesis as a ChAT activator , and that it also ameliorates <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
Effects of 5 - HT 1 B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> in rats .
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5 - HT 1 B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens ( the shell and the core ) on the <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> in rats .
Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core , and then were locally injected with <START:Chemical> GR 55562 <END> ( an antagonist of 5 - HT 1 B receptors ) or <START:Chemical> CP 93129 <END> ( an agonist of 5 - HT 1 B receptors ) .
Given alone to any accumbal subregion , <START:Chemical> GR 55562 <END> ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) or <START:Chemical> CP 93129 <END> ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) did not change basal locomotor activity .
Systemic <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats .
<START:Chemical> GR 55562 <END> ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) , administered intra - accumbens shell prior to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> , dose - dependently attenuated the psychostimulant - induced <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> .
Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with <START:Chemical> GR 55562 <END> into the accumbens core .
When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core ) before <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> , <START:Chemical> CP 93129 <END> ( 0 . 1 - 10 microg / side ) enhanced the locomotor response to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> ; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist .
The later enhancement was attenuated after intra - accumbens shell treatment with <START:Chemical> GR 55562 <END> ( 1 microg / side ) .
Our findings indicate that <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> induced <START:Disease> hyperlocomotion <END> is modified by 5 - HT 1 B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell , but not core , this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5 - HT 1 B receptor antagonist ( <START:Chemical> GR 55562 <END> ) and agonist ( <START:Chemical> CP 93129 <END> ) , respectively .
In other words , the present results suggest that the accumbal shell 5 - HT 1 B receptors play a permissive role in the behavioural response to the psychostimulant .
<START:Disease> Erythema multiforme <END> and <START:Disease> hypersensitivity myocarditis <END> caused by <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of <START:Disease> erythema multiforme <END> and <START:Disease> hypersensitivity myocarditis <END> caused by <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 13 - year - old boy was treated with <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> because of suspected <START:Disease> septicemia <END> .
Medications were discontinued when <START:Disease> erythema multiforme <END> and <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> caused by <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> occurred .
The patient was treated with <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> and gradually improved .
Macrophage - migration inhibition ( MIF ) test with <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> was positive .
DISCUSSION : After most <START:Disease> infections <END> causing <START:Disease> erythema multiforme <END> and <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> were ruled out , a <START:Disease> drug - induced allergic reaction <END> was suspected .
Positive MIF test for <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> showed sensitization of the patient ' s lymphocytes to <START:Chemical> ampicillin <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Hypersensitivity myocarditis <END> is a rare and dangerous manifestation of <START:Disease> allergy <END> to <START:Chemical> penicillins <END> .
A case of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> related to <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> pretreatment .
Suboptimal <START:Disease> seizure <END> duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice , especially in older patients with higher <START:Disease> seizure <END> thresholds .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> is commonly used to improve <START:Disease> seizure <END> duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign <START:Disease> ventricular ectopy <END> .
We describe a patient with no previous history of <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> or <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> after <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> administration .
Although intravenous <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> is generally well tolerated , the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
Arterial <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> in patients receiving systemic <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy : a complication associated with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
Arterial <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> is a recognized complication of systemic <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy .
Characteristic of the entity is <START:Disease> arterial occlusion <END> by platelet - fibrin <START:Disease> thrombi <END> with distal <START:Disease> ischemia <END> occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy , preceded by profound <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> with platelet counts in the range of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 per cubic millimeter .
The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by <START:Disease> gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms <END> that appear to be <START:Disease> ischemic <END> in origin , and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications .
Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> are reviewed .
The common factor relating <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> is <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> .
Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , and anticoagulation with <START:Chemical> sodium warfarin <END> if necessary .
Vascular procedures are performed as indicated .
Late , late <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiac toxicity <END> is a major complication which limits the use of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> as a chemotherapeutic agent .
<START:Disease> Cardiomyopathy <END> is frequent when the total dose exceeds 600 mg / m 2 and occurs within one to six months after cessation of therapy .
A patient is reported who developed progressive <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> two and one - half years after receiving 580 mg / m 2 which apparently represents late , late <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin E 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> bladder hyperactivity <END> in normal , conscious rats : involvement of <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> ?
In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry , intravesically instilled <START:Chemical> prostaglandin ( PG ) E 2 <END> facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure .
The effect was attenuated by both the NK 1 receptor selective antagonist <START:Chemical> RP 67 , 580 <END> and the NK 2 receptor selective antagonist <START:Chemical> SR 48 , 968 <END> , given intra - arterially , suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK 1 and NK 2 receptors .
Intra - arterially given <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the <START:Chemical> PG <END> had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle .
The effect of intra - arterial <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> could not be blocked by intra - arterial <START:Chemical> RP 67 , 580 <END> or <START:Chemical> SR 48 , 968 <END> , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the <START:Chemical> PG <END> was given intravesically .
The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor .
However , when given intravesically , <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> may stimulate micturition by releasing <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .
These <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK 1 and NK 2 receptors .
<START:Chemical> Prostanoids <END> may , via release of <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> , contribute to both urge and <START:Disease> bladder hyperactivity <END> seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract .
Recurrent acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> .
A 14 - year - old girl is reported with recurrent , <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> - induced , acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> .
The second episode was more severe than the first ; and although both were treated with intensive corticosteroid therapy , renal function remained impaired .
Although most cases of antibiotic induced acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> are benign and self - limited , some patients are at risk for permanent <START:Disease> renal injury <END> .
Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> ( <START:Disease> LID <END> ) is among the motor complications that arise in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) patients after a prolonged treatment with <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> .
To this day , transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of <START:Disease> LID <END> [ Neurobiol . Dis . , 17 ( 2004 ) , 219 ] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking .
In the present study , we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> - lesion rat model of <START:Disease> PD <END> treated with saline , <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> or <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> using two - dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry ( MS ) .
Rats treated with <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of <START:Disease> LID <END> .
Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference , 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight MS , atmospheric pressure matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS ( LC / MS / MS ) .
Out of these 67 proteins , <START:Disease> LID <END> significantly changed the expression level of five proteins : alphabeta - crystalin , gamma - enolase , guanidoacetate methyltransferase , vinculin , and proteasome alpha - 2 subunit .
Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach .
In conclusion , this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in <START:Disease> LID <END> .
<START:Disease> Death <END> from chemotherapy in <START:Disease> gestational trophoblastic disease <END> .
Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high - risk stage of <START:Disease> choriocarcinoma <END> .
Based on this principle a 27 - year old woman , classified as being in the high - risk group ( Goldstein and Berkowitz score : 11 ) , was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs .
The multiple drug schema consisted of : <START:Chemical> Etoposide <END> 16 . 213 , <START:Chemical> Methotrexate <END> , <START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> , <START:Chemical> Actomycin - D <END> , and <START:Chemical> Cisplatin <END> .
On the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of <START:Chemical> Methotrexate <END> , <START:Chemical> Etoposide <END> and <START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> were administered .
Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive <START:Disease> pulmonary obstruction <END> due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uterus .
Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive <START:Disease> tumor <END> <START:Disease> necrosis <END> at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of <START:Disease> tumor <END> plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in <START:Disease> tumor <END> tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of <START:Disease> tumor <END> emboli .
In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive <START:Disease> embolism <END> other explanations , such as spontaneous <START:Disease> necrosis <END> , must be considered less likely .
Patients with large <START:Disease> pelvic tumor <END> loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance .
Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug .
Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta - hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics .
Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations .
Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance .
Thus , clinicians should address patients ' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients ' quality of life as well as overall health .
The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics .
Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects , including <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> ( <START:Disease> EPS <END> ) , <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> , sedation , and possible impairment of some cognitive measures , as well as cardiac effects , <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> , hepatic changes , anticholinergic side effects , <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> , and <START:Disease> weight gain <END> .
The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of <START:Disease> EPS <END> , but are associated in varying degrees with sedation , cardiovascular effects , anticholinergic effects , <START:Disease> weight gain <END> , <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> , hepatic effects , lowered <START:Disease> seizure <END> threshold ( primarily <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> ) , and <START:Disease> agranulocytosis <END> ( <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> only ) .
Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals , the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual ' s dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient .
Effect of <START:Chemical> alpha - tocopherol <END> and <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> on <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MA <END> ) - induced dopaminergic <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals .
This study examined the effect of <START:Chemical> alpha - tocopherol <END> ( <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> ) , a scavenger of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species , and <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ) , an <START:Chemical> iron <END> chelator , on the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Male rats were treated with <START:Chemical> MA <END> ( 10 mg / kg , every 2 h for four injections ) .
The rat received either <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> ( 20 mg / kg ) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to <START:Chemical> MA <END> administration or <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ( 50 mg / kg ) subcutaneously 30 min before <START:Chemical> MA <END> administration .
The concentrations of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) , <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> and their metabolites decreased significantly after <START:Chemical> MA <END> administration , which was inhibited by the <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> pretreatment .
<START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> attenuated the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity .
The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> concentration was lower in the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - treated rats .
These changes were significantly attenuated by <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> .
This suggests that <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ameliorate the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - induced <START:Disease> neuronal damage <END> by decreasing the level of oxidative stress .
Prenatal protein deprivation alters <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor binding .
Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
We report that prenatally protein deprived ( PD ) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> and an increased locomotor response to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> in adulthood .
These differences were not observed during puberty .
No changes in <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> or <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> - induced locomotion were seen following PD .
In addition , PD female rats showed increased ( 3 ) <START:Chemical> H <END> - <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> binding in the striatum and hippocampus , but not in the cortex .
PD female rats also showed increased ( 3 ) <START:Chemical> H <END> - <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> binding and decreased <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> transporter binding in striatum .
No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased ( 3 ) <START:Chemical> H <END> - <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> binding in cortex .
This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal <START:Disease> nutritional deficiency <END> enhances risk for <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse .
<START:Chemical> NO <END> - induced <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack : strong increase in plasma <START:Chemical> calcitonin gene - related peptide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> ) concentration and negative correlation with platelet <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> release .
The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma <START:Chemical> calcitonin gene - related peptide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> ) concentration and platelet <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytriptamine <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ) content during the immediate <START:Disease> headache <END> and the delayed genuine <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack provoked by <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> .
Fifteen female <START:Disease> migraineurs ( without aura ) <END> and eight controls participated in the study .
Sublingual <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> ( 0 . 5 mg ) was administered .
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times : 60 min before and after the <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) .
In those subjects who had no <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was used .
Plasma <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> concentration increased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) during the <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the <START:Disease> migraine <END> .
In addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with <START:Disease> migraine <END> <START:Disease> headache <END> intensity ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
However , plasma <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> concentrations failed to change during immediate <START:Disease> headache <END> and in the subjects with no <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack .
Basal <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> concentration was significantly higher and platelet <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack .
Platelet <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> content decreased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) after <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> in subjects with no <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack .
In conclusion , the fact that plasma <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a <START:Disease> migraine <END> <START:Disease> headache <END> suggests a direct relationship between <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> and <START:Disease> migraine <END> .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> release from platelets does not provoke <START:Disease> migraine <END> , it may even counteract the <START:Disease> headache <END> and the concomitant <START:Chemical> CGRP <END> release in this model .
<START:Chemical> Clonidine <END> for <START:Disease> attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder <END> : II . ECG changes and adverse events analysis .
OBJECTIVE : To examine the safety and tolerability of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> used alone or with <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> in children with <START:Disease> attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder <END> ( <START:Disease> ADHD <END> ) .
METHOD : In a 16 - week multicenter , double - blind trial , 122 children with <START:Disease> ADHD <END> were randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ( n = 31 ) , <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> ( n = 29 ) , <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> and <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> ( n = 32 ) , or placebo ( n = 30 ) .
Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0 . 6 mg / day for <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> and 60 mg / day for <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> ( both with divided dosing ) .
Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs .
RESULTS : There were more incidents of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> in subjects treated with <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> compared with those not treated with <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ( 17 . 5 % versus 3 . 4 % ; p = . 02 ) , but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes .
There were no suggestions of interactions between <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> and <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> regarding cardiovascular outcomes .
Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ( 79 . 4 % versus 49 . 2 % ; p = . 0006 ) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal .
<START:Disease> Drowsiness <END> was common on <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Clonidine <END> , used alone or with <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> , appears safe and well tolerated in childhood <START:Disease> ADHD <END> .
Physicians prescribing <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> should monitor for <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial <START:Disease> drowsiness <END> .
<START:Disease> Sexual dysfunction <END> among patients with <START:Disease> arthritis <END> .
The relationship of <START:Disease> arthritis <END> and <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> was investigated among 169 patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> spondyloarthropathy <END> , 130 of whom were pair - matched to controls .
Assessments of marital happiness and <START:Disease> depressed mood <END> were also made using the CES - D and the Azrin Marital Happiness Scale ( AMHS ) .
<START:Disease> Sexual dysfunctions <END> were found to be common among patients and controls , the majority in both groups reporting one or more dysfunctions .
<START:Disease> Impotence <END> was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co - morbidity and the taking of <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> .
<START:Disease> Depressed mood <END> was more common among patients and was associated with certain sexual difficulties , but not with <START:Disease> impotence <END> .
Marital unhappiness , as indicated by AMHS scores , was not associated with <START:Disease> arthritis <END> but was associated with <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> , sexual dissatisfaction and being female .
<START:Chemical> Chloroquine <END> related complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> with <START:Disease> blindness <END> : case report .
A 27 - year old African woman with history of regular <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> ingestion presented with progressive <START:Disease> deterioration of vision <END> , easy <START:Disease> fatiguability <END> , <START:Disease> dyspnoea <END> , <START:Disease> dizziness <END> progressing to <START:Disease> syncopal attacks <END> .
Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> <START:Disease> retinopathy <END> , cardiac assessment revealed features of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> and a complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> with <START:Disease> right bundle branch block <END> pattern .
The <START:Disease> heart block <END> was treated by pacemaker insertion and the <START:Disease> heart failure <END> resolved spontaneously following <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> discontinuation .
She however remains <START:Disease> blind <END> .
<START:Chemical> Oral contraceptives <END> and the risk of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
BACKGROUND : An association between the use of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> and the risk of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> has been found in some , but not all , studies .
We investigated this association , according to the type of <START:Chemical> progestagen <END> included in third - generation ( i . e . , <START:Chemical> desogestrel <END> or <START:Chemical> gestodene <END> ) and second - generation ( i . e . ,
<START:Chemical> levonorgestrel <END> ) <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> , the dose of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> , and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS : In a nationwide , population - based , case - control study , we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> and who were matched for age , calendar year of the index event , and area of residence .
Subjects supplied information on <START:Chemical> oral - contraceptive <END> use and major cardiovascular risk factors .
An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G 20210 A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS : The odds ratio for <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> among women who used any type of combined <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> , as compared with nonusers , was 2 . 0 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 2 . 8 ) .
The adjusted odds ratio was 2 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 4 . 1 ) among women who used second - generation <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> and 1 . 3 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 7 to 2 . 5 ) among those who used third - generation <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
Among women who used <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> , the odds ratio was 2 . 1 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 ) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1 . 9 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 6 to 5 . 5 )
for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS : The risk of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> was increased among women who used second - generation <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
The results with respect to the use of third - generation <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second - generation <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
The risk of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> was similar among women who used <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation .
Assessment of perinatal <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> prevention practices in New Hampshire .
METHODS : Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother - infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire ' s 25 delivery hospitals .
Assessment was done on the following : prenatal screening for <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> , administration of the <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> vaccine birth dose to all infants , administration of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin to infants who were born to <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> - positive mothers , <START:Disease> rubella <END> immunity , and administration of in - hospital postpartum <START:Disease> rubella <END> vaccine to <START:Disease> rubella <END> nonimmune women .
RESULTS : Prenatal screening rates for <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> ( 98 . 8 % ) and <START:Disease> rubella <END> ( 99 . 4 % ) were high .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> vaccine birth dose was administered to 76 . 2 % of all infants .
All infants who were born to <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> - positive mothers also received <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin .
Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> vaccination .
The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 ( 48 . 5 % and 67 . 5 % , respectively ) was less than any other months , whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 ( 88 . 2 % ) was the highest .
Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of <START:Disease> rubella <END> nonimmunity ( 9 . 5 % ) .
In - hospital postpartum <START:Disease> rubella <END> vaccine administration was documented for 75 . 6 % of nonimmune women .
CONCLUSION : This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire ' s birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement .
Persistent <START:Disease> paralysis <END> after prolonged use of <START:Chemical> atracurium <END> in the absence of corticosteroids .
Neuromuscular blocking agents ( NMBAs ) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation .
Reports of persistent <START:Disease> paralysis <END> after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid - based NMBAs such as <START:Chemical> vecuronium bromide <END> , especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids .
<START:Chemical> Atracurium besylate <END> , a short - acting <START:Chemical> benzylisoquinolinium <END> NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function , has also been associated with persistent <START:Disease> paralysis <END> , but only when used with corticosteroids .
We report a case of <START:Chemical> atracurium <END> - related <START:Disease> paralysis <END> persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids .
Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross - react with <START:Chemical> halothane <END> - induced antibodies .
Two halogenated anesthetics , <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> , have been associated with an allergic - type <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> both alone and following previous exposure to <START:Chemical> halothane <END> .
<START:Chemical> Halothane <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> appears to involve an aberrant immune response .
An antibody response to a protein - bound biotransformation product ( <START:Chemical> trifluoroacetyl <END> adduct ) has been detected on <START:Chemical> halothane <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> patients .
This study was performed to determine cross - reactivity between <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> with the <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> halothane <END> .
The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by <START:Chemical> halothane <END> - induced antibodies following <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> , and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models .
<START:Chemical> Enflurane <END> administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver .
In the same liver , biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20 - fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats .
This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and / or <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> could produce a <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> condition similar to that of <START:Chemical> halothane <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> either alone or subsequent to <START:Chemical> halothane <END> administration .
The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens .
Reduced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome - encapsulated <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> compared with conventional <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in a randomized , multicenter trial of metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
PURPOSE : To determine whether <START:Chemical> Myocet <END> ( liposome - encapsulated <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ; The Liposome Company , Elan Corporation , Princeton , NJ ) in combination with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> significantly reduces <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first - line treatment of metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> ( <START:Disease> MBC <END> ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Two hundred ninety - seven patients with <START:Disease> MBC <END> and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg / m ( 2 ) of <START:Chemical> Myocet <END> ( M ) or conventional <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( A ) , in combination with 600 mg / m ( 2 ) of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( C ) , every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxicity <END> was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction , assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans , or <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) .
Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective <START:Disease> tumor <END> response rates ( World Health Organization criteria ) , time to progression , and survival .
RESULTS : Six percent of MC patients versus 21 % ( including five cases of <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) of AC patients developed <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> ( P = . 0002 ) .
Median cumulative <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> dose at onset was more than 2 , 220 mg / m ( 2 ) for MC versus 480 mg / m ( 2 ) for AC ( P = . 0001 , hazard ratio , 5 . 04 ) .
MC patients also experienced less grade 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> .
Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable : objective response rates , 43 % versus 43 % ; median time to progression , 5 . 1 % versus 5 . 5 months ; median time to treatment failure , 4 . 6 versus 4 . 4 months ; and median survival , 19 versus 16 months .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Myocet <END> improves the therapeutic index of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> by significantly reducing <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and grade 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> and provides comparable antitumor efficacy , when used in combination with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> as first - line therapy for <START:Disease> MBC <END> .
Protective effects of antithrombin on <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> in rats .
We investigated the effects of antithrombin , a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors , in rats with <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> , which is an experimental model of human <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Antithrombin ( 50 or 500 IU / kg / i . v . ) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( 50 mg / kg / i . v . ) .
Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hematological abnormalities <END> .
<START:Chemical> Puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> and <START:Disease> hyperlipidemia <END> were also suppressed .
Histopathological examination revealed severe <START:Disease> renal damage <END> such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats , while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin - treated rats .
In addition , antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased .
These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> urotensin - II <END> centrally administered in mice .
<START:Chemical> Urotensin - II <END> ( <START:Chemical> U - II <END> ) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system .
Intracerebroventricular ( i . c . v . ) injection of <START:Chemical> U - II <END> causes <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion .
However , the behavioral effects of centrally administered <START:Chemical> U - II <END> have received little attention .
In the present study , we tested the effects of i . c . v . injections of <START:Chemical> U - II <END> on behavioral , metabolic , and endocrine responses in mice .
Administration of graded doses of <START:Chemical> U - II <END> ( 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse ) provoked : ( 1 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole - board test ; ( 2 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black - and - white compartment test , and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus - maze test ; and ( 3 ) a dose - dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced - swimming test and tail suspension test .
Intracerebroventricular injection of <START:Chemical> U - II <END> also caused an increase in : food intake at doses of 100 and 1 , 000 ng / mouse , water intake at doses of 100 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse , and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10 , 000 ng / mouse .
Whatever was the dose , the central administration of <START:Chemical> U - II <END> had no effect on body temperature , nociception , <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> penile erection <END> and climbing behavior , and stress - induced plasma <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> level .
Taken together , the present study demonstrates that the central injection of <START:Chemical> U - II <END> at doses of 1 - 10 , 000 ng / mouse induces anxiogenic - and depressant - like effects in mouse .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> U - II <END> may be involved in some aspects of <START:Disease> psychiatric disorders <END> .
A phase I clinical study of the <START:Chemical> antipurine <END> antifolate <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> ( <START:Chemical> DDATHF <END> ) given with oral <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lometrexol <END> is an antifolate which inhibits <START:Chemical> glycinamide ribonucleotide <END> formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , an enzyme essential for de novo <START:Chemical> purine <END> synthesis .
Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> has activity against <START:Disease> tumours <END> which are refractory to other drugs , notably <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> .
However , the initial clinical development of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative <START:Disease> toxicities <END> .
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> can be prevented by low dose <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> administration , i . e . for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose .
This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> given with <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> supplementation which has confirmed that the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> can be markedly reduced by <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> supplementation .
<START:Disease> Thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:Disease> mucositis <END> were the major <START:Disease> toxicities <END> .
There was no clear relationship between clinical <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and the extent of plasma <START:Chemical> folate <END> elevation .
Associated studies demonstrated that <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce <START:Disease> toxicity <END> by enhancing <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> plasma clearance .
The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor .
This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in <START:Disease> cancer <END> therapy .
Combined antiretroviral therapy causes <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> and elevates plasma <START:Chemical> lactate <END> in transgenic <START:Disease> AIDS <END> mice .
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) is implicated in <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> CM <END> ) and in elevated plasma <START:Chemical> lactate <END> ( <START:Chemical> LA <END> ) in <START:Disease> AIDS <END> through mechanisms of <START:Disease> mitochondrial dysfunction <END> .
To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo , 8 - week - old hemizygous transgenic <START:Disease> AIDS <END> mice ( NL 4 - 3 Delta gag / pol ; TG ) and wild - type FVB / n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> , <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> , and <START:Chemical> indinavir <END> or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days .
At termination of the experiments , mice underwent echocardiography , quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of <START:Disease> CM <END> ( ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ ANF ] and sarcoplasmic <START:Chemical> calcium <END> ATPase [ SERCA 2 ] ) , and determination of plasma <START:Chemical> LA <END> .
Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy .
After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort , left ventricular mass increased 160 % by echocardiography .
Molecularly , ANF mRNA increased 250 % and SERCA 2 mRNA decreased 57 % .
Biochemically , <START:Chemical> LA <END> was elevated ( 8 . 5 + / - 2 . 0 mM ) .
Pathologically , granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes , indicating enlarged , damaged mitochondria .
Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally .
No changes were found in other cohorts .
After 10 days , only ANF was elevated , and only in the TG + HAART cohort .
Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial <START:Disease> CM <END> with elevated <START:Chemical> LA <END> in <START:Disease> AIDS <END> transgenic mice .
Fatal <START:Disease> intracranial bleeding <END> associated with prehospital use of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> .
We present a case of paramedic misjudgment in the execution of a protocol for the treatment of <START:Disease> allergic reaction <END> in a case of <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> with <START:Disease> wheezing <END> .
The sudden onset of <START:Disease> respiratory distress <END> , <START:Disease> rash <END> , and a history of a new medicine led the two paramedics on the scene to administer subcutaneous <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> .
Subsequently , acute <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> and fatal <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> occurred .
<START:Chemical> Epinephrine <END> has a proven role in <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> in prehospital care ; however , use by paramedics in patients with suspected <START:Disease> allergic reaction <END> and severe <START:Disease> hypertension <END> should be viewed with caution .
Late recovery of renal function in a woman with the <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> .
A case is reported of the <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> HUS <END> ) in a woman taking <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
She was treated with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> and hemodialysis ; and after more than three months , her urinary output rose above 500 ml ; and six months after the onset of <START:Disease> anuria <END> , dialysis treatment was stopped .
This case emphasizes the possibility that <START:Disease> HUS <END> in adults is not invariably irreversible and that , despite prolonged <START:Disease> oliguria <END> , recovery of renal function can be obtained .
Therefore , in adult patients affected by <START:Disease> HUS <END> , dialysis should not be discontinued prematurely ; moreover , bilateral nephrectomy , for treatment of severe <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> , should be performed with caution .
Effects of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> on <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Atrial tachycardia <END> - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:Disease> AF <END> ) and decreases L - type <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) current .
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L - type <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote <START:Disease> AF <END> , consistent with an <START:Disease> AF <END> promoting effect of <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) channel inhibition .
METHODS : To evaluate the potential mechanisms of <START:Disease> AF <END> promotion by <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - <START:Chemical> chloralose <END> anesthetized dogs .
<START:Chemical> Diltiazem <END> was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with <START:Chemical> atropine <END> and <START:Chemical> nadolol <END> was applied in some experiments .
Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during <START:Disease> AF <END> .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> caused <START:Disease> AF <END> promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of <START:Disease> AF <END> induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / - S . E . ) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0 . 01 vs . control ) at a loading dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0 . 0005 vs . control ) at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg .
Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> .
In these experiments , <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0 . 02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1 % , P < 0 . 05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of <START:Disease> AF <END> ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms , P < 0 . 005 ) .
<START:Chemical> Diltiazem <END> did not affect ERP , <START:Disease> AF <END> cycle length or <START:Disease> AF <END> duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> ( n = 5 ) .
In the presence of autonomic blockade , <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> failed to promote <START:Disease> AF <END> and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness .
Neither <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> nor <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade .
Epicardial mapping suggested that <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> promoted <START:Disease> AF <END> by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> promotes <START:Disease> AF <END> in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> .
Recurrent reversible <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> from <START:Chemical> amphotericin <END> .
A patient with cryptogenic <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> and disseminated <START:Disease> sporotrichosis <END> developed <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> immediately following the administration of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> on four separate occasions .
The abruptness of the <START:Disease> renal failure <END> and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> .
We propose that <START:Chemical> amphotericin <END> , in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume , may activate tubuloglomerular feedback , thereby contributing to <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
Use of chromosome substitution strains to identify <START:Disease> seizure <END> susceptibility loci in mice .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> susceptibility varies among inbred mouse strains .
Chromosome substitution strains ( CSS ) , in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain ( donor ) has been transferred onto a second strain ( host ) by repeated backcrossing , may be used to identify quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) that contribute to <START:Disease> seizure <END> susceptibility .
QTLs for susceptibility to <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , a model of <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> , have not been reported , and CSS have not previously been used to localize <START:Disease> seizure <END> susceptibility genes .
We report QTLs identified using a B 6 ( host ) x A / J ( donor ) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Three hundred fifty - five adult male CSS mice , 58 B 6 , and 39 A / J were tested for susceptibility to <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice .
B 6 mice were resistant to <START:Disease> seizures <END> and slower to reach stages compared to A / J mice .
The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages , diverging dramatically from the B 6 phenotype .
Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS 10 and CSS 18 mice .
CSS mapping suggests <START:Disease> seizure <END> susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18 .
This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> .
Phase I trial of <START:Chemical> 13 - cis - retinoic acid <END> in children with <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> following bone marrow transplantation .
PURPOSE : Treatment of <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> cell lines with <START:Chemical> 13 - cis - retinoic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> ) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation .
Since <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> has demonstrated clinical responses in <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> patients , it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy .
This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal - tolerated dosage ( MTD ) , <START:Disease> toxicities <END> , and pharmacokinetics of <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> administered on an intermittent schedule in children with <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> following bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifty - one assessable patients , 2 to 12 years of age , were treated with oral <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks , followed by a 2 - week rest period , for up to 12 courses .
The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg / m 2 / d until dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ( DLT ) was observed .
A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted .
RESULTS : The MTD of <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> was 160 mg / m 2 / d .
Dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicities <END> in six of nine patients at 200 mg / m 2 / d included <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> ( n = 3 ) , <START:Disease> rash <END> ( n = 2 ) , and <START:Disease> anemia <END> / <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> / <START:Disease> emesis <END> / <START:Disease> rash <END> ( n = 1 ) .
All <START:Disease> toxicities <END> resolved after <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> was discontinued .
Three complete responses were observed in marrow <START:Disease> metastases <END> .
Serum levels of 7 . 4 + / - 3 . 0 mumol / L ( peak ) and 4 . 0 + / - 2 . 8 mumol / L ( trough ) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy .
The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol / L .
CONCLUSION : The MTD of <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg / m 2 / d .
Serum levels known to be effective against <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> in vitro were achieved at this dose .
The DLT included <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> , and may be predicted by serum <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> levels .
Monitoring of serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> levels is indicated in future trials .
Maternal <START:Chemical> lithium <END> and neonatal <START:Disease> Ebstein ' s anomaly <END> : evaluation with cross - sectional echocardiography .
Cross - sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested <START:Chemical> lithium <END> during pregnancy .
In one infant , <START:Disease> Ebstein ' s anomaly <END> of the tricuspid valve was identified .
In the other infant cross - sectional echocardiography provided reassurance that the infant did not have <START:Disease> Ebstein ' s anomaly <END> .
Cross - sectional echocardiographic screening of newborns exposed to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> during gestation can provide highly accurate , noninvasive assessment of the presence or absence of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac malformations <END> .
Peritubular capillary basement membrane reduplication in allografts and native <START:Disease> kidney disease <END> : a clinicopathologic study of 278 consecutive renal specimens .
BACKGROUND : An association has been found between <START:Disease> transplant glomerulopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> TG <END> ) and reduplication of peritubular capillary basement membranes ( PTCR ) .
Although such an association is of practical and theoretical importance , only one prospective study has tried to confirm it .
METHODS : We examined 278 consecutive renal specimens ( from 135 transplants and 143 native kidneys ) for ultrastructural evidence of PTCR .
In addition to renal allografts with <START:Disease> TG <END> , we also examined grafts with acute rejection , recurrent <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> , <START:Disease> chronic allograft nephropathy <END> and stable grafts ( " protocol biopsies " ) .
Native kidney specimens included a wide range of <START:Disease> glomerulopathies <END> as well as cases of <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> , <START:Disease> malignant hypertension <END> , acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> , and <START:Disease> acute tubular necrosis <END> .
RESULTS : We found PTCR in 14 of 15 cases of <START:Disease> TG <END> , in 7 transplant biopsy specimens without <START:Disease> TG <END> , and in 13 of 143 native kidney biopsy specimens .
These 13 included cases of <START:Disease> malignant hypertension <END> , <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> , <START:Disease> lupus nephritis <END> , <START:Disease> Henoch - Schonlein nephritis <END> , crescentic <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> , and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - related <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
Mild PTCR in allografts without <START:Disease> TG <END> did not predict <START:Disease> renal failure <END> or significant <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> after follow - up periods of between 3 months and 1 year .
CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that in transplants , there is a strong association between well - developed PTCR and <START:Disease> TG <END> , while the significance of mild PTCR and its predictive value in the absence of <START:Disease> TG <END> is unclear .
PTCR also occurs in certain native <START:Disease> kidney diseases <END> , though the association is not as strong as that for <START:Disease> TG <END> .
We suggest that repeated <START:Disease> endothelial injury <END> , including <START:Disease> immunologic injury <END> , may be the cause of this lesion both in allografts and native kidneys .
<START:Chemical> Norepinephrine <END> signaling through beta - adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> anxiety <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties .
While the mechanisms underlying <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> ' s rewarding effects have been studied extensively , less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> , such as <START:Disease> anxiety <END> .
METHODS : In this study , we evaluated the performance of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / - ) mice , which lack <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ( <START:Chemical> NE <END> ) , in the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> anxiety <END> .
RESULTS : We found that <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> dose - dependently increased <START:Disease> anxiety <END> - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / - ) mice , as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration .
The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> anxiety <END> was also attenuated in Dbh + / - mice following administration of <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> , a <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> beta - hydroxylase ( DBH ) inhibitor .
In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists , we found that pretreatment with the beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> blocked <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> anxiety <END> - like behavior in Dbh + / - and wild - type C 57 BL 6 / J mice , while the alpha ( 1 ) antagonist <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> and the alpha ( 2 ) antagonist <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> had no effect .
CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta - adrenergic receptors is required for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> anxiety <END> in mice .
Cholinergic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> resulting from ocular instillation of <START:Chemical> echothiophate iodide <END> eye drops .
A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of <START:Chemical> echothiophate iodide <END> ophthalmic drops , presented with profound <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> and was initially given the diagnosis of <START:Disease> myasthenia gravis <END> .
Red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops .
Differential effects of systemically administered <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> on dynamic and static <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> induced by intradermal <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> in humans .
We have examined the effect of systemic administration of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> on brush - evoked ( dynamic ) <START:Disease> pain <END> and punctate - evoked ( static ) <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> .
In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover study , we studied 12 volunteers in three experiments .
<START:Chemical> Capsaicin <END> 100 micrograms was injected intradermally on the volar forearm followed by an i . v . infusion of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> ( bolus 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 over 10 min followed by infusion of 7 micrograms kg - 1 min - 1 ) , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> 5 mg kg - 1 or saline for 50 min .
Infusion started 15 min after injection of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> .
The following were measured : spontaneous <START:Disease> pain <END> , <START:Disease> pain <END> evoked by punctate and brush stimuli ( VAS ) , and areas of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> reduced both the area of brush - evoked and punctate - evoked <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> significantly and it tended to reduce brush - evoked <START:Disease> pain <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lidocaine <END> reduced the area of punctate - evoked <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> significantly .
It tended to reduce VAS scores of spontaneous <START:Disease> pain <END> but had no effect on evoked <START:Disease> pain <END> .
The differential effects of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> on static and dynamic <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> suggest that the two types of <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> are mediated by separate mechanisms and have a distinct pharmacology .
Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy .
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs and <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> LID <END> ) .
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> responsiveness of motor signs and the <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations ) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery , whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in <START:Disease> LID <END> .
We also found a highly significant correlation ( P : < 0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in <START:Disease> LID <END> in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs .
The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> or <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs .
The differential predictive value of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> responsiveness for the outcome of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs and <START:Disease> LID <END> and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> and <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> , the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of <START:Disease> LID <END> .
We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy .
The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms , and hence could be variable .
Electro - oculography , electroretinography , visual evoked potentials , and multifocal electroretinography in patients with <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> - attributed <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> .
PURPOSE : Symptomatic <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> thought to be associated with <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> has been reported .
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> - attributed <START:Disease> visual field loss <END> , three of whom were reported previously .
Six of the patients were no longer receiving <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> .
METHODS : The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer .
Full visual electrophysiology , including flash electroretinography ( ERG ) , pattern electroretinography , multifocal ERG using the VERIS system , electro - oculography , and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials , was undertaken .
RESULTS : Seven patients showed marked <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> with some sparing of the temporal visual field .
The eighth exhibited concentric constriction .
Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits ; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices ; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave .
However , five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves , and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials .
Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level .
CONCLUSION : Marked <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> appears to be associated with <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> therapy .
The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> therapy is withdrawn .
Use of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> for the prevention of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
AIM : <START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> ( <START:Disease> HC <END> ) is a limiting side - effect of chemotherapy with <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> IFS <END> ) .
In the study presented here , we investigated the use of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> for the prevention of <START:Chemical> IFS <END> - induced <START:Disease> HC <END> .
METHODS : Male Wistar rats ( 150 - 200 g ; 6 rats per group ) were treated with saline or <START:Chemical> mesna <END> 5 min ( i . p . ) before and 2 and 6 h after ( v . o . ) administration of <START:Chemical> IFS <END> .
One , two or three doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> were replaced with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> alone or with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> plus <START:Chemical> mesna <END> .
<START:Disease> Cystitis <END> was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis .
RESULTS : The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by <START:Chemical> IFS <END> by 84 . 79 % and 89 . 13 % , respectively .
In addition , it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by <START:Chemical> IFS <END> .
Moreover , the addition of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> to the last two doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> was more efficient than three doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> alone when evaluated microscopically .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> was efficient in blocking <START:Chemical> IFS <END> - induced <START:Disease> HC <END> .
However , the replacement of last two doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> with saline or all of the <START:Chemical> mesna <END> doses with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> did not prevent <START:Disease> HC <END> .
<START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> .
<START:Disease> Localized scleroderma <END> has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children .
There is no accepted or proven treatment for <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> .
Case reports of 11 patients with severe , extensive <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> who were treated with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> are summarized in this article .
This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 ( 64 % ) of 11 patients .
Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients , skin softening in 5 , and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children .
Joint stiffness and <START:Disease> contractures <END> also improved .
The dose of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg / kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months .
<START:Chemical> D - Penicillamine <END> caused <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> in 1 patient and milder reversible <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in 3 other patients ; none developed <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> may be effective in severe cases of <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> .
A murine model of <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> : the effects of <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> fluoxetine hydrochloride <END> , a selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor , on <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> induction in Wistar albino rats .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to investigate whether <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> and its effects with respect to <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> .
DESIGN : <START:Chemical> Fluoxetine <END> , a <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor , was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls .
Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days .
SETTING : Marmara University School of Medicine , Department of Histology and Embryology , Zeynep Kamil Women and Children ' s Hospital .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serum prolactin levels , uterine histopathology .
RESULTS : The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups .
Histological studies revealed 11 cases of <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> , all within the noncastrated group receiving <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> .
CONCLUSION : It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian <START:Chemical> steroids <END> that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma .
This invasion eventually progresses to <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> .
Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> and in bone marrow endothelial cells .
<START:Chemical> Azidothymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF - IL - 3 ( fusion protein of insulin - like growth factor II ( IGF II ) and interleukin 3 ) .
Although interleukin 3 ( IL - 3 ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro , injection of IGF - IL - 3 and EPO in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF - IL - 3 or EPO alone .
We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL - 3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells .
Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF - IL - 3 .
There was a significant reduction of <START:Chemical> thymidine <END> incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre - treated with IGF - IL - 3 and EPO .
Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL - 3 significantly reduced <START:Chemical> thymidine <END> incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone .
These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL - 3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production .
Central <START:Disease> vein thrombosis <END> and topical <START:Chemical> dipivalyl epinephrine <END> .
A report is given on an 83 - year - old female who acquired central <START:Disease> vein thrombosis <END> in her seeing eye one day after having started topical medication with <START:Chemical> dipivalyl epinephrine <END> for advanced <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> discovered in the other eye .
From present knowledge about the effects of adrenergic eye drops on ocular blood circulation , it is difficult to suggest an association between the two events , which may be coincidental only .
Treatment of <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> with <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Azathioprine <END> treatment benefited 19 ( 66 % ) out of 29 patients suffering from severe <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> .
Haematological complications were not troublesome and results of biochemical liver function tests remained normal .
Minimal <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> was seen in two cases and portal <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> of a reversible degree in eight .
Liver biopsies should be undertaken at regular intervals if <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> therapy is continued so that structural <START:Disease> liver damage <END> may be detected at an early and reversible stage .
Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> in adult emergency department <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients .
METHODS : This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation .
Plasma was tested for <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> and the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> metabolite <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> using enzyme - mediated immunoassay methodology .
Plasma samples with <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> greater than 150 ng / mL or an <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> greater than 500 ng / mL were defined as positive .
Patient demographics , history of underlying drug or <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - related <START:Disease> seizure <END> disorder , estimated time from <START:Disease> seizure <END> to sample collection , history or suspicion of <START:Disease> cocaine or amphetamine abuse <END> , results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers .
RESULTS : Fourteen of 248 ( 5 . 6 % , 95 % CI 2 . 7 % - 8 . 5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % CI 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of <START:Disease> cocaine or amphetamine abuse <END> ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : During this study period , routine plasma screening for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> amphetamines <END> in adult <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients had a low yield .
As a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of <START:Disease> drug abuse <END> in this population .
Adverse interaction between <START:Chemical> beta - adrenergic blocking drugs <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> -- report of three cases .
Three patients with <START:Disease> ischaemic heart disease <END> developed profound <START:Disease> cardiac failure <END> , <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> during combined therapy with <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> and <START:Chemical> beta - adrenergic blocking drugs <END> .
This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy .
Baseline left ventricular function , assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography , was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other .
Simultaneously administration of <START:Chemical> beta - adrenergic blocking drugs <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution .
<START:Disease> Orthostatic hypotension <END> occurs following alpha 2 - adrenoceptor blockade in chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> - pretreated conscious spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
1 . Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment alters the alpha 2 - adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats ( SHR ) .
2 .
Conscious SHR ( male 300 - 350 g ) were subjected to 90 degrees head - up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) or <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( 3 mg kg - 1 i . v . ) .
<START:Disease> Orthostatic hypotension <END> was determined by the average decrease ( % ) in mean arterial pressure ( MAP femoral ) over the 60 - s tilt period .
The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( - 23 % ( - ) - 26 % MAP ) and <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( - 16 % ( - ) - 33 % MAP ) .
However , the head - up tilt induced <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> in the SHR treated with <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( - 16 % MAP , n = 6 ) , but not in the SHR treated with <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( less than + 2 % MAP , n = 6 ) .
3 .
Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> at 2 mg kg - 1 day - 1 i . p . for chronic alpha 1 - adrenoceptor blockade .
MAP in conscious SHR after chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment was 14 % lower than in the untreated SHR ( n = 8 ) .
Head - up tilts in these rats did not produce <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) .
Conversely , administration of <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( 3 mg kg - 1 i . v . ) in chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12 - 31 % ( n = 4 ) , and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19 - 23 % in these rats .
4 . The pressor responses and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> to the alpha 1 - agonist <START:Chemical> cirazoline <END> ( 0 . 6 and 2 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) , the alpha 2 - agonist <START:Chemical> Abbott - 53693 <END> ( 1 and 3 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) , and <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> ( 0 . 1 and 1 . 0 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> pretreatment .
Both the pressor and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> effects of <START:Chemical> cirazoline <END> were abolished in chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treated SHR ( n = 4 ) as compared to the untreated SHR ( n = 4 ) .
On the other hand , the pressor effects of <START:Chemical> Abbott - 53693 <END> were similar in both groups of SHR , but the accompanying <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was greater in SHR with chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment than without such treatment .
Furthermore , the <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> that accompanied the <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> - induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment despite a 47 - 71 % reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1 - receptor blocked SHR .

Value of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> in prevention of the <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> - <START:Disease> myalgia <END> syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> : a double blind randomized trial .
The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion ( TDI ) of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> has been well documented .
In 40 % of treated patients , an <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> - <START:Disease> myalgia <END> syndrome develops .
The purpose of this randomized , double - blind , prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous ( i . v . ) administration of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> MP <END> ) prevents this complication .
Sixty - five patients , 34 women and 31 men , ages 36 to 80 years , received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1 ) , 125 mg i . v . <START:Chemical> MP <END> before and saline after TDI ( group 2 ) , or 125 mg i . v . <START:Chemical> MP <END> before and after TDI ( group 3 ) .
Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity .
Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients , 33 % of group 2 , and 26 % of group 3 had reactions to TDI .
The severity of reactions ( minimal , mild , and moderate , respectively ) was as follows : group 1 -- 6 , 6 , and 2 ; group 2 -- 1 , 5 , and 0 ; group 3 -- 5 , 1 , and 0 .
Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher ' s exact test using 95 % confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf .
These data demonstrate that administration of <START:Chemical> MP <END> before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> - <START:Disease> myalgia <END> syndrome .
We conclude that 125 mg i . v . <START:Chemical> MP <END> should be given routinely before and after TDI of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> .
Reverse or inverted <START:Disease> left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome <END> ( reverse <START:Disease> Takotsubo cardiomyopathy <END> ) in a young woman in the setting of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use .
Transient <START:Disease> left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome <END> was first described in Japan as " <START:Disease> Takotsubo cardiomyopathy <END> . "
This syndrome has been identified in many other countries .
Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature .
One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome , with hyperdynamic apex and complete <START:Disease> akinesia <END> of the base ( as opposed to the classic <START:Disease> apical ballooning <END> ) .
In this article , we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse <START:Disease> apical ballooning syndrome <END> occurring after <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use .
This report is followed by review of the literature .
Neuroplasticity of the adult primate auditory cortex following cochlear <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> .
Tonotopic organization is an essential feature of the primary auditory area ( A 1 ) of primate cortex .
In A 1 of macaque monkeys , low frequencies are represented rostrolaterally and high frequencies are represented caudomedially .
The purpose of this study was to determine if changes occur in this tonotopic organization following cochlear <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> .
Under anesthesia , the superior temporal gyrus of adult macaque monkeys was exposed , and the tonotopic organization of A 1 was mapped using conventional microelectrode recording techniques .
Following recovery , the monkeys were selectively deafened for high frequencies using <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> .
The actual frequencies deafened were determined by the loss of tone - burst elicited auditory brainstem responses .
Three months after deafening , A 1 was remapped .
Postmortem cytoarchitectural features identifying A 1 were correlated with the electrophysiologic data .
The results indicate that the deprived area of A 1 undergoes extensive reorganization and becomes responsive to intact cochlear frequencies .
The region of cortex that represents the low frequencies was not obviously affected by the cochlear <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> after <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> administration in a pediatric patient .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> is a <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> receptor antagonist used to reverse sedation and <START:Disease> respiratory depression <END> induced by <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> have complicated its use in adult patients .
<START:Disease> Overdose <END> patients who have coingested tricyclic antidepressants have a higher risk of these complications .
Little information exists concerning adverse effects of <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> in children .
We report the occurrence of a generalized <START:Disease> tonic - clonic seizure <END> in a pediatric patient following the administration of <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> .
Adverse effect of the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> on <START:Disease> nephrosclerosis <END> in rats with <START:Disease> renovascular hypertension <END> .
The effect of a 6 - week treatment with the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> or the <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> converting enzyme inhibitor <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> on blood pressure , <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> , renal hemodynamics , and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two - kidney , one clip <START:Disease> renovascular hypertension <END> .
Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery , <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats ( 178 + / - 4 mm Hg ) were randomly assigned to three groups : untreated <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> controls ( n = 8 ) , <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> - treated ( n = 8 ) , or <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> - treated ( n = 10 ) .
Sham - operated rats served as normotensive controls ( 128 + / - 3 mm Hg , n = 8 ) .
After 6 weeks of treatment , renal hemodynamics ( glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow ) were measured in the anesthetized rats .
Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis .
<START:Chemical> Enalapril <END> but not <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> reduced blood pressure significantly .
After 6 weeks of therapy , glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups .
Renal plasma flow increased , but albumin excretion and <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> did not change after <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> treatment .
In contrast , in the <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> - treated group <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> increased from 12 . 8 + / - 2 progressively to 163 + / - 55 compared with 19 . 2 + / - 9 mg / 24 hr in the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> controls .
Furthermore , <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> index was significantly increased in the <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> - treated group compared with the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> controls ( 0 . 38 + / - 0 . 1 versus 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 04 ) .
In addition , glomerular size was higher in the <START:Chemical> nitrendipine <END> - treated group ( 14 . 9 + / - 0 . 17 10 ( - 3 ) mm 2 ) but lower in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> - treated group ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 15 10 ( - 3 ) mm 2 ) compared with the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> controls ( 12 . 1 + / - 0 . 17 10 ( - 3 ) mm 2 ) .

<START:Chemical> Midazolam <END> compared with <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> as an induction agent .
In patients premedicated with <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> + <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( + 5 mg <START:Chemical> nitrazepam <END> the evening before surgery ) , the sleep - inducing effect of <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> 0 . 15 mg / kg i . v . was clearly slower in onset than that of <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> 4 . 67 mg / kg i . v . Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group , but , although <START:Disease> apnoea <END> occurred less often in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group it lasted longer .
On the whole , the differences between <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> and <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> had no apparent clinical consequences .
<START:Chemical> Midazolam <END> is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia .
Factors associated with <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and clinical outcome in patients receiving <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> .
Data from 60 patients treated with <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> were analyzed for factors associated with <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
In 42 of these patients , data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome .
Variables evaluated included patient weight , age , sex , serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> level , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance , duration of therapy , total dose , mean daily dose , organism minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , mean peak levels , mean trough levels , mean area under the serum concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , total AUC , mean AUC greater than MIC , total AUC greater than MIC , mean Schumacher ' s intensity factor ( IF ) , total IF , In ( mean maximum concentration [ Cmax ] / MIC ) .
Model - dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one - compartment model .
When the parameters were examined individually , duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
In contrast , a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy ( P less than . 001 ) as an important factor .
Based on this model and on Bayes ' theorem , the predictive accuracy of identifying " <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> " patients increased from 0 . 17 to 0 . 39 .
When examined individually , mean IF , MIC , total dose , mean daily dose , and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with cure .
In contrast , a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF , MIC , and total dose according to one model and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) according to a second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value .
Based on Bayes ' theorem and the first model , the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 83 .
For the second model , the predictive accuracy increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 50 . ( ABSTRACT

<START:Chemical> Perhexiline maleate <END> and <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Peripheral neuropathy <END> has been noted as a complication of therapy with <START:Chemical> perhexiline maleate <END> , a drug widely used in France ( and in clinical trials in the United States ) for the prophylactic treatment of <START:Disease> angina pectoris <END> .
In 24 patients with this complication , the marked slowing of motor nerve conduction velocity and the electromyographic changes imply mainly a <START:Disease> demyelinating disorder <END> .
Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy .
In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis , with only slight improvement .
The underlying mechanism causing the <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> is not yet fully known , although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process .
Time dependence of plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> , and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> during incomplete <START:Disease> cerebral ischemia <END> in the rat .
Incomplete <START:Disease> cerebral ischemia <END> ( 30 min ) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries .
Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times ( once every 5 min ) before <START:Disease> ischemia <END> ( 0 time ) and 5 , 15 , and 30 min after <START:Disease> ischemia <END> .
Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high - performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> , and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> .
During <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , a time - dependent increase of plasma <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> was observed .
Plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , which was present in minimal amount at zero time ( 0 . 058 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 015 ) , increased after 5 min of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion ( 0 . 298 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 078 ) .
Increased plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model , one receiving 20 mg / kg b . w . of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylate <END> intravenously immediately before <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , the other receiving 650 micrograms / kg b . w . of the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> drug <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> at a flow rate of 103 microliters / min intravenously during <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , although in this latter group <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> was significantly higher .
The present data indicate that the determination of <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> , and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> in peripheral blood , may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during <START:Disease> ischemic <END> phenomena .

Improvement of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> by <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
Seven patients suffering from <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) with severely disabling <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> received low - dose <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> as an adjunct to the currently used medical treatment .
There was a significant 40 % improvement in the <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> score without increase of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> <START:Disease> motor disability <END> .
Ballistic and choreic <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> were markedly ameliorated , whereas <START:Disease> dystonia <END> was not .
This study suggests that administration of low doses of beta - blockers may improve <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced ballistic and choreic <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> in <START:Disease> PD <END> .
Survey of complications of <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> angiography in Japan .
PURPOSE : We evaluated the safety of <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> for use in fundus angiography .
METHODS : We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> to 32 institutions in Japan , which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company , which manufactures the <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> fundus camera .
RESULTS : Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded , reporting a total of 3 , 774 <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> angiograms performed on 2 , 820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992 .
Before angiography , intradermal or intravenous <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> testing , or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions .
For three patients , the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing .
The dosage of <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg , depending upon the institution .
There were 13 cases of adverse reactions ( 0 . 34 % ) , ten of which were mild reactions such as <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> exanthema <END> , <START:Disease> urtication <END> , <START:Disease> itchiness <END> , and urgency to defecate , and did not require treatment .
Also recorded were one case of <START:Disease> pain <END> of the vein , which required treatment , and two cases of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The two <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> patients required treatment for <START:Disease> shock <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to <START:Chemical> fluorescein sodium <END> indicated that <START:Chemical> indocyanine green <END> is a safe as <START:Chemical> fluorescein <END> for use in angiography .
Treatment of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - related adverse effects by conversion to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> in liver transplant recipients .
When <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> side effects persist despite dose reduction , conversion to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> - based immunosuppression ( CyA ) is necessary .
We characterized <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug , and outcomes after conversion .
Of 388 liver recipients who received <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> as primary immunosuppression , 70 required conversion to CyA .
We recorded indication for conversion , whether conversion was early or late after transplantation , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> dose and trough blood level at conversion , and incidence of rejection after conversion .
Conversion was early in 29 patients ( 41 . 4 % ) and late in 41 ( 58 . 6 % ) .
Indications for early conversion were <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> ( 20 ) , <START:Disease> ( insulin - dependent ) diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:Disease> IDDM <END> ) ( 5 ) , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 3 ) , <START:Disease> gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity <END> ( 6 ) , and <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( 1 ) , and for late conversion were <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> ( 15 ) , <START:Disease> IDDM <END> ( 12 ) , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 3 ) , <START:Disease> GI toxicity <END> ( 5 ) , <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> ( 6 ) , <START:Disease> post - transplant lmphoproliferate disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PTLD <END> ) ( 2 ) , <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( 1 ) , <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> ( 1 ) , and <START:Disease> pruritus <END> ( 1 ) .
All early - conversion patients showed improvement / resolution of symptoms .
Among late - conversion patients , 37 ( 90 . 2 % ) had improvement / resolution ; in 4 ( 9 . 8 % ) , adverse effects persisted .
The overall rejection rate was 30 % .
Sixty - two patients ( 88 . 6 % ) are alive with functioning grafts 686 + / - 362 days ( range , 154 - 1433 days ) after conversion .
When <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction , conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely , with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long - term outcome .
Photodistributed <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> - induced facial <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> .
Five months after starting <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Adalat <END> ) , two patients developed photodistributed facial <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> , which became more noticeable with time .
Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or <START:Disease> flushing <END> .
Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug .
One commenced the closely related drug <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> 3 years later , with recurrence of <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> .
The photodistribution of the <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> suggests a significant drug / light interaction .
Prolonged <START:Disease> paralysis <END> due to <START:Chemical> nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents <END> and <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
The long - term use of <START:Chemical> nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents <END> ( <START:Chemical> ND - NMBA <END> ) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> , although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear .
We report 3 patients ( age 37 - 52 years ) with acute <START:Disease> respiratory insufficiency <END> who developed prolonged <START:Disease> weakness <END> following the discontinuation of <START:Chemical> ND - NMBAs <END> .
Two patients also received intravenous <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients , and all had <START:Disease> acidosis <END> .
Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials , normal sensory studies , and fibrillations .
Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients .
The serum <START:Chemical> vecuronium <END> level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng / mL .
A muscle biopsy in this patient showed <START:Disease> loss of thick , myosin filaments <END> .
The <START:Disease> weakness <END> in these patients is due to <START:Disease> pathology at both the neuromuscular junction <END> ( most likely due to <START:Chemical> ND - NMBA <END> ) and muscle ( most likely due to <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Hepatic dysfunction <END> and <START:Disease> acidosis <END> are contributing risk factors .
<START:Disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B - cell <START:Disease> gastric lymphoma <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> myotonic dystrophy <END> ( <START:Disease> Steinert ' s disease <END> ) .
The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B - cell <START:Disease> gastric lymphoma <END> and <START:Disease> myotonic dystrophy <END> , the most common form of adult <START:Disease> muscular dystrophy <END> , and sudden <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> following one cycle of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - based chemotherapy in the same patient .
<START:Disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> or other <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy .
The <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> in the predisposed myocardium of this patient .
A novel compound , <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> , attenuates <START:Disease> cognitive deficits <END> and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo <START:Disease> dementia <END> models .
To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection , we newly synthesized <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> by the esterification of <START:Chemical> maltol <END> and <START:Chemical> p - coumaric acid <END> .
In the present study , we investigated whether <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> could improve <START:Disease> cognitive decline <END> in <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - injected rats and in <START:Chemical> amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) <END> - infused rats .
<START:Chemical> Maltolyl p - coumarate <END> was found to attenuate <START:Disease> cognitive deficits <END> in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the <START:Chemical> amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) <END> - infused rats .
We also examined the neuroprotective effects of <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> in vitro using SH - SY 5 Y cells .
Cells were pretreated with <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> , before exposed to <START:Chemical> amyloid beta peptide ( 1 - 42 ) <END> , <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> or <START:Chemical> H 2 O 2 <END> .
We found that <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species , cytochrome c release , and caspase 3 activation .
Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together , our study suggests that <START:Chemical> maltolyl p - coumarate <END> is a potentially effective candidate against <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> that is characterized by wide spread <START:Disease> neuronal death <END> and progressive <START:Disease> decline of cognitive function <END> .
<START:Chemical> Galanthamine hydrobromide <END> , a longer acting anticholinesterase drug , in the treatment of the central effects of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Hyoscine <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Galanthamine hydrobromide <END> , an anticholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood - brain barrier , was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> hyoscine <END> ) <START:Disease> overdosage <END> .
It is longer acting than <START:Chemical> physostigmine <END> and is used in anaesthesia to reverse the non - depolarizing neuromuscular block .
However , studies into the dose necessary to combating <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> intoxication are indicated .
Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> on canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
Antiarrhythmic effects of ( + ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> and ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> were examined using two canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> models .
<START:Chemical> Digitalis <END> <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , which is suppressed by <START:Chemical> Na <END> channel blockers , was induced by intermittent intravenous ( i . v . ) injection of <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> in <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> - anesthetized dogs .
<START:Disease> Adrenaline arrhythmia <END> , which is suppressed by <START:Chemical> Ca <END> channel blockers , was induced by <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> infusion in <START:Chemical> halothane <END> - anesthetized dogs .
Ten and 5 mg / kg i . v . ( + ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> suppressed <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> , respectively .
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of ( + ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> for <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 4 and 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 6 micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SD , n = 6 ) .
A lower dose of 1 mg / kg i . v . of ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> suppressed the <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , whereas 5 mg / kg i . v . was needed to suppress <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> .
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> for <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> were 0 . 06 + / - 0 . 04 and 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 1 micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SD , n = 6 ) .
The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> indicates that ( - ) - isomer may have an effect nearly 5 - 20 times stronger in suppressing <START:Chemical> Na <END> channels , but effects of both drugs on <START:Chemical> Ca <END> channels may be almost equipotent .
Safety profile of a <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> lozenge compared with that of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions : a 12 - week , randomized , open - label study .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> polacrilex lozenges deliver 25 % to 27 % more <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> compared with equivalent doses of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> polacrilex gum .
The increased <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4 - mg <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> lozenge and 4 - mg <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> gum in smokers with selected label - restricted diseases .
METHODS : This was a multicenter , randomized , open - label study in adult smokers with <START:Disease> heart disease <END> , <START:Disease> hypertension <END> not controlled by medication , and / or <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> .
Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive the 4 - mg <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> lozenge or 4 - mg <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> gum .
Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 12 weeks after the start of product use .
RESULTS : Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment , 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum ( safety population ) .
The majority were women ( 52 . 7 % ) .
Patients ' mean age was 53 . 9 years , their mean weight was 193 . 9 pounds , and they smoked a mean of 25 . 2 cigarettes per day at baseline .
Five hundred fifty - three patients , 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum , used the study product for > or = 4 days per week during the first 2 weeks ( evaluable population ) .
The <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> lozenge and <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> gum were equally well tolerated , despite increased <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> exposure from the lozenge .
The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use ( evaluation population : 55 . 3 % lozenge , 54 . 7 % gum ) , as well as during the entire study ( safety population : 63 . 8 % and 58 . 6 % , respectively ) .
Stratification of patients by sex , age , extent of concurrent smoking , extent of product use , and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum .
The most common adverse events were <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( 17 . 2 % and 16 . 1 % ; 95 % CI , - 3 . 7 to 6 . 0 ) , <START:Disease> hiccups <END> ( 10 . 7 % and 6 . 6 % ; 95 % CI , 0 . 5 to 7 . 8 ) , and <START:Disease> headache <END> ( 8 . 7 % and 9 . 9 % ; 95 % Cl , - 5 . 0 to 2 . 6 ) .
Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups .
Fewer than 6 % of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study .
The majority of patients ( > 60 % ) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline .
CONCLUSION : The 4 - mg <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> lozenge and 4 - mg <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label - restricted medical conditions .
<START:Chemical> GABA <END> involvement in <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> induced reversal of <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> produced by <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> .
No agent is yet available to reverse <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> produced by CNS depressants , such as general anesthetics .
In this study <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> reversed <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> in rats .
25 mg / kg , i . v . <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate , increased <START:Chemical> GABA <END> , decreased <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> , and had no effect on <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> or <START:Chemical> glycine <END> levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem .
Pretreatment of rats with <START:Chemical> thiosemicarbazide <END> for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> .
50 mg / kg , i . v . <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> produced <START:Disease> respiratory arrest <END> with further increase in <START:Chemical> GABA <END> and decrease in <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the <START:Chemical> amino acids <END> studied in four regions of rat brain .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg , i . v . ) reversed <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> , <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> GABA <END> levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum .
These data suggest <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> reverses <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> produced by <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> and involves <START:Chemical> GABA <END> in its action .
Alpha and beta <START:Disease> coma <END> in drug intoxication uncomplicated by <START:Disease> cerebral hypoxia <END> .
Four patients who were rendered <START:Disease> comatose <END> or <START:Disease> stuporous <END> by drug intoxication , but who were not hypoxic , are described .
Three patients received high doses of <START:Chemical> chlormethiazole <END> for <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> <START:Disease> withdrawal symptoms <END> , and one took a suicidal <START:Disease> overdose <END> of <START:Chemical> nitrazepam <END> .
The patient with <START:Chemical> nitrazepam <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> and two of those with <START:Chemical> chlormethiazole <END> intoxication conformed to the criteria of ' alpha <START:Disease> coma <END> ' , showing non - reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG .
The fourth patient who was unconscious after <START:Chemical> chlormethiazole <END> administration exhibite generalized non - reactive activity in the slow beta range .
All four recovered completely without <START:Disease> neurological sequelae <END> following the withdrawal of the offending agents .
The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological <START:Disease> depression <END> of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed .
It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo - thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha <START:Disease> coma <END> .
It is concluded that when this electroencephalographic and behavioural picture is seen in drug intoxication , in the absence of significant <START:Disease> hypoxaemia <END> , a favourable outcome may be anticipated .
Effect of humoral modulators of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> increase in locomotor activity <END> of mice .
The effect of humoral modulators on the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> increase in locomotor activity <END> of mice was studied .
The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg / kg of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - HC 1 produced a marked <START:Disease> increase in locomotor activity <END> in mice .
The <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> was potentiated by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> and attenuated by <START:Chemical> physostigmine <END> .
In contrast , both <START:Chemical> methscopolamine <END> and <START:Chemical> neostigmine <END> , which do not penetrate the blood - brain barrier , had no effect on the <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> produced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Pretreatment of mice with <START:Chemical> alpha - methyltyrosine <END> ( 20 mg / kg i . p . , one hour ) , an inhibitor of <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> hydroxylase , significantly decreased the activity - increasing effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
On the other hand , pretreatment with <START:Chemical> p - chlorophenylalamine <END> ( 3 X 320 mg / kg i . p . , 24 hr ) , a <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> depletor , caused no significant change in the <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
The study suggests that the activity - increasing effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> are mediated by the release of <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> from adrenergic neurons in the brain .
And the results are consistent with the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> morphine <END> acts by retarding the release of <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> at some central cholinergic synapses .
It is also suggested from collected evidence that the activity - increasing effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in mice are mediated by mechanisms different from those which mediate the activity - increasing effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in rats .
Identification of a simple and sensitive microplate method for the detection of oversulfated <START:Chemical> chondroitin sulfate <END> in <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients .
Recently , a number of commercial lots of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated <START:Chemical> chondroitin sulfate <END> ( OSCS ) derivative that could elicit a <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response in pigs following a single high - dose infusion .
Using both contaminated <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products and the synthetically produced derivative , we showed that the OSCS produces dose - dependent <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in pigs .
The no observed effect level ( NOEL ) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1 mg / kg , corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3 % .
We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products using a simple , inexpensive , commercially available <START:Chemical> heparin <END> enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0 . 1 % , well below the NOEL .
This kit may provide a useful method to test <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives .
<START:Disease> Visual hallucinations <END> associated with <START:Chemical> zonisamide <END> .
<START:Chemical> Zonisamide <END> is a broad - spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Although <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent , we describe three patients who experienced complex <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> and altered mental status after <START:Chemical> zonisamide <END> treatment was begun or its dosage increased .
All three had been diagnosed earlier with <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> , and their electroencephalogram ( EEG ) findings were abnormal .
During monitoring , <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> did not correlate with EEG readings , nor did video recording capture any of the described events .
None of the patients had experienced <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> before this event .
The only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of <START:Chemical> zonisamide <END> .
With either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur .
Further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effect .
Until then , clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with <START:Chemical> zonisamide <END> .
<START:Chemical> Topiramate <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Topiramate <END> is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating <START:Disease> refractory seizures <END> .
Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause <START:Disease> metabolic acidosis <END> in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase .
In addition , a distal tubular acidification defect may result , thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH .
These factors can lead to the development of <START:Chemical> calcium phosphate <END> <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> .
We report the first two cases of <START:Chemical> topiramate <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> in the urologic literature .
Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> and its combinations with <START:Chemical> valproate <END> or <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> in amygdala - kindled rats .
<START:Chemical> Loreclezole <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala - kindled rats , reducing both <START:Disease> seizure <END> and afterdischarge durations .
The combinations of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) with <START:Chemical> valproate <END> , <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> , or <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> ( applied at their subprotective doses ) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test .
However , only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature .
Among several chemoconvulsants , <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> , <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartic acid <END> and <START:Chemical> BAY k - 8644 <END> ( the opener of L - type <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channels ) reversed the protective activity of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> alone and its combination with <START:Chemical> valproate <END> .
On the other hand , <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> , <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> and <START:Chemical> BAY k - 8644 <END> inhibited the anticonvulsive action of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> combined with <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> .
The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L - type of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channels .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbitone <END> - induced <START:Disease> enlargement of the liver <END> in the rat : its relationship to <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> - induced <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> .
The yield of severe <START:Disease> cirrhosis of the liver <END> ( defined as a shrunken finely nodular liver with micronodular histology , <START:Disease> ascites <END> greater than 30 ml , plasma albumin less than 2 . 2 g / dl , <START:Disease> splenomegaly <END> 2 - 3 times normal , and testicular <START:Disease> atrophy <END> approximately half normal weight ) after 12 doses of <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> given intragastrically in the <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> - primed rat was increased from 25 % to 56 % by giving the initial " calibrating " dose of <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> at the peak of the <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> - induced <START:Disease> enlargement of the liver <END> .
At this point it was assumed that the cytochrome P 450 / <START:Chemical> CCl 4 <END> toxic state was both maximal and stable .
The optimal rat size to begin <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> was determined as 100 g , and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47 % greater than normal rats of the same body weight .
The optimal time for the initial dose of <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> was after 14 days on <START:Chemical> phenobarbitone <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> , <START:Disease> autoimmune hemolytic anemia <END> , and <START:Disease> erythroblastocytopenia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> ceftriaxone <END> .
An 80 - yr - old man developed acute <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> shortly after ingesting oral <START:Chemical> ceftriaxone <END> .
Although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after withholding the <START:Chemical> beta lactam <END> antibiotic , there was a gradual increase in serum <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an <START:Disease> autoimmune hemolytic anemia <END> and <START:Disease> erythroblastocytopenia <END> .
These responded to systemic <START:Chemical> steroids <END> and immunoglobulins .
Despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with <START:Chemical> beta lactam <END> antibiotics .
Pharmacology of <START:Chemical> GYKI - 41 099 <END> ( <START:Chemical> chlorpropanol <END> , <START:Chemical> Tobanum <END> ) a new potent beta - adrenergic antagonist .
The compound <START:Chemical> GYKI - 41 099 <END> , as a beta - adrenergic antagonist , is 3 - 8 times more potent than <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> in vitro and in vivo .
Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> and <START:Chemical> pindolol <END> inhibiting the <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> in dogs and cats .
<START:Chemical> GYKI - 41 900 <END> has a negligible cardiodepressant activity ; it is not cardioselective .
The compound shows a rapid and long lasting effect .
There was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of <START:Chemical> 14 C - 41 099 <END> to rats and dogs .
The half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> associated with <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> : case presentation and literature review .
PURPOSE : We present a case of a patient who developed <START:Disease> seizures <END> shortly after initiating treatment with <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> and to discuss the potential drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P 450 ( CYP ) 1 A 2 in this case , as well as in other cases , of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
METHODS : Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE , Cochrane and Ovid .
The main search terms utilized were case report and <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> .
The search was limited to studies published in English .
RESULTS : Six cases of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> have been reported in the literature .
Drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP 1 A 2 by <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP 1 A 2 substrates .
Nature , time course and dose dependence of <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> - related side effects : results from the Multicenter Canadian <START:Chemical> Azidothymidine <END> Trial .
To characterize the nature , time course and dose dependency of <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> - related side effects , we undertook a multicenter , prospective , dose - range finding study .
Our study group consisted of 74 HIV - positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B , III and IV C 2 from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) classification of <START:Disease> HIV disease <END> .
Following a 3 - week observation period , volunteers were treated with <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> 600 mg / day for 18 weeks , 900 mg / day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg / day for 9 weeks , followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re - started on 1200 mg / day or the highest tolerated dose at 8 - hourly intervals .
Subjects were randomly assigned to 4 - hourly or 8 - hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg / day .
Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3 - week intervals .
Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96 % of subjects , most commonly <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( 64 % ) , <START:Disease> fatigue <END> ( 55 % ) and <START:Disease> headache <END> ( 49 % ) .
These were generally self - limited , reappearing briefly at each dose increment .
A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy .
This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment .
A red blood cell count decrease , a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose - independent fashion , reverting at least partially during the washout phase .
The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg / day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg / day .
Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by <START:Disease> megaloblastosis <END> in 95 % of 65 specimens at week 18 . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Increased sulfation and decreased 7 alpha - hydroxylation of <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> in <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Deoxycholic acid <END> conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> - treated rats .
Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> than <START:Chemical> taurodeoxycholic acid <END> , and both were decreased by <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> treatment .
During [ 24 - 14 C ] <START:Chemical> sodium deoxycholate <END> infusion , [ 14 C ] biliary <START:Chemical> bile acid <END> secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> - treated rats .
<START:Chemical> Ethinyl estradiol <END> - treated animals excreted significantly less 14 C as <START:Chemical> taurocholic acid <END> than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7 alpha - hydroxylation of <START:Chemical> taurodeoxycholic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ethinyl estradiol <END> treatment did not impair conjugation of <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> , but did result in an increase in sulfation of <START:Chemical> taurodeoxycholic acid <END> from 1 . 5 % in controls to nearly 4 . 0 % ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> than do certain other species .
Furthermore , the rat converts <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> , a poor choleretic , to <START:Chemical> taurocholic acid <END> , a good choleretic .
When this conversion is impaired with <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful <START:Chemical> bile acid <END> .
Diuretics , <START:Chemical> potassium <END> and <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> in <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> <START:Disease> coronary disease <END> .
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> can alter the tendency towards <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> .
If this were so , patients with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> might be especially susceptible .
Thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and known <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> after 8 weeks of treatment with a <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - conserving diuretic ( <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> ) and a similar period on a <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - losing diuretic ( <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> ) in a randomised study .
Plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> phase compared to <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> therapy .
Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> ( <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens .
Compared to <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> treatment , the <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> phase was associated with an increased frequency of <START:Disease> ventricular ectopic beats <END> ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring ) and a higher Lown grading , increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation .
The above results indicate that because <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with <START:Disease> ischaemic heart disease <END> , even minor falls in plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients .
Pneumonitis with <START:Disease> pleural and pericardial effusion <END> and <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> during <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> therapy .
A patient with <START:Disease> sinuatrial disease <END> and implanted pacemaker was treated with <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> ( maximum dose 1000 mg , maintenance dose 800 mg daily ) for 10 months , for control of <START:Disease> supraventricular tachyarrhythmias <END> .
He developed <START:Disease> pneumonitis <END> , <START:Disease> pleural and pericardial effusions <END> , and a predominantly <START:Disease> proximal motor neuropathy <END> .
Immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> and treatment with <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> .
Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> <START:Disease> pneumonitis <END> , immediate withdrawal of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> , and prompt but continued <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy to ensure full recovery .
Treatment of <START:Disease> Crohn ' s disease <END> with <START:Chemical> fusidic acid <END> : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to <START:Chemical> cyclosporin <END> .
Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T - cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of <START:Chemical> cyclosporin <END> .
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for <START:Disease> Crohn ' s disease <END> , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of <START:Chemical> fusidic acid <END> treatment in chronic active , therapy - resistant patients .
Eight <START:Disease> Crohn ' s disease <END> patients were included .
<START:Chemical> Fusidic acid <END> was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t . d . s . and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks .
The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score .
Five of 8 patients ( 63 % ) improved during <START:Chemical> fusidic acid <END> treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks .
There were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of <START:Disease> nausea <END> .
Biochemically , an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63 % ) , and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment .
All reversed to pre - treatment levels after cessation of treatment .
The results of this pilot study suggest that <START:Chemical> fusidic acid <END> may be of benefit in selected chronic active <START:Disease> Crohn ' s disease <END> patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective .
Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of <START:Chemical> fusidic acid <END> at the cytokine level in <START:Disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .
The effect of different anaesthetic agents in <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> following spinal anaesthesia .
The cause of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> after spinal anaesthesia is unknown .
Up until now , the only factor studied has been the effect of the diameter of the spinal needle on post - operative <START:Disease> sensorineural hearing loss <END> .
The aim of this study was to describe this <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> and to investigate other factors influencing the degree of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> .
Two groups of 22 similar patients were studied : one group received 6 mL <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> 2 % ; and the other received 3 mL <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> 0 . 5 % .
Patients given <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> were more likely to develop <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> ( 10 out of 22 ) than those given <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( 4 out of 22 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
The average <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> for speech frequencies was about 10 dB after <START:Chemical> prilocaine <END> and 15 dB after <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
None of the patients complained of subjective <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> .
Long - term follow - up of the patients was not possible .
Extrapyramidal side effects with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> at comparable D 2 receptor occupancy levels .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 and <START:Chemical> serotonin 5 - HT 2 <END> receptors .
Previous clinical studies have proposed that <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> ' s pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative <START:Disease> psychotic symptoms <END> and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects ; features shared by so - called ' atypical ' neuroleptics .
To determine if routine <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> treatment is associated with a unique degree of D 2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects , we used [ 123 I ] IBZM SPECT to determine D 2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> ( n = 12 ) or <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( n = 7 ) .
Both <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> produced D 2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90 % at standard clinical doses .
There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> or <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
<START:Disease> Drug - induced parkinsonism <END> was observed in subjects treated with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> ( 42 % ) and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 29 % ) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60 % .
Based on these observations , it is concluded that 5 - HT 2 blockade obtained with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> at D 2 occupancy rates of 60 % and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects .
<START:Disease> End - stage renal disease <END> ( <START:Disease> ESRD <END> ) after orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) using calcineurin - based immunotherapy : risk of development and treatment .
BACKGROUND : The calcineurin inhibitors <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> are both known to be <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> .
Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) has dramatically improved success rates .
Recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with <START:Disease> end - stage renal disease <END> ( <START:Disease> ESRD <END> ) .
This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> and <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CRF <END> ) in OLTX patients .
METHODS : Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834 ) .
Our prospectively collected database was the source of information .
Patients were divided into three groups : Controls , no <START:Disease> CRF <END> or <START:Disease> ESRD <END> , n = 748 ; <START:Disease> CRF <END> , sustained serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> > 2 . 5 mg / dl , n = 41 ; and <START:Disease> ESRD <END> , n = 45 .
Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> therapy , and survival from onset of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> .
RESULTS : At 13 years after OLTX , the incidence of severe <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> was 18 . 1 % ( <START:Disease> CRF <END> 8 . 6 % and <START:Disease> ESRD <END> 9 . 5 % ) .
Compared with control patients , <START:Disease> CRF <END> and <START:Disease> ESRD <END> patients had higher preoperative serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels , a greater percentage of patients with <START:Disease> hepatorenal syndrome <END> , higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 - year serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> .
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of <START:Disease> CRF <END> or <START:Disease> ESRD <END> with odds ratios of 2 . 6 , 2 . 2 , and 1 . 6 , respectively .
Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had <START:Disease> ESRD <END> was only 28 . 2 % compared with 54 . 6 % in the control group .
Patients developing <START:Disease> ESRD <END> had a 6 - year survival after onset of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71 . 4 % for the patients developing <START:Disease> ESRD <END> who subsequently received kidney transplants .
CONCLUSIONS : Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have <START:Disease> CRF <END> and <START:Disease> ESRD <END> at a high rate .
The development of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only .
Patients who develop <START:Disease> ESRD <END> have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and are more likely to have <START:Disease> hepatorenal syndrome <END> .
However , an increase of serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of <START:Disease> CRF <END> or <START:Disease> ESRD <END> .
New strategies for long - term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication .
Investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
<START:Disease> Mitochondrial abnormalities <END> have been associated with several aspects of epileptogenesis , such as energy generation , control of cell <START:Disease> death <END> , neurotransmitter synthesis , and free radical ( FR ) production .
Increased production of FRs may cause mtDNA damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mtDNA - encoded subunits .
In this study , we investigated whether increased generation of FR during <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO ) , complex IV of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> model of <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> .
DNA analysis revealed low amounts of a 4 . 8 kb mtDNA deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental groups .
We did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mtDNA - encoded subunit of CCO ( CCO - I ) or a relative decrease in CCO - I when compared with nuclear - encoded subunits ( CCO - IV and SDH - fp ) .
No abnormality in CCO activity was observed through histochemistry .
Although evidences of <START:Disease> mitochondrial abnormalities <END> were found in previously published studies , our results do not suggest that the FRs , generated during the acute phase , determined important abnormalities in mtDNA , in expression of CCO - I , and in CCO activity .
<START:Disease> Hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> associated with ingestion of <START:Chemical> quinine <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> following <START:Chemical> quinine <END> ingestion is a newly described phenomenon , with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature .
We describe a 5 th case .
The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of <START:Chemical> quinine <END> .
Treatment has included use of plasma exchange , <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> , <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> , and <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> .
The patients have all regained some degree of renal function .
However , it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement .
<START:Chemical> Quinine <END> - associated <START:Disease> hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> probably occurs more often than is recognized .
It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further <START:Chemical> quinine <END> exposure , since the reaction seems to be recurrent .
Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in humans .
The effect of <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects .
Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) and effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF ) were measured by inulin and <START:Chemical> para - aminohippurate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAH <END> ) clearance , respectively .
Anesthesia was maintained with <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> , <START:Chemical> nitrous oxide <END> , <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> , and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> was induced for 236 . 9 + / - 15 . 1 min by increasing the <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59 . 8 + / - 0 . 4 mmHg .
GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Postoperatively , ERPF returned to preoperative values , whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values .
Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when <START:Disease> hypotension <END> was induced , allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow .
We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed .
Effects of deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> with <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> on neuropsychological function .
The effect of deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients .
Twenty - four patients were anaesthetized for middle - ear surgery with deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> with <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> ( <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> group ) .
Seventeen patients without <START:Disease> hypotension <END> served as a control group .
The mean arterial pressure was 77 + / - 2 mmHg ( 10 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) before <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and 50 + / - 0 mmHg ( 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 0 kPa ) during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> group , and 86 + / - 2 mmHg ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) during anaesthesia in the control group .
The following psychological tests were performed : four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( similarities , digit span , vocabulary and digit symbol ) , Trail - Making tests A and B , Zung tests ( self - rating <START:Disease> anxiety <END> scale and self - rating <START:Disease> depression <END> scale ) and two - part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall .
The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively .
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value .
The results indicate that <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> with <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia .
Habitual use of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> as a risk factor for <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> : a comparison with <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> .
Six epidemiologic studies in the United States and Europe indicate that habitual use of <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> is associated with the development of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> and <START:Disease> end - stage renal disease <END> ( <START:Disease> ESRD <END> ) , with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19 .
As a result of these and other studies , <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> has now been withdrawn from the market in most countries .
However , three case control studies , one each in North Carolina , northern Maryland , and West Berlin , Germany , showed that habitual use of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> is also associated with <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> and <START:Disease> ESRD <END> , with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4 .
These studies suggest that both <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> and <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> may contribute to the burden of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> , with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former .
This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> potential of the drugs themselves .
A lower relative risk would be expected for <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone .
Thus , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics , whereas <START:Chemical> phenacetin <END> was available only in combinations .
The possibility that habitual use of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> alone increases the risk of <START:Disease> ESRD <END> has not been clearly demonstrated , but cannot be dismissed .
<START:Disease> Neuroinflammation <END> and <START:Disease> behavioral abnormalities <END> after neonatal <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> treatment in rats : implications for <START:Disease> autism <END> .
<START:Disease> Autism <END> is a <START:Disease> neurodevelopmental disorder <END> presenting before 3 years of age with <START:Disease> deficits in communication and social skills <END> and <START:Disease> repetitive behaviors <END> .
In addition to genetic influences , recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for <START:Disease> autism <END> .
<START:Chemical> Terbutaline <END> , a beta 2 - adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest <START:Disease> preterm labor <END> , has been associated with increased concordance for <START:Disease> autism <END> in dizygotic twins .
We studied the effects of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rats .
Newborn rats were given <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) daily on postnatal days ( PN ) 2 to 5 or PN 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at PN 30 .
Immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> on PN 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on PN 30 in the cerebral cortex , as well as in cerebellar and cerebrocortical white matter .
None of these effects occurred in animals given <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> on PN 11 to 14 .
In behavioral tests , animals treated with <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> on PN 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper - reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field , as well as in the acoustic startle response test .
Our findings indicate that beta 2 - adrenoceptor overstimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuroinflammatory pathways and <START:Disease> behavioral abnormalities <END> , similar to those described in <START:Disease> autism <END> .
This study provides a useful animal model for understanding the neuropathological processes underlying <START:Disease> autism spectrum disorders <END> .
Arterial <START:Disease> hypertension <END> as a complication of prolonged <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> treatment .
Two of 14 patients with <START:Disease> Cushing ' s syndrome <END> treated on a long - term basis with <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> developed sustained <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
In both cases normal plasma and urinary free <START:Chemical> cortisol <END> levels had been achieved following <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> therapy , yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated <START:Disease> hypertension <END> 31 ( patient 1 ) and 52 weeks ( patient 2 ) after treatment .
In patient 1 , plasma levels of <START:Chemical> deoxycorticosterone <END> and <START:Chemical> 11 - deoxycortisol <END> were elevated .
In patient 2 , in addition to an increase in both <START:Chemical> deoxycorticosterone <END> and <START:Chemical> 11 - deoxycortisol <END> levels , plasma <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> values were raised , with a concomitant suppression of renin levels .
Our findings show that long - term treatment with high doses of <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid - related <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Development of <START:Disease> ocular myasthenia <END> during <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> treatment for <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> .
A 63 - year - old male experienced sudden <START:Disease> diplopia <END> after 9 weeks of administration of <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon ( IFN ) alpha - 2 b <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> for <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> ( <START:Disease> CHC <END> ) .
Ophthalmologic examinations showed <START:Disease> ptosis on the right upper lid <END> and <START:Disease> restricted right eye movement <END> without any other neurological signs .
A brain imaging study and repetitive nerve stimulation test indicated no abnormality .
The <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor antibody titer and response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were negative , and the results of thyroid function tests were normal .
The patient ' s ophthalmological symptoms improved rapidly 3 weeks after discontinuation of <START:Chemical> pegylated IFN alpha - 2 b <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
The <START:Disease> ocular myasthenia <END> associated with combination therapy of <START:Chemical> pegylated IFN alpha - 2 b <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> for <START:Disease> CHC <END> is very rarely reported ; therefore , we present this case with a review of the various eye complications of <START:Chemical> IFN <END> therapy .
Efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> in a placebo - and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Asenapine <END> is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> or of <START:Disease> manic <END> or mixed episodes associated with <START:Disease> bipolar I disorder <END> with or without <START:Disease> psychotic <END> features .
In a double - blind 6 - week trial , 458 patients with acute <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> were randomly assigned to fixed - dose treatment with <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 5 mg twice daily ( BID ) , <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 10 mg BID , placebo , or <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> at 4 mg BID ( to verify assay sensitivity ) .
With last observations carried forward ( LOCF ) , mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 5 mg BID ( - 16 . 2 ) and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( - 15 . 4 ) than placebo ( - 10 . 7 ; both P < 0 . 05 ) ; using mixed model for repeated measures ( MMRM ) , changes at day 42 were significantly greater with <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 5 and 10 mg BID ( - 21 . 3 and - 19 . 4 , respectively ) and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( - 20 . 0 ) than placebo ( - 14 . 6 ; all P < 0 . 05 ) .
On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale , all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM ; <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM .
Treatment - related adverse events ( AEs ) occurred in 44 % and 52 % , 57 % , and 41 % of the <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 5 and 10 mg BID , <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , and placebo groups , respectively .
<START:Disease> Extrapyramidal symptoms <END> reported as AEs occurred in 15 % and 18 % , 34 % , and 10 % of the <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> at 5 and 10 mg BID , <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , and placebo groups , respectively .
Across all groups , no more than 5 % of patients had clinically significant weight change .
Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with <START:Chemical> asenapine <END> and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ; greater contrasts were seen in AEs , especially <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> .
Some central effects of repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> , a selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> uptake inhibitor , on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and <START:Chemical> methoxamine <END> and on the animal behavior in the " behavioral despair " test .
A repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> ( twice daily for 14 days ) potentiated in mice and in rats ( weaker ) the <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
The <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> nomifensine <END> in mice remained unaffected by <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered <START:Chemical> methoxamine <END> was not affected by repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
Given three times <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> had no effect on the immobilization time in the " behavioral despair " test in rats .
The results indicate that <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> given repeatedly acts differently than <START:Chemical> citalopram <END> , another selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> uptake inhibitor , and differs also from other antidepressant drugs .
A transient <START:Disease> neurological deficit <END> following intrathecal injection of 1 % hyperbaric <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> for unilateral spinal anaesthesia .
We describe a case of transient <START:Disease> neurological deficit <END> that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1 % hyperbaric <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> slowly injected through a 25 - gauge pencil - point spinal needle .
The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful , but 3 days after surgery , the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L 3 - L 4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on ( <START:Disease> loss of pinprick sensation <END> ) without reduction in muscular strength .
Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks .
Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow - up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect .
However , we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution ( if pencil - point needle and slow injection rate are employed ) , in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration , which might lead to a transient <START:Disease> neurological deficit <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiac arrest <END> in a child with <START:Disease> cerebral palsy <END> undergoing <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> induction of anesthesia after preoperative <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Clonidine <END> is a frequently administered alpha 2 - adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure .
We present a case of a 5 - year - old child with <START:Disease> cerebral palsy <END> and <START:Disease> seizure disorder <END> , receiving <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> for <START:Disease> restlessness <END> , who presented for placement of a <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> pump .
Without the knowledge of the medical personnel , the patient ' s mother administered three doses of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce <START:Disease> anxiety <END> .
During induction of anesthesia , the patient developed <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> requiring cardiac resuscitation .
There are no previous reports of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> - associated <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia .
Delayed - onset <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> presents 5 to 12 days after <START:Chemical> heparin <END> exposure , with or without <START:Disease> arterial or venous thromboemboli <END> .
Delayed recognition and treatment of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> contribute to poor patient outcomes .
OBJECTIVE : To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> are delayed .
DESIGN : Retrospective case series .
SETTING : Three large urban hospitals ( with active cardiovascular surgery programs ) .
PATIENTS : 14 patients seen over a 3 - year period in whom <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> became apparent on delayed presentation with <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> complications .
MEASUREMENTS : Platelet counts , onset of objectively determined <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> , results of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests , and outcomes .
RESULTS : Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included <START:Chemical> heparin <END> exposure -- in most cases , with no <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> recognized -- only to return to the hospital ( median , day 14 ) with <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> complications .
<START:Disease> Thromboemboli <END> were venous ( 12 patients , 7 with <START:Disease> pulmonary emboli <END> ) or arterial ( 4 patients ) or both .
Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation .
On readmission , 11 patients received therapeutic <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , which worsened the patients ' clinical condition and , in all 11 cases , decreased the platelet count ( mean at readmission , 143 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ; mean nadir after <START:Chemical> heparin <END> re - exposure , 39 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ) .
Results of serologic tests for <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced antibodies were positive in all patients .
Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants ( 11 patients ) , thrombolytic drugs ( 3 patients ) , inferior vena cava filters ( 3 patients ) and , eventually , <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> ( 11 patients ) .
Three patients died .
CONCLUSIONS : Delayed - onset <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> is increasingly being recognized .
To avoid disastrous outcomes , physicians must consider <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> ; therapy with alternative anticoagulants , not <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , should be initiated .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor - associated <START:Disease> angioedema <END> of the stomach and small intestine : a case report .
This is a case report on a 45 - year old African - American female with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , who was started on a combination pill of <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> / <START:Chemical> benazapril <END> 10 / 5 mg .
The very next day , she presented at the emergency room ( ER ) with <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> .
Physical exam , complete metabolic panel , and hemogram were in the normal range .
She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics .
However , she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints .
This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion .
CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach , duodenum and jejunum , along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) - induced <START:Disease> angioedema <END> was suspected , and anti - <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> medications were discontinued .
Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours , and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of <START:Disease> ascites <END> .
The recognition of <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme ( ACE ) and <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> receptor blocker ( ARB ) <START:Disease> intestinal angioedema <END> constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians , internists , emergency room personal and surgeons .
<START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> withdrawal as a possible cause of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in a <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> woman with a normal coronary angiogram .
<START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> is an effective and relatively - safe antihypertensive drug .
Serious adverse effects are uncommon and mainly have been related to the <START:Disease> depression <END> of cardiac contractility and conduction , especially when the drug is combined with beta - blocking agents .
We report a case in which <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> coincided with the introduction of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> and the withdrawal of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> in a previously asymptomatic woman with severe <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Possible mechanisms that involve a <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> - related increase in platelet and / or vascular alpha 2 - adrenoreceptor affinity for <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> are discussed .
<START:Disease> Hyperglycemic acidotic coma <END> and death in <START:Disease> Kearns - Sayre syndrome <END> .
This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long - standing <START:Disease> Kearns - Sayre syndrome <END> .
Following short exposure to oral <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> , both boys developed <START:Disease> lethargy <END> , increasing <START:Disease> somnolence <END> , <START:Disease> polydipsia <END> , <START:Disease> polyphagia <END> , and <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
Both presented in the emergency room with profound <START:Disease> coma <END> , <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , severe <START:Disease> hyperglycemia <END> , and <START:Disease> acidosis <END> .
Nonketotic <START:Disease> lactic acidosis <END> was present in one and <START:Disease> ketosis <END> without a known serum <START:Chemical> lactate <END> level was present in the other .
<START:Disease> Respiratory failure <END> rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation .
We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic <START:Disease> metabolic - endocrine failure <END> in the <START:Disease> Kearns - Sayre syndrome <END> .
Inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor secretion into the hypophysial - portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feedback .
<START:Chemical> Nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> evokes ACTH secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin - releasing factor ( irCRF ) into the hypophysial - portal circulation .
Portal plasma concentrations of neither <START:Chemical> arginine vasopressin <END> nor <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> are significantly altered in this paradigm .
Application of a delayed feedback signal , in the form of a 2 - h systemic <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> infusion in <START:Chemical> urethane <END> - anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis , is without effect on the resting secretion of <START:Chemical> arginine vasopressin <END> and <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> at any <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> feedback dose tested .
Resting irCRF levels are suppressed only at the highest <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> infusion rate , which resulted in systemic <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> levels of 40 micrograms / dl .
Suppression of irCRF secretion in response to <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> is observed and occurs at a plasma <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> level between 8 - 12 micrograms / dl .
These studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of irCRF release .
Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> in the rat .
The <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> caused by a single dose of <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> in rats was studied with a computer - assisted morphometric method .
Scatter diagrams of the g ratio ( quotient fibre diameter / axon diameter ) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population , distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre .
There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population , causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> D 2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) , through D 1 / D 2 receptor - mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of <START:Disease> epileptic seizures <END> arising in the limbic system .
<START:Disease> Excitotoxicity <END> leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of <START:Disease> seizures <END> at the cellular level .
In this respect , little is known about the role of <START:Chemical> DA <END> receptors in the occurrence of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - induced neuronal cell death .
Here we analyze the occurrence of <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> in D 2 R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
We compared these results with those previously obtained with <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> KA <END> ) , a potent <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> agonist .
Importantly , D 2 R - / - mice develop <START:Disease> seizures <END> at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
However , <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D 2 R - / - brains in comparison to <START:Chemical> KA <END> .
Thus , the absence of D 2 R lowers the threshold for <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by both <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> .
Moreover , the dopaminergic control of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurodegeneration <END> seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D 2 R signaling with these two neurotransmitters .
Massive <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> after oral <START:Chemical> bisphosphonate <END> ( <START:Chemical> alendronate <END> ) administration in a patient with <START:Disease> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> .
A 61 - year - old Japanese man with <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> due to <START:Disease> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> was initially responding well to <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy .
The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15 . 6 to 2 . 8 g .
Within 14 days of the oral <START:Chemical> bisphosphonate <END> ( <START:Chemical> alendronate sodium <END> ) administration , the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12 . 8 g with <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
After discontinuing the oral <START:Chemical> alendronate <END> , the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis .
Urinary volume and serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels recovered to the normal range , with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days .
This report demonstrates that not only intravenous , but also oral <START:Chemical> bisphosphonates <END> can aggravate <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
Assessment of a new non - invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
BACKGROUND : Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index ( dP / dtejc ) measurement , based on brachial artery flow changes , as compared to standard 12 - lead ECG , for detecting <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> , using <START:Chemical> Tc 99 m - Sestamibi <END> single - photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> .
METHODS : The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing <START:Chemical> Sestamibi <END> - SPECT / <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress test .
Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP / dtejc were performed at each <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> level .
In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with <START:Disease> ischemia <END> were detected on SPECT .
The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group .
dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results , giving an ECG - enhanced value , and compared to ECG alone .
RESULTS : The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16 % to 79 % , positive predictive value increased from 60 % to 68 % and negative predictive value from 54 % to 78 % , and specificity decreased from 90 % to 67 % .
CONCLUSIONS : If ECG alone is used for specificity , the combination with dP / dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost - savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> , especially in patients unable to exercise .
<START:Disease> Toxicity <END> due to remission inducing drugs in <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Association with HLA - B 35 and Cw 4 antigens .
Twenty - five patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RA <END> ) who developed <START:Disease> toxicity <END> while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens .
A strong association has been found between <START:Disease> nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> Tiopronin <END> ( a <START:Chemical> D - Penicillamine <END> like compound ) and class I antigens B 35 - Cw 4 , and between <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> gold <END> <START:Chemical> thiosulphate <END> and B 35 .
Compared to healthy controls a lower DR 5 frequency was observed in patients with <START:Disease> RA <END> except for the <START:Chemical> Tiopronin <END> related <START:Disease> nephritis <END> group .
Permeability , ultrastructural changes , and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
BACKGROUND / AIMS : It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> starts .
Using <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> ( PAN ) rats , we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte - associated molecules nephrin , a - actinin , dendrin , and plekhh 2 , the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes .
METHODS : Using immune stainings , semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope .
Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers .
Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested .
RESULTS : By day 2 , some patchy foot process effacement , but no <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , appeared .
The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas .
The other proteins showed few changes , which were limited to diseased areas .
By day 4 , foot process effacement was complete and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage .
Nephrin decreased further , while dendrin and plekhh 2 also decreased but a - actinin remained unchanged .
ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect .
CONCLUSIONS : PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4 , despite relatively mild <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
This was preceded by altered nephrin expression , supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology .
The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh 2 were both reduced , suggesting roles in PAN , whereas a - actinin was unchanged .
Transketolase abnormality in <START:Chemical> tolazamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> .
We studied a <START:Chemical> thiamine <END> - dependent enzyme , transketolase , from fibroblasts of a <START:Disease> diabetic <END> patient who developed <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> when treated with <START:Chemical> tolazamide <END> , in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [ high Km for <START:Chemical> thiamine pyrophosphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> TPP <END> ) ] , as previously reported in postalcoholic <START:Disease> Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome <END> .
In addition to this patient , we also studied this enzyme from three <START:Disease> diabetic <END> kindreds without any history of <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> and from four normal controls .
We found that the above - mentioned patient and one of the <START:Disease> diabetic <END> kindreds with no history of <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for <START:Chemical> TPP <END> .
These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic <START:Disease> Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome <END> and the patient with <START:Chemical> tolazamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality .
<START:Disease> Brainstem dysgenesis <END> in an infant prenatally exposed to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal <START:Disease> cocaine abuse <END> during pregnancy .
Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of <START:Disease> fetal anomalies <END> .
We report on an infant with <START:Disease> multiple cranial - nerve involvement <END> attributable to <START:Disease> brainstem dysgenesis <END> , born to a <START:Disease> cocaine - addicted <END> mother .
Midline B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> nerves in rat medulla are involved in <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> .
Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> onto the ventrolateral cells of the B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> neurons in the medulla elicits a <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord .
The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> neurons in the medulla , coinciding with the raphe magnus .
In spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> , <START:Disease> stroke <END> - prone rats , microinjection of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> into the area of the midline B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent <START:Disease> hypotension <END> of 30 - 40 mm Hg , which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> neurotoxin <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DHT <END> ) injected intracerebroventricularly .
However , intraspinal injection of <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DHT <END> to produce a more selective lesion of only descending <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> projections in the spinal cord did not affect this <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Further , <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DHT <END> lesion of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle , one of the main ascending pathways from the B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> cells , did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> injection .
It is concluded therefore that , unlike the ventrolateral B 3 cells which mediate a <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> via descending projections , the midline <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> B 3 cells in the medulla contribute to the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> action of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> , either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle , or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem .
Effects of training on the extent of experimental <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in aging rats .
The effects of exercise on the severity of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> were studied in female albino rats of 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 weeks of age .
The rats were trained to swim for a specific duration and for a particular period .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> infarcts <END> were confirmed by histological methods .
Elevations in the serum GOT and GPT were maximum in the sedentary - <START:Chemical> isoproterenols <END> and minimum in the exercise - controls .
These changes in the serum transaminases were associated with corresponding depletions in the cardiac GOT and GPT .
However , age was seen to interfere with the responses exhibited by the young and old rats .
Studies dealing with <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> are more informative when dealt with age .
Optimising <START:Disease> stroke <END> prevention in non - valvular <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> .
<START:Disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality .
Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> reduces the risk of <START:Disease> stroke <END> by 62 % , and that <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> alone reduces the risk by 22 % .
Overall , in high - risk patients , <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> is superior to <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> in preventing <START:Disease> strokes <END> , with a relative risk reduction of 36 % .
<START:Chemical> Ximelagatran <END> , an oral direct thrombin inhibitor , was found to be as efficient as <START:Chemical> vitamin K <END> antagonist drugs in the prevention of <START:Disease> embolic events <END> , but has been recently withdrawn because of <START:Disease> abnormal liver function <END> tests .
The ACTIVE - W ( <START:Disease> Atrial Fibrillation <END> <START:Chemical> Clopidogrel <END> Trial with <START:Chemical> Irbesartan <END> for Prevention of Vascular Events ) study has demonstrated that <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> is superior to platelet therapy ( <START:Chemical> clopidogrel <END> plus <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ) in the prevention af <START:Disease> embolic events <END> .
<START:Chemical> Idraparinux <END> , a Factor Xa inhibitor , is being evaluated in patients with <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitors and <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> receptor - blocking drugs hold promise in <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> through <START:Disease> cardiac remodelling <END> .
Preliminary studies suggest that <START:Chemical> statins <END> could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardioversion .
Finally , percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high - risk patients .
<START:Chemical> Lamotrigine <END> associated with exacerbation or de novo <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> in <START:Disease> idiopathic generalized epilepsies <END> .
Five patients with <START:Disease> idiopathic generalized epilepsies <END> ( <START:Disease> IGE <END> ) treated with <START:Chemical> lamotrigine <END> ( <START:Chemical> LTG <END> ) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> ( <START:Disease> MJ <END> ) .
In three patients , <START:Chemical> LTG <END> exacerbated <START:Disease> MJ <END> in a dose - dependent manner with early aggravation during titration .
<START:Disease> MJ <END> disappeared when <START:Chemical> LTG <END> dose was decreased by 25 to 50 % .
In two patients , <START:Chemical> LTG <END> exacerbated <START:Disease> MJ <END> in a delayed but more severe manner , with <START:Disease> myoclonic status <END> that only ceased after <START:Chemical> LTG <END> withdrawal .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> following the initiation of <START:Chemical> tizanidine <END> in a patient treated with an <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> converting enzyme inhibitor for chronic <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Centrally acting alpha - 2 adrenergic agonists are one of several pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of <START:Disease> spasticity <END> related to <START:Disease> disorders of the central nervous system <END> .
In addition to their effects on <START:Disease> spasticity <END> , certain adverse cardiorespiratory effects have been reported .
Adults chronically treated with <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> converting enzyme inhibitors may have a limited ability to respond to <START:Disease> hypotension <END> when the sympathetic response is simultaneously blocked .
The authors present a 10 - year - old boy chronically treated with <START:Chemical> lisinopril <END> , an <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> converting enzyme inhibitor , to control <START:Disease> hypertension <END> who developed <START:Disease> hypotension <END> following the addition of <START:Chemical> tizanidine <END> , an alpha - 2 agonist , for the treatment of <START:Disease> spasticity <END> .
The possible interaction of <START:Chemical> tizanidine <END> and other antihypertensive agents should be kept in mind when prescribing therapy to treat either <START:Disease> hypertension <END> or <START:Disease> spasticity <END> in such patients .
Mechanisms of <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in the rat .
- <START:Chemical> Tacrolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ) is a powerful , widely used immunosuppressant .
The clinical utility of <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> is complicated by substantial <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
To clarify the mechanisms of <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , we studied the chronic effects of <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> on the synthesis of endothelin - 1 ( ET - 1 ) , the expression of mRNA of ET - 1 and endothelin - converting enzyme - 1 ( ECE - 1 ) , the endothelial <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase ( eNOS ) activity , and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C - type natriuretic peptide ( CNP ) in rat blood vessels .
In addition , the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> FR 139317 <END> on <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in rats was studied .
<START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , 5 mg . kg - 1 . d - 1 given for 4 weeks , elevated blood pressure from 102 + / - 13 to 152 + / - 15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET - 1 and the levels of ET - 1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery ( 240 % and 230 % , respectively ) .
Little change was observed in the expression of ECE - 1 mRNA and CNP mRNA .
<START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta ( 48 % and 55 % , respectively ) .
The administration of <START:Chemical> FR 139317 <END> ( 10 mg . kg - 1 . d - 1 ) prevented <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in rats .
These results indicate that <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET - 1 production but also by decreasing <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthesis in the vasculature .
Two prodrugs of potent and selective GluR 5 <START:Chemical> kainate <END> receptor antagonists actives in three animal models of <START:Disease> pain <END> .
Amino acids 5 and 7 , two potent and selective competitive GluR 5 <START:Chemical> KA <END> receptor antagonists , exhibited high GluR 5 receptor affinity over other <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptors .
Their ester prodrugs 6 and 8 were orally active in three models of <START:Disease> pain <END> : reversal of <START:Chemical> formalin <END> - induced paw licking , <START:Chemical> carrageenan <END> - induced <START:Disease> thermal hyperalgesia <END> , and <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> mechanical hyperalgesia <END> .
Repeated <START:Chemical> trimipramine <END> induces <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 / D 3 and alpha 1 - adrenergic up - regulation .
<START:Chemical> Trimipramine <END> ( <START:Chemical> TRI <END> ) , which shows a clinical <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> activity , is chemically related to <START:Chemical> imipramine <END> but does not inhibit the reuptake of <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> and <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamine <END> , nor does it induce beta - adrenergic down - regulation .
The mechanism of its <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> activity is still unknown .
The aim of the present study was to find out whether <START:Chemical> TRI <END> given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha 1 - adrenergic systems , demonstrated by us previously for various <START:Chemical> antidepressants <END> .
<START:Chemical> TRI <END> was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days .
In the acute experiment <START:Chemical> TRI <END> ( given i . p . ) does not antagonize the <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> in mice and does not potentiate the <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptophan <END> head twitches in rats .
<START:Chemical> TRI <END> given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> d - amphetamine <END> , <START:Chemical> quinpirole <END> and ( + ) - 7 - hydroxy - dipropyloaminotetralin ( <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 and D 3 effects ) .
The stereotypies induced by <START:Chemical> d - amphetamine <END> or <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> are not potentiated by <START:Chemical> TRI <END> .
It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> ( given intraventricularly ) in rats , evaluated in the open field test as well as the <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> evoked by <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> in mice , both these effects being mediated by an alpha 1 - adrenergic receptor .
It may be concluded that , like other tricyclic <START:Chemical> antidepressants <END> studied previously , <START:Chemical> TRI <END> given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 and D 3 ( locomotor activity but not stereotypy ) as well as alpha 1 - adrenergic receptors to their agonists .
A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated <START:Chemical> antidepressants <END> , suggested to be responsible for the <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> activity .
Amount of <START:Disease> bleeding <END> and <START:Disease> hematoma <END> size in the collagenase - induced <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> rat model .
The aggravated risk on <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> ICH <END> ) with drugs used for <START:Disease> stroke <END> patients should be estimated carefully .
We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat <START:Disease> ICH <END> model for detection of <START:Disease> ICH <END> deterioration .
In <START:Disease> ICH <END> intrastriatally induced by 0 . 014 - unit , 0 . 070 - unit , and 0 . 350 - unit collagenase , the amount of <START:Disease> bleeding <END> was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined <START:Disease> hematoma <END> volume .
The blood amounts and <START:Disease> hematoma <END> volumes were significantly correlated , and the <START:Disease> hematoma <END> induced by 0 . 014 - unit collagenase was adequate to detect <START:Disease> ICH <END> deterioration .
In <START:Disease> ICH <END> induction using 0 . 014 - unit collagenase , <START:Chemical> heparin <END> enhanced the <START:Disease> hematoma <END> volume 3 . 4 - fold over that seen in control <START:Disease> ICH <END> animals and the <START:Disease> bleeding <END> 7 . 6 - fold .
Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for <START:Disease> ICH <END> detection , and that a model with a small <START:Disease> ICH <END> induced with a low - dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect <START:Disease> ICH <END> .
Long - term <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment and the kidney .
Interim report on fifty patients .
This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long - term <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment on the kidney .
<START:Chemical> Creatinine <END> clearance , maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long - term <START:Chemical> lithium <END> for more than one year .
These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , available for most of our patients .
No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre - <START:Chemical> lithium <END> values .
Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients .
The concentration defect appeared reversible , at least in part .
<START:Disease> Polyuria <END> above 3 litres / 24 hours was found in 10 % of patients .
An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings .
Development of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac hypertrophy <END> .
The development of <START:Disease> cardiac hypertrophy <END> was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> ( <START:Chemical> ISO <END> ) ( 0 . 3 mg / kg body weight ) .
A time course was established for the change in tissue mass , RNA and DNA content , as well as <START:Chemical> hydroxyproline <END> content .
Heart weight increased 44 % after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3 . 4 days .
Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26 % after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy .
The half time for RNA accumulation was 2 . 0 days .
The total content of <START:Chemical> hydroxyproline <END> remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46 % after 4 days of therapy .
Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage ( 1 - 4 days ) of <START:Disease> hypertrophic <END> growth but increased to a new steady - state level 19 % above the controls after 8 days of treatment .
Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> .
However , dP / dt in the <START:Chemical> ISO <END> - treated hearts was slightly but significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) elevated .
These data indicate that the adaptive response to <START:Chemical> ISO <END> shows an early <START:Disease> hypertrophic <END> phase ( 1 - 4 days ) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA .
However , prolonged stimulation ( 8 - 12 days ) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> and <START:Disease> hyperplasia <END> within the heart .
Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ) for at least one year .
BACKGROUND : We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ) for more than 1 year .
METHODS : Twenty - six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated .
Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy ) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy ) .
RESULTS : The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap ) were acute rejection ( AR ; n = 4 ) , chronic rejection ( CR ; n = 5 ) , AR + CR ( n = 4 ) , recurrent <START:Disease> IgA nephropathy <END> ( n = 5 ) , normal findings ( n = 2 ) , minimal - type chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> ( n = 9 ) , and mild - type <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> ( n = 11 ) .
Of the nonepisode biopsies , 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal - type and mild - type chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> , respectively .
Chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization ( 5 biopsies ) , arteriolopathy ( angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall ; 20 biopsies ) , <START:Disease> focal segmental glomerulosclerosis <END> ( 4 biopsies ) and the striped form of <START:Disease> interstitial fibrosis <END> ( 11 biopsies ) .
The serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels of patients in the mild - type chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group , which included 7 episode biopsies , were statistically higher than those in the minimum - type chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall , and suggests that mild - type chronic <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function .
<START:Chemical> 22 - oxacalcitriol <END> suppresses <START:Disease> secondary hyperparathyroidism <END> without inducing <START:Disease> low bone turnover <END> in dogs with <START:Disease> renal failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Calcitriol <END> therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in patients with <START:Disease> renal failure <END> but has several drawbacks , including <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and / or marked <START:Disease> suppression of bone turnover <END> , which may lead to <START:Disease> adynamic bone disease <END> .
A new <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> analogue , <START:Chemical> 22 - oxacalcitriol <END> ( <START:Chemical> OCT <END> ) , has been shown to have promising characteristics .
This study was undertaken to determine the effects of <START:Chemical> OCT <END> on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or <START:Disease> impaired renal function <END> .
METHODS : Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) .
The animals received supplemental <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> to enhance PTH secretion .
Fourteen weeks after the start of <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of <START:Chemical> OCT <END> ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks .
Thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months .
Biochemical and hormonal indices of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after <START:Chemical> OCT <END> or vehicle treatment , and at the end of the crossover period .
RESULTS : In Nx dogs , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> .
In long - standing <START:Disease> secondary hyperparathyroidism <END> , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> ( 0 . 03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months .
Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control .
These effects were accompanied by episodes of <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and <START:Disease> hyperphosphatemia <END> .
In animals with normal renal function , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the doses .
In Nx dogs , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> reversed abnormal bone formation , such as <START:Disease> woven osteoid <END> and <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover .
In addition , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs .
CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that even though <START:Chemical> OCT <END> does not completely prevent the occurrence of <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> in experimental dogs with <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> , it may be of use in the management of <START:Disease> secondary hyperparathyroidism <END> because it does not induce <START:Disease> low bone turnover <END> and , therefore , does not increase the risk of <START:Disease> adynamic bone disease <END> .
Increased <START:Disease> mental slowing <END> associated with the APOE epsilon 4 allele after <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly .
OBJECTIVES : The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon 4 and subjective effects of <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> on measures reflecting sedation and <START:Disease> confusion <END> and to investigate the relationship between <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> - induced subjective effects and objective memory performance .
METHODS : This study comprised 24 cognitively intact , health elderly adults ( 12 APOE epsilon 4 carriers ) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic .
This was a randomized , double blind , placebo - controlled , three - way , crossover experimental design .
All participants received 1 . 0 mg or 2 . 0 mg <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks .
Bond and Lader ' s visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline , 1 , 2 . 5 , and 5 hours postdrug administration .
RESULTS : A 2 . 0 - mg oral dose of <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> resulted in increased subjective ratings of <START:Disease> mental slowness <END> in carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 allele only .
Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2 . 0 mg <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> and placebo on ratings of <START:Disease> mental slowness <END> significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 allele only .
However , no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear - headedness .
CONCLUSION : The epsilon 4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective <START:Disease> mental slowing <END> after <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> anticholinergic challenge .
<START:Chemical> Flurbiprofen <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Thirty - four patients with <START:Disease> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> , who were treated with <START:Chemical> flurbiprofen <END> at a maximum dose of 4 mg / kg / day , had statistically significant decreases from baseline in 6 <START:Disease> arthritis <END> indices after 12 weeks of treatment .
Improvements were seen in the number of <START:Disease> tender joints <END> , the severity of <START:Disease> swelling <END> and <START:Disease> tenderness <END> , the time of walk 50 feet , the duration of <START:Disease> morning stiffness <END> and the circumference of the left knee .
The most frequently observed side effect was <START:Disease> fecal occult blood <END> ( 25 % of patients ) ; however , there was no other evidence of <START:Disease> gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding <END> in these patients .
One patient was prematurely discontinued from the study for severe <START:Disease> headache <END> and <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> .
Most side effects were mild and related to the GI tract .
<START:Disease> Hyperkalemia <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Hyperkalemia <END> has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( NSAID ) such as <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> .
Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> , owing to its lack of interference with renal <START:Chemical> prostacyclin <END> synthesis .
We describe 4 patients in whom <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> ranging from 6 . 1 to 6 . 9 mEq / l developed within 3 to 8 days of <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> administration .
In all of them normal serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> .
As no other medications known to effect serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> had been given concomitantly , this course of events is suggestive of a cause - and - effect relationship between <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> and <START:Disease> hyperkalemia <END> .
These observations indicate that initial hopes that <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified .
Early adjuvant <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> in superficial <START:Disease> bladder carcinoma <END> .
A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell <START:Disease> carcinoma of the bladder <END> .
<START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> ( 50 mg / 50 ml ) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA - T 1 ( O - A ) <START:Disease> bladder tumors <END> .
Instillation was repeated twice during the first week , then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year .
The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients , and 29 patients presented with local side - effects .
In 24 of these patients chemical <START:Disease> cystitis <END> was severe enough for them to drop out of the study .
No systemic side - effects were observed .
Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow - up and in 72 patients followed for 2 - 3 years ( mean 32 months ) .
Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year , 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease .
Of the 82 evaluable patients , 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year ( 61 % ) , while 32 presented with one or more recurrences ( 39 % ) .
Of these recurrences , 27 were T 1 <START:Disease> tumors <END> while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions .
In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year , 80 % remained <START:Disease> tumor <END> - free during the 2 - to 3 - year follow - up period .
Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year , only 50 % presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped .
The beneficial effect of <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself , the early and repeated instillations after TUR , or both .
<START:Chemical> Sulfasalazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> lupus erythematosus <END> .
<START:Disease> Pneumonitis <END> , bilateral <START:Disease> pleural effusions <END> , echocardiographic evidence of <START:Disease> cardiac tamponade <END> , and positive autoantibodies developed in a 43 - year - old man , who was receiving long - term <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> therapy for chronic <START:Disease> ulcerative colitis <END> .
After cessation of the <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> and completion of a six - week course of corticosteroids , these problems resolved over a period of four to six months .
It is suggested that the patient had <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> lupus <END> , which manifested with <START:Disease> serositis <END> and pulmonary parenchymal involvement in the absence of joint symptoms .
Physicians who use <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> to treat patients with <START:Disease> inflammatory bowel disease <END> should be aware of the signs of <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> lupus syndrome <END> .
<START:Disease> Haemolytic - uraemic syndrome <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> .
This paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the <START:Disease> haemolytic - uraemic syndrome <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> .
These children were older and were more likely to have undergone recent bowel surgery than are other children with this condition .
While the involvement of <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> in the aetiology of the <START:Disease> haemolytic - uraemic syndrome <END> is not established firmly , the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the <START:Disease> haemolytic - uraemic syndrome <END> suggest a possible link between <START:Chemical> metronidazole <END> treatment and some cases of the <START:Disease> haemolytic - uraemic syndrome <END> .
Central <START:Disease> retinal vein occlusion <END> associated with <START:Chemical> clomiphene <END> - induced ovulation .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of central <START:Disease> retinal vein occlusion <END> associated with <START:Chemical> clomiphene citrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> CC <END> ) .
DESIGN : Case study .
SETTING : Ophthalmology clinic of an academic hospital .
PATIENT ( S ) : A 36 - year - old woman referred from the <START:Disease> infertility <END> clinic for <START:Disease> blurred vision <END> .
INTERVENTION ( S ) : Ophthalmic examination after <START:Chemical> CC <END> therapy .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE ( S ) : Central <START:Disease> retinal vein occlusion <END> after ovulation induction with <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
RESULT ( S ) : A 36 - year - old Chinese woman developed central <START:Disease> retinal vein occlusion <END> after eight courses of <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
A search of the literature on the <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> complications of <START:Chemical> CC <END> does not include this severe ophthalmic complication , although mild <START:Disease> visual disturbance <END> after <START:Chemical> CC <END> intake is not uncommon .
CONCLUSION ( S ) : This is the first reported case of central <START:Disease> retinal vein occlusion <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
Extra caution is warranted in treating <START:Disease> infertility <END> patients with <START:Chemical> CC <END> , and patients should be well informed of this side effect before commencement of therapy .
<START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> induced acute <START:Disease> choreoathetosis <END> : case report and review of the literature .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> is an <START:Chemical> oxazolidine <END> derivative that is structurally different from <START:Chemical> amphetamines <END> and used in the treatment of <START:Disease> attention deficit disorder <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> who experienced profound <START:Disease> choreoathetosis <END> .
CASE REPORT : Two , 3 - year - old male , identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> originally containing 59 tablets .
The children had a medical history significant for <START:Disease> attention deficit disorder <END> previously treated with <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> without success .
This was their first day of <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> therapy .
The <START:Disease> choreoathetoid <END> movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion .
The children gave no history of prior <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> and there was no family history of <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> in an attempt to control the <START:Disease> choreoathetoid <END> movements .
Despite treatment , the children continued to have <START:Disease> choreoathetosis <END> for approximately 24 hours .
Forty - eight hours after admission , the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> associated <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature .
The possibility of <START:Disease> choreoathetoid <END> movements should be considered in patients presenting after <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
Persistent <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> following <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic <START:Disease> dehydration <END> following a <START:Disease> head injury <END> .
Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> , and <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy had been discontinued .
He remained thirsty and <START:Disease> polyuric <END> despite cessation of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and <START:Chemical> vasopressin <END> secretion , with clear evidence of <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> induced <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but <START:Disease> polyuria <END> persisted in this patient for ten years after <START:Chemical> lithium <END> was stopped .
We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dapsone <END> - associated Heinz body <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> in a Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait .
A Cambodian woman with hemoglobin E trait ( AE ) and <START:Disease> leprosy <END> developed a Heinz body <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> while taking a dose of <START:Chemical> dapsone <END> ( 50 mg / day ) not usually associated with clinical <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> .
Her red blood cells ( RBCs ) had increased incubated Heinz body formation , decreased reduced <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> ( <START:Chemical> GSH <END> ) , and decreased <START:Chemical> GSH <END> stability .
The <START:Chemical> pentose phosphate <END> shunt activity of the <START:Chemical> dapsone <END> - exposed AE RBCs was increased compared to normal RBCs .
Although the AE RBCs from an individual not taking <START:Chemical> dapsone <END> had increased incubated Heinz body formation , the <START:Chemical> GSH <END> content and <START:Chemical> GSH <END> stability were normal .
The <START:Chemical> pentose phosphate <END> shunt activity of the non - <START:Chemical> dapsone <END> - exposed AE RBCs was decreased compared to normal RBCs .
Thus , AE RBCs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo , since <START:Chemical> dapsone <END> does not cause <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> at this dose in hematologically normal individuals .
Given the influx of Southeast Asians into the United States , oxidant medications should be used with caution , especially if an <START:Disease> infection <END> is present , in individuals of ethnic backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin E .
Clinical experiences in an open and a double - blind trial .
A total of sixty patients were trated with <START:Chemical> bromperidol <END> first in open conditions ( 20 patients ) , then on a double blind basis ( 40 patients ) with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> as the reference substance .
The open study lasted for four weeks ; the drug was administrated in the form of 1 mg tablets .
The daily dose ( initial dose : 1 mg ; mean dose at the end of the trial : 4 . 47 mg ) was always administered in one single dose .
Nineteen patients finished the trial , and in 18 cases the therapeutic result was considered very good to good .
These results were confirmed by statistical analysis .
Nine patients exhibited mild to moderate <START:Disease> extrapyramidal concomitant symptoms <END> ; no other side effects were observed .
The results of detailed laboratory tests and evaluations of various quantitative and qualitative tolerability parameters were not indicative of toxic effects .
In the double blind study with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> , both substances were found to be highly effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> psychotic syndromes belonging predominantly to the schizophrenia group <END> .
Certain clues , including the onset of action , seem to be indicative of the superiority of <START:Chemical> bromperidol <END> .
No differences were observed with respect to side effects and general tolerability .
Light chain <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and cellular mediated immunity in <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> treated patients with <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> .
Light chain <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was found in 9 of 17 <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> patients treated with <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> .
Concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different .
Response to Varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> patients tested , but there occurred a hyper - responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen ( PHA - P ) .
as well as of those of seven other <START:Disease> tuberculous <END> patients .
This last finding may be related to time of testing and / or endogenous serum binding of <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte .
<START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> - associated <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor - containing mammalian target of <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> protein kinase .
<START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
Its role in the therapy of <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> , <START:Disease> autoimmunity <END> , <START:Disease> cystic renal diseases <END> and <START:Disease> renal cancer <END> is under investigation .
Because <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' non - <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> drug ' .
However , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> is associated with <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and <START:Disease> acute renal dysfunction <END> .
A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing <START:Disease> chronic renal damage <END> .
The mechanisms of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> - associated <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .
It has also been suggested that <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive .
The <START:Disease> acute renal dysfunction <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes .
Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> on the kidney , the use of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and renal function , use of <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitors or <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> receptor blockers if <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> occurs and withdrawal if needed .
Further long - term analysis of renal allograft studies using <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future .
A novel , multiple symptom model of <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive - like behaviors <END> in animals .
BACKGROUND : Current animal models of <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive disorder <END> ( <START:Disease> OCD <END> ) typically involve acute , drug - induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or <START:Disease> anxiety <END> .
None of these current models demonstrate multiple <START:Disease> OCD <END> - like behaviors .
METHODS : Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Clomipramine <END> exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced <START:Disease> anxiety <END> ( elevated plus maze and marble burying ) , <START:Disease> behavioral inflexibility <END> ( perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning ) , working <START:Disease> memory impairment <END> ( e . g . , win - shift paradigm ) , <START:Disease> hoarding <END> , and <START:Disease> corticostriatal dysfunction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> D 2 receptors were elevated in the striatum , whereas <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 2 C , but not <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 1 A , receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex .
CONCLUSIONS : This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an <START:Disease> OCD <END> - like profile in animals .
Moreover , these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to <START:Disease> OCD <END> .
This novel model of <START:Disease> OCD <END> demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease - like systems permanently , which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other <START:Disease> psychiatric disorders <END> .
Inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs .
In six conscious , trained dogs , maintained on a normal <START:Chemical> sodium <END> intake of 2 to 4 mEq / kg / day , sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> and <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> during 15 - minute i . v . infusions of human alpha - atrial natriuretic factor .
Mean arterial pressure ( as a percentage of control + / - SEM ) during randomized infusions of 0 . 03 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 , or 1 . 0 microgram / kg / min was 99 + / - 1 , 95 + / - 1 ( p less than 0 . 05 ) , 93 + / - 1 ( p less than 0 . 01 ) , or 79 + / - 6 % ( p less than 0 . 001 ) , respectively , but no <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> and no augmentation of the <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> release rate ( up to 0 . 3 microgram / kg / min ) were observed , which is in contrast to comparable <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> hydralazine <END> or <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> .
The release rate of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ( control , 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 6 ng / kg / min ) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 + / - 5 % of control ( p less than 0 . 001 ) during 0 . 1 microgram / kg / min and to 63 + / - 5 % ( 0 . 1 greater than p greater than 0 . 05 ) or 95 + / - 13 % ( not significant ) during 0 . 3 or 1 . 0 microgram / kg / min .
Steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 + / - 10 pg / ml ( n = 6 ) during infusions of saline and 284 + / - 24 pg / ml ( n = 6 ) and 1520 + / - 300 pg / ml ( n = 9 ) during 0 . 03 and 0 . 1 microgram / kg / min infusions of the factor . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Chemical> Glyburide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Drug - induced <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , although common , has been reported only infrequently with <START:Chemical> sulfonylureas <END> .
For <START:Chemical> glyburide <END> , a second - generation <START:Chemical> sulfonylurea <END> , only two brief reports of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> exist .
Two patients with <START:Disease> type II diabetes mellitus <END> developed an <START:Disease> acute hepatitis - like syndrome <END> soon after initiation of <START:Chemical> glyburide <END> therapy .
There was no serologic evidence of <START:Disease> viral infection <END> , and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with <START:Disease> drug - induced hepatitis <END> .
Both patients recovered quickly after stopping <START:Chemical> glyburide <END> therapy and have remained well for a follow - up period of 1 year .
<START:Chemical> Glyburide <END> can produce an <START:Disease> acute hepatitis - like illness <END> in some persons .
Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> in rats .
<START:Disease> Nephrotic syndrome <END> is often accompanied by <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention and generalized <START:Disease> edema <END> .
However , the molecular basis for the decreased renal <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion remains undefined .
We hypothesized that epithelial <START:Chemical> Na <END> channel ( ENaC ) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention .
An experimental group of rats was treated with <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ; 180 mg / kg iv ) , whereas the control group received only vehicle .
After 7 days , <START:Chemical> PAN <END> treatment induced significant <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> hypoalbuminemia <END> , decreased urinary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion , and extensive <START:Disease> ascites <END> .
The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM ) and in the inner medulla ( IM ) but was not altered in the cortex .
gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex , ISOM , and IM .
Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC , beta - ENaC , and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT 2 ) , connecting tubule , and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments .
Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha - ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of <START:Chemical> PAN <END> - treated rats , indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha - ENaC subunits .
In contrast , the protein abundances of <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) / <START:Chemical> H <END> ( + ) exchanger type 3 ( NHE 3 ) , <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) - <START:Chemical> K <END> ( + ) - 2 <START:Chemical> Cl <END> ( - ) cotransporter ( BSC - 1 ) , and <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> - sensitive <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) - <START:Chemical> Cl <END> ( - ) cotransporter ( TSC ) were decreased .
Moreover , the abundance of the alpha ( 1 ) - subunit of the <START:Chemical> Na <END> - <START:Chemical> K <END> - ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM , but it remained unchanged in the IM .
In conclusion , the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT 2 , connecting tubule , and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention associated with <START:Chemical> PAN <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
The decreased abundance of NHE 3 , BSC - 1 , TSC , and <START:Chemical> Na <END> - <START:Chemical> K <END> - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion .
Nerve growth factor and <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> in the urine of female patients with <START:Disease> overactive bladder <END> .
PURPOSE : NGF and <START:Chemical> PGs <END> in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine .
We investigated changes in urinary NGF and <START:Chemical> PGs <END> in women with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study groups included 65 women with <START:Disease> OAB <END> and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls .
Evaluation included patient history , urinalysis , a voiding diary and urodynamic studies .
Urine samples were collected .
NGF , <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> , <START:Chemical> PGF 2 alpha <END> and <START:Chemical> PGI 2 <END> were measured using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups .
In addition , correlations between urinary NGF and <START:Chemical> PG <END> , and urodynamic parameters in patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> were examined .
RESULTS : Urinary NGF , <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> PGF 2 alpha <END> were significantly increased in patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> compared with controls ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
However , urinary <START:Chemical> PGI 2 <END> was not different between controls and patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
In patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> urinary <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Urinary NGF , <START:Chemical> PGF 2 alpha <END> and <START:Chemical> PGI 2 <END> did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : NGF and <START:Chemical> PGs <END> have important roles in the development of <START:Disease> OAB <END> symptoms in female patients .
Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate <START:Disease> OAB <END> symptoms .
Fatal <START:Disease> haemorrhagic myocarditis <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Haemorrhagic myocarditis <END> is a rare but important complication of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy .
Echocardiographic identification of the disorder can be made .
We believe that the ultrasound features of this disorder have not been previously reported .
Peripheral <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> induced <START:Disease> degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <END> in rat substantia nigra .
<START:Chemical> Iron <END> accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral <START:Chemical> iron <END> overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( SN ) , in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry , <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry , Perls ' <START:Chemical> iron <END> staining , and high performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detection to study the <START:Disease> degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <END> and increased <START:Chemical> iron <END> content in the SN of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> overloaded animals .
The findings showed that peripheral <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> overload increased the <START:Chemical> iron <END> staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH - immunoreactive neurons in the SN .
As a result , <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> release and content , as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen .
Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group .
These results suggest that peripheral <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> can increase the <START:Chemical> iron <END> level in the SN , where excessive <START:Chemical> iron <END> causes the <START:Disease> degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <END> .
The chronic <START:Chemical> iron <END> overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute <START:Chemical> iron <END> overload .
<START:Disease> Toxic hepatitis <END> induced by antithyroid drugs : four cases including one with cross - reactivity between <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> and <START:Chemical> benzylthiouracil <END> .
OBJECTIVE : This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of <START:Disease> hepatic adverse effects <END> encountered with antithyroid drugs .
METHODS : Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> admitted in our department ( in - or out - patients ) from 1986 to 1992 .
RESULTS : Four patients ( 1 . 7 % ) were identified with <START:Disease> toxic hepatitis <END> which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent .
Two patients had a <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> ( <START:Chemical> N omercazole <END> ) .
Two others had a mixed ( <START:Disease> cholestatic <END> and cytolytic ) <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> following <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> .
One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> which appeared after <START:Chemical> Benzylthiouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> Basd ne <END> ) had replaced <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> .
Biological features of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug , while biliary , viral and immunological searches were negative .
Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> .
CONCLUSION : <START:Disease> Toxic hepatitis <END> is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants , as for haematological disturbances , a pre - therapeutic determination and a careful follow - up of relevant biological markers .
Moreover , <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents .
Safety and side - effects of <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> .
Controlled study in <START:Disease> agoraphobia <END> with <START:Disease> panic disorder <END> .
BACKGROUND : The widespread use of <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects .
The efficacy of <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> and placebo in <START:Disease> panic disorder <END> with <START:Disease> agoraphobia <END> , and the side - effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured .
METHOD : In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM - III criteria for <START:Disease> panic disorder <END> with <START:Disease> agoraphobia <END> were randomised to <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> or placebo .
Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation .
Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16 .
RESULTS : Mean <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> dose was 5 mg daily .
Compared with placebo subjects , <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> patients developed more adverse reactions ( 21 % v . 0 % ) of <START:Disease> depression <END> , <START:Disease> enuresis <END> , disinhibition and <START:Disease> aggression <END> ; and more side - effects , particularly sedation , <START:Disease> irritability <END> , <START:Disease> impaired memory <END> , <START:Disease> weight loss <END> and <START:Disease> ataxia <END> .
Side - effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8 .
Despite this , the drop - out rate was low .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Alprazolam <END> caused side - effects and adverse effects during treatment but many patients were willing to accept these .
<START:Disease> Graft - versus - host disease <END> prophylaxis with <START:Chemical> everolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> is associated with a high incidence of <START:Disease> sinusoidal obstruction syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> microangiopathy <END> : results of the EVTAC trial .
A calcineurin inhibitor combined with <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> is the standard prophylaxis for <START:Disease> graft - versus - host disease <END> ( <START:Disease> GVHD <END> ) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) .
<START:Chemical> Everolimus <END> , a derivative of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> , seems to mediate antileukemia effects .
We report on a combination of <START:Chemical> everolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> in 24 patients ( median age , 62 years ) with either <START:Disease> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> MDS <END> ; n = 17 ) or <START:Disease> acute myeloid leukemia <END> ( <START:Disease> AML <END> ; n = 7 ) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related ( n = 4 ) or unrelated ( n = 20 ) donors .
All patients engrafted , and only 1 patient experienced grade IV <START:Disease> mucositis <END> .
Nine patients ( 37 % ) developed acute grade II - IV <START:Disease> GVHD <END> , and 11 of 17 evaluable patients ( 64 % ) developed chronic extensive <START:Disease> GVHD <END> .
<START:Disease> Transplantation - associated microangiopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> TMA <END> ) occurred in 7 patients ( 29 % ) , with 2 cases of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients ( 25 % ) developed <START:Disease> sinusoidal obstruction syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> SOS <END> ) , which was fatal in 2 cases .
With a median follow - up of 26 months , the 2 - year overall survival rate was 47 % .
Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute <START:Disease> GVHD <END> , the incidence of <START:Disease> TMA <END> and <START:Disease> SOS <END> is considerably higher than seen with other regimens .
An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by <START:Chemical> mepivacaine <END> with <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> .
An <START:Disease> increase in blood pressure <END> , accompanied by <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> , <START:Disease> agitation <END> , <START:Disease> incomprehensible shouts <END> and <START:Disease> loss of consciousness <END> , was observed in an elderly , ASA classification group II , cardiovascularly medicated male , 12 min after performance of axillary block with <START:Chemical> mepivacaine <END> 850 mg containing <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> 0 . 225 mg , for correction of <START:Disease> Dupuytren ' s contracture <END> .
After intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> the patient ' s condition improved , and 15 min later he woke up .
The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> .
Postoperatively , the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically .
Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of <START:Chemical> mepivacaine <END> with <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> and / or interaction of these drugs with the patient ' s cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications .
Effects of <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> , <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> , and <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> on <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> in dogs .
A reproducible model for producing diffuse <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> ( <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> infusion ) has been developed to study the cardioprotective effects of agents or maneuvers which might alter the evolution of acute <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
Infusions of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ( 4 mug per kilogram per minute for 6 hours ) increased <START:Chemical> radiocalcium <END> uptakes into intact myocardium and each of its subcellular components with the mitochondrial fraction showing the most consistent changes when compared to saline - infused control animals ( 4 , 957 vs . 827 counts per minute per gram of dried tissue or fraction ) .
Myocardial concentrations of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> also increased significantly ( 12 . 0 vs . 5 . 0 mg . per 100 Gm . of fat - free dry weight ) .
Infusions of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> sufficient to raise serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> concentrations 2 mEq . per liter failed to increase <START:Chemical> calcium <END> influx into the myocardial cell .
Mitochondrial <START:Chemical> radiocalcium <END> uptakes were significantly decreased in animals pretreated with <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> or <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> or when <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> was added to the <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> infusion ( 2 , 682 , 2 , 803 , and 3 , 424 counts per minute per gram of dried fraction , respectively ) .
Myocardial <START:Chemical> calcium <END> concentrations also were decreased ( 11 . 2 , 8 . 3 , and 8 . 9 mg . per 100 Gm . of fat - free dry weight , respectively ) in the three treatment groups , being significantly decreased only in the last two .
Evidence of microscopic damage was graded as less severe in the three treatment groups .
<START:Chemical> Acetylsalicylic acid <END> , <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> , and <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> all appear to have cardioprotective effects when tested in this model .
The site of common side effects of <START:Chemical> sumatriptan <END> .
<START:Disease> Atypical sensations <END> following the use of subcutaneous <START:Chemical> sumatriptan <END> are common , but of uncertain origin .
They are almost always benign , but can be mistaken for a serious adverse event by the patient .
Two patients are presented with <START:Disease> tingling or burning sensations <END> limited to areas of heat exposure or <START:Disease> sunburn <END> .
In these individuals , side effects are most likely generated superficially in the skin .
Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic <START:Chemical> steroid <END> exposure in male rats with low <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> .
The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic <START:Chemical> steroid <END> ( AAS ) exposure and brain <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamine <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats .
<START:Chemical> Serotonin <END> was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with <START:Chemical> parachlorophenylalanine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> 100 mg / kg , every other day ) ; controls received saline .
At puberty ( P 40 ) , half the <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> - treated rats and half the saline - treated rats began treatment with <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> T <END> , 5 mg / kg , 5 days / week ) .
Behavioral measures included locomotion , <START:Disease> irritability <END> , copulation , partner preference , and <START:Disease> aggression <END> .
Animals were tested for <START:Disease> aggression <END> in their home cage , both with and without physical provocation ( mild tail pinch ) .
Brain levels of <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> and its metabolite , <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HIAA <END> ) , were determined using HPLC .
<START:Chemical> PCPA <END> significantly and substantially depleted <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> and <START:Chemical> 5 - HIAA <END> in all brain regions examined .
Chronic <START:Chemical> T <END> treatment significantly decreased <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> and <START:Chemical> 5 - HIAA <END> in certain brain areas , but to a much lesser extent than <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> .
Chronic exposure to <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased <START:Disease> irritability <END> but had no effect on sexual behavior , partner preference , or <START:Disease> aggression <END> .
<START:Chemical> T <END> alone had no effect on locomotion , <START:Disease> irritability <END> , or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and <START:Disease> aggression <END> .
The most striking effect of combining <START:Chemical> T <END> + <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack , particularly following physical provocation .
Based on these data , it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> may be especially prone to exhibit <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> .
Predictors of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in patients with <START:Disease> heart failure <END> during <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy : results from the studies of <START:Disease> left ventricular dysfunction <END> ( SOLVD )
BACKGROUND : Although <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) , it may also cause <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> .
Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication .
OBJECTIVE : To quantify specific clinical predictors of <START:Disease> reduction in renal function <END> in patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> who are prescribed <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy .
METHOD : We analyzed data from the Studies of <START:Disease> Left Ventricular Dysfunction <END> ( SOLVD ) , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> for the treatment of <START:Disease> CHF <END> .
There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> with a median follow - up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow - up of 967 days .
<START:Disease> Decreased renal function <END> was defined as a rise in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> > / = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 micromol / L ) from baseline .
We used time - to - event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age , baseline ejection fraction , baseline <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , low systolic blood pressure ( < 100 mm Hg ) , history of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , and use of antiplatelet , <START:Chemical> diuretic <END> , and beta - blocker therapy .
RESULTS : Patients randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> had a 33 % greater likelihood of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> than controls ( P = . 003 ) .
By multivariate analysis , in both the placebo and <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> groups older age , <START:Chemical> diuretic <END> therapy , and <START:Disease> diabetes <END> were associated with <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> , whereas beta - blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective .
Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in both groups , but significantly more so in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> group ( <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> : risk ratio [ RR ] 1 . 42 per 10 years , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 - 1 . 52 with <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> ; placebo : RR 1 . 18 , 95 % CI 1 . 12 - 1 . 25 ) .
<START:Chemical> Diuretic <END> therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> group ( RR 1 . 89 , 95 % CI 1 . 70 - 2 . 08 ) than in the placebo group ( RR 1 . 35 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 - 1 . 66 ) .
Conversely , <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> had a relative renoprotective effect ( RR 1 . 33 , 95 % CI 1 . 13 - 1 . 53 ) compared with placebo ( RR 1 . 96 , 95 % CI 1 . 57 - 2 . 44 ) in patients with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> .
A lower risk of <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> was seen in both groups with beta - blocker therapy ( RR 0 . 70 , 95 % CI 0 . 57 - 0 . 85 ) and higher baseline ejection fraction ( RR 0 . 93 per 5 % increment , 95 % CI 0 . 91 - 0 .
96 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Enalapril <END> use caused a 33 % increase in the risk of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> .
<START:Chemical> Diuretic <END> use and advanced age increased this risk .
<START:Disease> Diabetes <END> was associated with an increased risk of <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> in all patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> , but this risk was reduced in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> group compared with the placebo group .
beta - Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy .
Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> in humans .
BACKGROUND : Preclinical studies of intrathecal <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> suggest it may be effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> acute and chronic pain <END> in humans , and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> suggests it may be effective in <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> states but not with acute noxious stimulation .
The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> marketed in the US , using both acute noxious stimulation and <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - evoked mechanical <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> .
METHODS : Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent , 65 volunteers were studied in two trials : an open - label , dose - escalating trial with intrathecal <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> doses of 0 . 25 - 2 . 0 mg and a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> , 2 mg . Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis , and <START:Disease> pain <END> ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of <START:Disease> mechanical hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> allodynia <END> after intradermal <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> injection were determined .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Adenosine <END> produced no effect on <START:Disease> pain <END> report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced <START:Disease> mechanical hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> allodynia <END> from intradermal <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> injection for at least 24 h .
In contrast , residence time of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h ) .
CONCLUSIONS : These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> of <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> , presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> injection .
The long - lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> and is not due to prolonged residence of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> in cerebrospinal fluid .
Repeated transient <START:Disease> anuria <END> following <START:Chemical> losartan <END> administration in a patient with a solitary kidney .
We report the case of a 70 - year - old <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> man with a solitary kidney and <START:Disease> chronic renal insufficiency <END> who developed two episodes of transient <START:Disease> anuria <END> after <START:Chemical> losartan <END> administration .
He was hospitalized for a <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> with <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> , treated with high - dose diuretics .
Due to severe <START:Disease> systolic dysfunction <END> <START:Chemical> losartan <END> was prescribed .
Surprisingly , the first dose of 50 mg of <START:Chemical> losartan <END> resulted in a sudden <START:Disease> anuria <END> , which lasted eight hours despite high - dose <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> and <START:Chemical> amine <END> infusion .
One week later , by mistake , <START:Chemical> losartan <END> was prescribed again and after the second dose of 50 mg , the patient developed a second episode of transient <START:Disease> anuria <END> lasting 10 hours .
During these two episodes , his blood pressure diminished but no severe <START:Disease> hypotension <END> was noted .
Ultimately , an arteriography showed a 70 - 80 % <START:Disease> renal artery stenosis <END> .
In this patient , <START:Disease> renal artery stenosis <END> combined with <START:Disease> heart failure <END> and diuretic therapy certainly resulted in a strong activation of the renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system ( RAS ) .
Under such conditions , <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> receptor blockade by <START:Chemical> losartan <END> probably induced a critical fall in glomerular filtration pressure .
This case report highlights the fact that the <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> losartan <END> can cause serious unexpected complications in patients with <START:Disease> renovascular disease <END> and should be used with extreme caution in this setting .
Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> discharges in <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> model in rats .
AIM : Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity , but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined .
The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity in <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> model .
MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes .
In group - 1 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185 Hz , 0 . 5 V , 1 V , 2 V , and 5 V for 60 sec ) following <START:Chemical> penicillin G <END> injection intracortically .
In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8 l saline injection intracortically .
EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following <START:Chemical> penicillin - G <END> injection , and at 10 th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency , amplitude , and power spectrum .
RESULTS : High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity independent from stimulus intensity .
In the control group , hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5 V stimulation .
CONCLUSION : Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity effectively without causing secondary <START:Disease> epileptic <END> discharges .
These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemolytic anemia <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> omeprazole <END> .
<START:Chemical> Omeprazole <END> is the first drug designed to block the final step in the acid secretory process within the parietal cell .
It has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> peptic ulcer disease <END> , <START:Disease> reflux esophagitis <END> , and the <START:Disease> Zollinger - Ellison syndrome <END> .
Although clinical experience with <START:Chemical> omeprazole <END> is still limited , many controlled studies have established the short - term safety of this drug .
We report the first case of a serious short - term adverse reaction with the use of <START:Chemical> omeprazole <END> : <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
The patient developed weakness , <START:Disease> lethargy <END> , and <START:Disease> shortness of breath <END> 2 days after starting therapy with <START:Chemical> omeprazole <END> .
Two weeks after the initiation of therapy , her hematocrit had decreased from 44 . 1 % to 20 . 4 % , and she had a positive direct Coombs antiglobulin test and an elevated indirect <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> .
After she discontinued the <START:Chemical> omeprazole <END> , her hemoglobin and hematocrit gradually returned to normal .
The mechanism by which <START:Chemical> omeprazole <END> caused the patient ' s <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> is uncertain , but physicians should be alerted to this possible adverse effect .
Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to <START:Chemical> beta - carboline <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) receptor ligands .
Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity ( BS line ) or resistance ( BR line ) to <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by a single i . p . injection of <START:Chemical> methyl beta - carboline - 3 - carboxylate <END> ( <START:Chemical> beta - CCM <END> ) , an inverse agonist of the <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) receptor <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> site .
Our aim was to characterize both lines ' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) receptor .
We measured <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus - maze test , <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced sedation by recording the vigilance states , and <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> - and <START:Chemical> pentylenetetrazol <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> after i . p . injections .
Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to <START:Chemical> beta - CCM <END> can be extended to <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> , and <START:Chemical> pentylenetetrazol <END> , suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) receptor .
Late <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> after treatment for a malignant <START:Disease> bone tumor <END> .
Cardiac function was assessed in long - term survivors of malignant <START:Disease> bone tumors <END> who were treated according to <START:Chemical> Rosen ' s T 5 or T 10 protocol <END> , both including <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
Thirty - one patients , age 10 - 45 years ( median age 17 . 8 years ) were evaluated 2 . 3 - 14 . 1 years ( median 8 . 9 years ) following completion of treatment .
Cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> were 225 - 550 mg / m 2 ( median dose 360 ) .
The evaluation consisted of a history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , signal averaged ECG , 24 - hour ambulatory ECG , echocardiography and radionuclide angiography .
Eighteen of 31 ( 58 % ) patients showed <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> , defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities : late potentials , complex <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> , left <START:Disease> ventricular dilation <END> , decreased shortening fraction , or decreased ejection fraction .
The incidence of <START:Disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> increased with length of follow - up ( P < or = . 05 ) .
No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and cardiac status , except for heart rate variability .
When adjusted to body surface area , the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW index ) was decreased in all patients .
The incidence of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> is high and increases with follow - up , irrespective of cumulative dose .
Life - long cardiac follow - up in these patients is warranted .
The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Twin preterm neonates with <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> related to <START:Chemical> lopinavir / ritonavir <END> therapy .
We report twin neonates who were born prematurely at 32 weeks of gestation to a mother with <START:Disease> human immunodeficiency virus infection <END> .
One of the twins developed complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> and <START:Disease> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> related to <START:Chemical> lopinavir / ritonavir <END> therapy , a boosted protease - inhibitor agent , while the other twin developed mild <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
We recommend caution in the use of <START:Chemical> lopinavir / ritonavir <END> in the immediate neonatal period .
Prolonged elevation of plasma <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> in a cardiac transplant patient with a suspected history of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> with <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
BACKGROUND : Direct thrombin inhibitors ( DTIs ) provide an alternative method of anticoagulation for patients with a history of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ( <START:Disease> HIT <END> ) or <START:Disease> HIT <END> with <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> ( <START:Disease> HITT <END> ) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .
In the following report , a 65 - year - old <START:Disease> critically ill <END> patient with a suspected history of <START:Disease> HITT <END> was administered <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> for anticoagulation on bypass during heart transplantation .
The patient required massive transfusion support ( 55 units of red blood cells , 42 units of fresh - frozen plasma , 40 units of cryoprecipitate , 40 units of platelets , and three doses of recombinant Factor VIIa ) for severe <START:Disease> intraoperative and postoperative bleeding <END> .
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Plasma samples from before and after CPB were analyzed postoperatively for <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> concentration using a modified ecarin clotting time ( ECT ) assay .
RESULTS : Unexpectedly high concentrations of <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> were measured in these samples ( range , 0 - 32 microg / mL ) , and a prolonged plasma <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> half life ( t ( 1 / 2 )) of 514 minutes was observed ( published elimination t ( 1 / 2 ) is 39 - 51 minutes [ < or = 181 minutes with <START:Disease> hepatic impairment <END> ] ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Correlation of plasma <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> concentration versus the patient ' s coagulation variables and clinical course suggest that prolonged elevated levels of plasma <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> may have contributed to the patient ' s extended <START:Disease> coagulopathy <END> .
Because DTIs do not have reversal agents , surgical teams and transfusion services should remain aware of the possibility of massive transfusion events during anticoagulation with these agents .
This is the first report to measure plasma <START:Chemical> argatroban <END> concentration in the context of CPB and extended <START:Disease> coagulopathy <END> .
Changes of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> and <START:Chemical> ATP <END> affinities of the cardiac ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> , <START:Chemical> K <END> ) - ATPase during and after <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> deficient <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
In the cardiovascular system , <START:Chemical> NO <END> is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions .
Inhibition of <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthesis induces sustained <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
In several models of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , elevation of intracellular <START:Chemical> sodium <END> level was documented in cardiac tissue .
To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of <START:Chemical> Na <END> + , we studied the response of cardiac ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> , <START:Chemical> K <END> ) - ATPase to <START:Chemical> NO <END> - deficient <START:Disease> hypertension <END> induced in rats by <START:Chemical> NO <END> - synthase inhibition with 40 mg / kg / day <START:Chemical> N ( G ) - nitro - L - arginine methyl ester <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ) for 4 four weeks .
After 4 - week administration of <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> , the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 36 % .
Two weeks after terminating the treatment , the SBP recovered to control value .
When activating the ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> , <START:Chemical> K <END> ) - ATPase with its substrate <START:Chemical> ATP <END> , no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in <START:Chemical> NO <END> - deficient rats .
During activation with <START:Chemical> Na <END> + , the Vmax remained unchanged , however the <START:Chemical> K <END> ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> ) increased by 50 % , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the <START:Chemical> Na <END> + - binding site in <START:Chemical> NO <END> - deficient rats .
After recovery from <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , the activity of ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> , <START:Chemical> K <END> ) - ATPase increased , due to higher affinity of the <START:Chemical> ATP <END> - binding site , as revealed from the lowered Km value for <START:Chemical> ATP <END> .
The <START:Chemical> K <END> ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> ) value for <START:Chemical> Na <END> + returned to control value .
Inhibition of <START:Chemical> NO <END> - synthase induced a reversible <START:Disease> hypertension <END> accompanied by <START:Disease> depressed <END> <START:Chemical> Na <END> + - extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated <START:Chemical> Na <END> + - binding properties of the ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> , <START:Chemical> K <END> ) - ATPase .
After recovery of blood pressure to control values , the extrusion of <START:Chemical> Na <END> + from cardiac cells was normalized , as revealed by restoration of the ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> , <START:Chemical> K <END> ) - ATPase activity .
Long - term efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of high - dose <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> therapy for <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> was administered to 154 patients who had sustained , symptomatic <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( <START:Disease> VT <END> ) ( n = 118 ) or a <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> ( n = 36 ) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs .
The loading dose was 800 mg / day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg / day .
Sixty - nine percent of patients continued treatment with <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> and had no recurrence of symptomatic <START:Disease> VT <END> or <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> ( <START:Disease> VF <END> ) over a follow - up of 6 to 52 months ( mean + / - standard deviation 14 . 2 + / - 8 . 2 ) .
Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of <START:Disease> VT <END> and were successfully managed by continuing <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug .
One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51 % of patients .
Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> in 41 % and discontinuation of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> in 10 % of patients .
The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were <START:Disease> tremor <END> or <START:Disease> ataxia <END> ( 35 % ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> anorexia <END> ( 8 % ) , <START:Disease> visual halos or blurring <END> ( 6 % ) , <START:Disease> thyroid function abnormalities <END> ( 6 % ) and <START:Disease> pulmonary interstitial infiltrates <END> ( 5 % ) .
Although large - dose <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> is highly effective in the long - term treatment of <START:Disease> VT <END> or <START:Disease> VF <END> refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs , it causes significant <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in approximately 50 % of patients .
However , when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects , 75 % of patients with <START:Disease> VT <END> or <START:Disease> VF <END> can be successfully managed with <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> resulting from a <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 40 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> major depression <END> took an <START:Disease> overdose <END> of <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> in an apparent suicide attempt .
After the ingestion of 26 <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> 50 - mg tablets , the patient experienced a witnessed generalized <START:Disease> seizure <END> .
She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit , <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> was discontinued , and no further sequelae were seen .
DISCUSSION : To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> that resulted in a generalized <START:Disease> seizure <END> .
Based on nonoverdose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> and the potential risks of available interventions , no emergent therapy was instituted .
CONCLUSIONS : The <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> in our patient resulted in a single episode of generalized <START:Disease> seizure <END> but elicited no further sequelae .
Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) in <START:Disease> arteritis <END> induced in rats by <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> and <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> , vasodilators .
<START:Disease> Arteritis <END> induced in rats by vasodilators , <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> and <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> , was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) .
Rats were administered <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> .
Irrespective of <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> administration , iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on day 5 and 8 post - <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> - infusion ( DPI ) ; bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI ; TGF - beta 1 antigens were observed in ED - 1 - positive cells on and after 5 DPI .
These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen , and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat <START:Disease> arteritis <END> models .
On the other hand , TGF - beta 1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models .
The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> .
1 . The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats were investigated .
2 .
<START:Disease> Diabetes <END> of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition ; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment .
3 .
Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats to nerve stimulation , <START:Chemical> ATP <END> , and <START:Chemical> bethanechol <END> .
4 . <START:Disease> Diabetes <END> of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight , and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition , effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study .
5 .
Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats to nerve stimulation , <START:Chemical> ATP <END> , and <START:Chemical> bethanechol <END> .
6 .
The data indicate that the effects of <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes <END> on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment .
<START:Chemical> Ketoconazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurologic sequelae <END> .
A 77 - y - old patient developed <START:Disease> weakness of extremities <END> , <START:Disease> legs paralysis <END> , <START:Disease> dysarthria <END> and <START:Disease> tremor <END> 1 h after ingestion of 200 mg <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> for the first time in his life .
All complaints faded away within 24 h .
Few days later , the patient used another 200 mg <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> tablet , and within an hour experienced a similar clinical picture , which resolved again spontaneously within hours .
Laboratory evaluations , including head CT scan , were normal .
This case illustrates the need for close vigilance in <START:Disease> adverse drug reactions <END> , particularly in the elderly .
The effect of treatment with <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> on <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in rats : a preliminary study .
In the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> on <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> induced by <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> GM <END> ) <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
Rats were treated with the vehicle ( 2 mL / kg of distilled water and 5 % w / v cellulose , 10 days ) , <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> ( 2 mL / kg of a 10 % w / v aqueous suspension of <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> powder , orally for 10 days ) , or <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> concomitantly with <START:Chemical> GM <END> ( 80 mg / kg / day intramuscularly , during the last six days of the treatment period ) .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> was assessed by measuring the concentrations of <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and <START:Chemical> urea <END> in the plasma and reduced <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> ( <START:Chemical> GSH <END> ) in the kidney cortex , and by light microscopic examination of kidney sections .
The results indicated that concomitant treatment with <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> and <START:Chemical> GM <END> significantly increased <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and <START:Chemical> urea <END> by about 183 and 239 % , respectively ( compared to 432 and 346 % , respectively , in rats treated with cellulose and <START:Chemical> GM <END> ) , and decreased that of cortical <START:Chemical> GSH <END> by 21 % ( compared to 27 % in the cellulose plus <START:Chemical> GM <END> group ) The <START:Chemical> GM <END> - induced proximal <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given <START:Chemical> GM <END> together with <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> than in those given <START:Chemical> GM <END> and cellulose .
It could be inferred that <START:Chemical> gum Arabic <END> treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of <START:Chemical> GM <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
Further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> , and on the mechanism ( s ) involved .
Recovery of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - associated <START:Disease> brachial neuritis <END> after conversion to <START:Chemical> everolimus <END> in a pediatric renal transplant recipient -- case report and review of the literature .
<START:Chemical> TAC <END> has been shown to be a potent immunosuppressive agent for solid organ transplantation in pediatrics .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxicity <END> is a potentially serious toxic effect .
It is characterized by <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> , <START:Disease> headaches <END> , <START:Disease> seizures <END> , or <START:Disease> neurological deficits <END> .
Here , we describe an eight - and - a - half - yr - old male renal transplant recipient with right BN .
MRI demonstrated hyperintense T 2 signals in the cervical cord and right brachial plexus roots indicative of both <START:Disease> myelitis <END> and right <START:Disease> brachial plexitis <END> .
Symptoms persisted for three months despite <START:Chemical> TAC <END> dose reduction , administration of IVIG and four doses of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> pulse therapy .
Improvement and eventually full recovery only occurred after <START:Chemical> TAC <END> was completely discontinued and successfully replaced by <START:Chemical> everolimus <END> .
Fatal excited <START:Disease> delirium <END> following <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use : epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
We describe an outbreak of deaths from <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced excited <START:Disease> delirium <END> ( <START:Disease> EDDs <END> ) in Dade County , Florida between 1979 and 1990 .
From a registry of all <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - related deaths in Dade County , Florida , from 1969 - 1990 , 58 <START:Disease> EDDs <END> were compared with 125 victims of accidental <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> without excited <START:Disease> delirium <END> .
Compared with controls , <START:Disease> EDDs <END> were more frequently black , male , and younger .
They were less likely to have a low body mass index , and more likely to have died in police custody , to have received medical treatment immediately before death , to have survived for a longer period , to have developed <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> , and to have died in summer months .
<START:Disease> EDDs <END> had concentrations of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls .
The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use disrupts dopaminergic function and , when coupled with recent <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use , may precipitate <START:Disease> agitation <END> , <START:Disease> delirium <END> , aberrant thermoregulation , <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> , and <START:Disease> sudden death <END> .
Interaction between <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> and <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> : case series .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> is the most widely used oral anticoagulant and is indicated for many clinical conditions .
<START:Chemical> Levofloxacin <END> , a <START:Chemical> fluoroquinolone <END> , is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics in clinical practice and is effective against Gram - positive , Gram - negative , and atypical bacteria .
While small prospective studies have not revealed any significant drug - drug interaction between <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> and <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> , several case reports have indicated that <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> may significantly potentiate the anticoagulation effect of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
We report 3 cases of serious <START:Disease> bleeding <END> complications that appear to be the result of the interaction between <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> and <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> .
Physicians should be aware of this potential interaction and use caution when prescribing <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> to patients taking <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
<START:Disease> Epileptic seizures <END> following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing <START:Chemical> tranexamic acid <END> in rats .
BACKGROUND : Fibrin sealants ( FS ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery .
In order to increase clot stability , FS typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor .
Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as <START:Chemical> tranexamic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .
However , <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> has been shown to cause <START:Disease> epileptic seizures <END> .
We wanted to study whether <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> retains its <START:Disease> convulsive <END> action if incorporated into a FS .
METHOD : FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats .
The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia .
FINDINGS : FS containing <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct <START:Disease> convulsive <END> behaviours .
The degree of these <START:Disease> seizures <END> increased with increasing concentration of <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> .
Thus , FS containing 47 . 5 mg / ml <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> evoked <START:Disease> generalized seizures <END> in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated <START:Disease> convulsive <END> potentials in 1 of 6 rats .
In contrast , FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity .
INTERPRETATION : <START:Chemical> Tranexamic acid <END> retains its <START:Disease> convulsive <END> action within FS .
Thus , use of FS containing <START:Chemical> tAMCA <END> for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient .
Down - regulation of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> transporter function induced by chronic administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local - anesthetics - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and the counteraction by co - administration with local anesthetics .
Alterations of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> transporter ( NET ) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to <START:Disease> seizures <END> induce by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and local anesthetics were studied in mice .
Daily administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> , an inhibitor of the NET , for 5 days decreased [ ( 3 ) H ] <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> uptake in the P 2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex , striatum or amygdalae .
Co - administration of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> , <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> or <START:Chemical> tricaine <END> with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> reversed this effect .
Daily treatment of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> increased [ ( 3 ) H ] <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> uptake into the hippocampus .
Daily administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> increased the incidence of appearance of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and decreased that of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Co - administration of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> reversed the changes of <START:Disease> convulsive <END> activity of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> induced by repeated administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> .
These results suggest that down - regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> may be relevant to <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> - induced sensitization of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Inhibition of <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) channels by local anesthetics may regulate <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> - induced down - regulation of NET function .
Repeated administration of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> induces up - regulation of hippocampal NET function .
<START:Chemical> Desipramine <END> - induced sensitization of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Triazolam <END> - induced brief episodes of secondary <START:Disease> mania <END> in a <START:Disease> depressed <END> patient .
Large doses of <START:Chemical> triazolam <END> repeatedly induced brief episodes of <START:Disease> mania <END> in a <START:Disease> depressed <END> elderly woman .
Features of <START:Disease> organic mental disorder <END> ( <START:Disease> delirium <END> ) were not present .
<START:Disease> Manic <END> excitement was coincident with the duration of action of <START:Chemical> triazolam <END> .
The possible contribution of the <START:Chemical> triazolo <END> group to changes in affective status is discussed .
Prevention of <START:Disease> seizures <END> and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> .
In this study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells ( BMCs ) in a model of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> in rats .
BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( <START:Disease> SE <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Spontaneous recurrent seizures <END> ( <START:Disease> SRS <END> ) were monitored using Racine ' s <START:Disease> seizure <END> severity scale .
All of the rats in the saline - treated <START:Disease> epileptic <END> control group developed <START:Disease> SRS <END> , whereas none of the BMC - treated <START:Disease> epileptic <END> animals had <START:Disease> seizures <END> in the short term ( 15 days after transplantation ) , regardless of the BMC source .
Over the long - term chronic phase ( 120 days after transplantation ) , only 25 % of BMC - treated <START:Disease> epileptic <END> animals had <START:Disease> seizures <END> , but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the <START:Disease> epileptic <END> control group .
The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved .
At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral - CA 1 synapses , long - term potentiation was preserved in BMC - transplanted rats compared to <START:Disease> epileptic <END> controls .
The donor - derived GFP ( + ) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted <START:Disease> epileptic <END> rats .
In conclusion , treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic <START:Disease> seizures <END> , reduce <START:Disease> neuronal loss <END> , and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network .
Can <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> reduce <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> induced <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> ?
This study was undertaken to determine the effect of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> pretreatment on reduction of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myalgia <END> in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery .
One hundred and thirty - five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective , double blind , randomized manner .
Group PS , the control group , received normal saline and <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) ; Group LS , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) and <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) ; Group PR , normal saline and <START:Chemical> rocuronium <END> 0 . 6 mg x kg ( - 1 ) .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> 0 . 1 mg x kg ( - 1 ) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor , ECG and pulse oximetry .
Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg . kg ( - 1 ) <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> iv .
followed by <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> ( Group PS , LS ) or <START:Chemical> rocuronium <END> ( Group PR ) for tracheal intubation .
Following administration of these agents , the presence , and degree of <START:Disease> fasciculation <END> were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered .
The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions .
Twenty - four hours later , any <START:Disease> myalgia <END> experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management .
The results indicate that <START:Disease> muscle fasciculation <END> was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of <START:Disease> muscle fasciculation <END> than those in Group PS ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
At 24 h , the incidence of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
A correlation was not found between the incidence of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> and the occurrence of <START:Disease> muscle fasciculation <END> .
The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups .
In conclusion , where <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> is used , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute psychosis <END> due to treatment with <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> in a nonepileptic patient .
The development of <START:Disease> psychosis <END> related to antiepileptic drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the <START:Disease> epileptic <END> brain substratum and the antiepileptic drugs .
The case of a nonepileptic patient who developed <START:Disease> psychosis <END> following <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> treatment for <START:Disease> trigeminal neuralgia <END> is described .
This case suggests that the <START:Disease> psychotic symptoms <END> that occur following <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> treatment in some <START:Disease> epileptic <END> patients may be the direct result of medication , unrelated to <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Reversal of <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> in rats by <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> : a peripheral effect .
<START:Chemical> Ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1 . 7 mmol <START:Chemical> NH 4 CL <END> .
This <START:Disease> coma <END> was prevented with 1 . 68 mmol <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the <START:Chemical> ammonium salt <END> injection .
The effect of <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> , an increase in brain <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> , and an increase in renal excretion of <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> and <START:Chemical> urea <END> .
Intraventricular infusion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> sufficient to raise the brain <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> to the same extent did not prevent the <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> nor affect the blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> concentrations .
Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> on blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> and the <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> was not prevented .
Thus , the reduction in blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> and the prevention of <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> after <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> , can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> on renal function rather than its central action .
These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some <START:Disease> encephalopathic <END> patients receiving <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> .
<START:Disease> Cauda equina syndrome <END> after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> : a review of six cases of <START:Disease> cauda equina syndrome <END> reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993 - 1997 .
Six cases of <START:Disease> cauda equina syndrome <END> with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993 - 1997 .
All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
Five cases had single - shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block .
The dose of hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg . Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> of hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
In the other 3 cases , direct <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> was also probable , but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology .
All cases sustained permanent <START:Disease> neurological deficits <END> .
We recommend that hyperbaric <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2 % and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg .
<START:Chemical> Sulpiride <END> - induced <START:Disease> tardive dystonia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sulpiride <END> is a selective D 2 - receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> properties .
Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects , <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> - induced <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> and <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> have been reported occasionally .
We studied a 37 - year - old man who developed persistent segmental <START:Disease> dystonia <END> within 2 months after starting <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> therapy .
We could not find any previous reports of <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> - induced <START:Disease> tardive dystonia <END> .
Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> .
The <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> action of anticancer drugs such as <START:Chemical> nitrogranulogen <END> ( <START:Chemical> NG <END> ) , <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> ( <START:Chemical> MTX <END> ) , <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CY <END> ) administered alone or in combination [ <START:Chemical> MTX <END> + <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> + <START:Chemical> CY <END> ( CMF ) ] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats .
After drug administration , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined , as well as <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance .
Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed .
After <START:Chemical> MTX <END> administration a significant increase ( p = 0 . 0228 ) in the plasma <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration and a significant ( p = 0 . 0001 ) decrease in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance was noted compared to controls .
After the administration of <START:Chemical> NG <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> and <START:Chemical> CY <END> neither a statistically significant increase in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration nor an increase in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics .
Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen , a statistically significant decrease ( p = 0 . 0343 ) in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance was found , but <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls .
<START:Chemical> CY <END> caused <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> in 40 % of rats , but it did not cause this complication when combined with <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> and <START:Chemical> MTX <END> .
Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of <START:Chemical> MTX <END> , <START:Chemical> CY <END> and <START:Chemical> NG <END> , while no such change was observed after <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> and joint administration of <START:Chemical> MTX <END> + <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> + <START:Chemical> CY <END> compared to controls .
Our studies indicate that <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> MTX <END> + <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> + <START:Chemical> CY <END> administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy .
Erythropoietin restores the <START:Disease> anemia <END> - induced reduction in <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> in rat <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of <START:Disease> anemia <END> prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) treatment on the <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in solid experimental <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
<START:Disease> Anemia <END> was induced using a single dose of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> ( 50 mg / kg i . v . ) resulting in a long - lasting reduction ( 30 % ) of the hemoglobin concentration .
In a second group , the development of <START:Disease> anemia <END> was prevented by rHuEPO ( 1000 IU / kg ) administered s . c . three times / week starting 7 days before <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> application .
Four days after <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> treatment , <START:Disease> tumors <END> ( DS - <START:Disease> sarcoma <END> of the rat ) were implanted s . c . onto the hind food dorsum .
Neither <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> nor rHuEPO treatment influenced <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth rate per se .
When <START:Disease> tumors <END> were treated with a single dose of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( 60 mg / kg i . p . ) 5 days after implantation , a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the <START:Disease> tumors <END> was observed .
In the <START:Disease> anemia <END> group , the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days versus 8 . 6 days ) .
In the group where <START:Disease> anemia <END> was prevented by rHuEPO treatment , growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days ) .
These results suggest that chemotherapy - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> reduces <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in <START:Disease> tumors <END> , whereas correction of <START:Disease> anemia <END> by rHuEPO treatment ( epoetin alpha ) increases the sensitivity , probably as a result of an improved <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply to <START:Disease> tumor <END> tissue .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> potentiation of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in mice .
In the present study , effects of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> on <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in mice have been investigated .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> but not <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> induced a dose - dependent <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The response of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> was potentiated by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Intraperitoneal administration of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> , <START:Chemical> mecamylamine <END> , and <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> to mice reduced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by a combination of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Intracerebroventricular injection of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> , and <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> also decreased <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> plus <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Intraperitoneal administration of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> , decreased the effect of a single dose of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
It was concluded that <START:Chemical> morphine <END> <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors , and the potentiation of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> induced by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms .
Production of autochthonous <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> in Lobund - Wistar rats by treatments with <START:Chemical> N - nitroso - N - methylurea <END> and <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> .
More than 50 % of Lobund - Wistar ( L - W ) strain rats developed large , palpable <START:Disease> prostate adenocarcinomas <END> ( <START:Disease> PAs <END> ) following treatments with <START:Chemical> N - nitroso - N - methylurea <END> ( CAS : 684 - 93 - 5 ) and <START:Chemical> testosterone propionate <END> [ ( <START:Chemical> TP <END> ) CAS : 57 - 85 - 2 ] , and most of the <START:Disease> tumor <END> - bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions .
The incubation periods averaged 10 . 6 months .
Within the same timeframe , no L - W rat developed a similar palpable <START:Disease> PA <END> when treated only with <START:Chemical> TP <END> .
In L - W rats , <START:Chemical> TP <END> acted as a <START:Disease> tumor <END> enhancement agent , with primary emphasis on the development of <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> , acting through central alpha - 2 adrenoceptors , prevents opiate - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> in the rat .
The highly - selective alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> ) is capable of inducing <START:Disease> muscle flaccidity <END> and anesthesia in rats and dogs .
Intense generalized <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists .
Although the neurochemistry of opiate - induced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> has yet to be fully elucidated , recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism .
In the present study , the authors determined if treatment with <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> prevents the <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> caused by high - dose <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> anesthesia in the rat .
Animals ( n = 42 ) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens : 1 ) L - MED ( the inactive L - isomer of <START:Chemical> medetomidine <END> ) , 30 micrograms / kg ; 2 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> , 10 micrograms / kg ; 3 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> , 30 micrograms / kg ; 4 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the central - acting alpha - 2 antagonist , <START:Chemical> idazoxan <END> [ 10 mg / kg ] ; 5 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the peripheral - acting alpha - 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> DG - 5128 <END> [ 10 mg / kg ] , or ; 6 ) saline .
Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment .
Each rat was then injected with <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> ( <START:Chemical> ALF <END> , 0 . 5 mg / kg sc ) .
<START:Chemical> ALF <END> injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L - MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> prevented <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> in a dose - dependent fashion .
The small EMG values obtained in the high - dose <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate .
The high - dose <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> animals were flaccid , <START:Disease> akinetic <END> , and lacked a <START:Disease> startle <END> response during the entire experimental period . ( ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION : <START:Disease> Confusion <END> is an adverse drug reaction frequently observed with <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> .
Some case reports are published in the literature but no systematic study from a sample of patients has been published .
We performed this study in order to describe the main characteristics of this adverse drug reaction .
METHODS : Using the French Pharmacovigilance database , we selected the cases of <START:Disease> confusion <END> reported since 1985 with <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> .
RESULTS : 272 cases of <START:Disease> confusion <END> were reported with <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> : 153 women and 119 men .
<START:Disease> Confusion <END> mostly occurred during the two first weeks following <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> exposure ( 39 . 7 % ) .
It was " serious " for almost 2 / 3 of the patients ( 62 . 5 % ) and its outcome favourable in most of the cases ( 82 % ) .
The occurrence of this ADR was more frequent in patients aged between 61 and 80 years .
CONCLUSION : This work shows that <START:Disease> confusion <END> with <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> is a serious , rather frequent but reversible adverse drug reaction .
It occurs especially in older patients and during the first two weeks of treatment .
<START:Chemical> Antithymocyte globulin <END> in the treatment of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> .
A patient who received <START:Chemical> antithymocyte globulin <END> therapy for <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> due to <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> therapy is described .
Bone marrow recovery and peripheral blood recovery were complete 1 month and 3 months , respectively , after treatment , and blood transfusion or other therapies were not necessary in a follow - up period of more than 2 years .
Use of <START:Chemical> antithymocyte globulin <END> may be the optimal treatment of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> .
Effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor ( CEI ) <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> was assessed in Munich - Wistar rats with established <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
Rats were given a single dose of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> and one month later divided into four groups matched for <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> , blood pressure , and plasma albumin concentration .
Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> .
Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days .
These short - term studies showed that <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> reduced arterial blood pressure ( 101 + / - 2 vs . 124 + / - 3 mm Hg , group 2 vs . 1 , P less than 0 . 05 ) and glomerular capillary pressure ( 54 + / - 1 vs . 61 + / - 2 mm Hg , P less than 0 . 05 ) without reducing <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> ( 617 + / - 50 vs . 570 + / - 47 mg / day ) or GFR ( 1 . 03 + / - 0 . 04 vs . 1 . 04 + / - 0 . 11 ml / min ) .
Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> on progression of <START:Disease> renal injury <END> in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
Chronic <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> in group 4 .
Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR ( 0 . 35 + / - 0 . 08 ml / min at 4 months , 0 . 27 + / - 0 . 07 ml / min at 6 months ) .
<START:Chemical> Enalapril <END> treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 ( 0 . 86 + / - 0 . 15 ml / min at 4 months , 0 . 69 + / - 0 . 13 ml / min at 6 months , both P less than 0 . 05 vs . group 3 ) .
Reduction in GFR was associated with the development of <START:Disease> glomerular sclerosis <END> in both treated and untreated rats . ( ABSTRACT

Development of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and / or duration of symptoms .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> LIDs <END> ) present a major problem for the long - term management of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) patients .
Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations , it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of <START:Disease> LIDs <END> .
Using macaque monkeys with different types of <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> , the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression , symptom severity , and response to and duration of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy may be involved in the development of <START:Disease> LIDs <END> .
Monkeys with acute ( short - term ) <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> exposure , rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy developed <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> between 11 and 24 days of daily <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> administration .
In contrast , monkeys with long - term <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> exposure , slow symptom progression and / or long symptom duration prior to initiation of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy were more resistant to developing <START:Disease> LIDs <END> ( e . g . , <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> administration ) .
All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug .
These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop <START:Disease> LIDs <END> in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> LIDs <END> .
<START:Chemical> Etoposide <END> - related <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
The occurrence of a <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> is reported after chemotherapy containing <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , in a man with no risk factors for <START:Disease> coronary heart disease <END> .
Possible causal mechanisms are discussed .
Interactive effects of variations in [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o and [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency .
The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of <START:Chemical> Na <END> and <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o and [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o ) on both , the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> , were studied in the isolated rat atria .
Basal frequency ( BF ) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 + / - 4 beats / min .
in control Krebs - Ringer containing 137 mM <START:Chemical> Na <END> and 1 . 35 mM <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( N ) .
It decreased by 16 + / - 3 % by lowering [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o to 78 mM ( LNa ) , 23 + / - 2 % by lowering simultaneously [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o to 78 mM and [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o to 0 . 675 mM ( LNa + LCa ) and 31 + / - 5 % by lowering [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o to 78 mM plus increasing [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o to 3 . 6 mM ( LNa + HCa ) .
At normal [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o , decrease ( 0 . 675 mM ) or increase ( 3 . 6 mM ) of [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o did not modify BF ; a reduction of ten times ( 0 . 135 mM of normal [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o was effective to reduce BF by 40 + / - 13 % .
All negative chronotropic effects were BF - dependent .
Dose - dependent <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> was potentiated by LNa , LCa , and HCa .
Independent but not additive effects of <START:Chemical> Na <END> and <START:Chemical> Ca <END> are shown by decreases in the values of [ <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> ] o needed to reduce BF by 30 % ( IC 30 ) with the following order of inhibitory potency : LNa > LCa > HCa > N , resulting LNa + HCa similar to LNa .
The [ <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> ] o that arrested atrial beating ( AC ) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa + LCa = LNa + HCa = LCa > HCa = N .
The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [ <START:Chemical> Na <END> ] o than on [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ] o in a range of + / - 50 % of their normal concentration .
Also the enhancement of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa . ( ABSTRACT

<START:Chemical> Dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Angina <END> and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization procedures .
To our knowledge , this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> therapy , although <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
Epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients ; a coronary " steal " phenomenon may be the mechanism of the <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> ischemia <END> observed .
Cause of <START:Disease> death <END> among patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> : a rare mortality due to <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhage <END> .
Causes of <START:Disease> death <END> , with special reference to <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhage <END> , among 240 patients with pathologically verified <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> were investigated using the Annuals of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan from 1981 to 1985 .
The leading causes of <START:Disease> death <END> were <START:Disease> pneumonia <END> and <START:Disease> bronchitis <END> ( 44 . 1 % ) , malignant <START:Disease> neoplasms <END> ( 11 . 6 % ) , <START:Disease> heart diseases <END> ( 4 . 1 % ) , <START:Disease> cerebral infarction <END> ( 3 . 7 % ) and <START:Disease> septicaemia <END> ( 3 . 3 % ) .
<START:Disease> Cerebral haemorrhage <END> was the 11 th most frequent cause of <START:Disease> death <END> , accounting for only 0 . 8 % of <START:Disease> deaths <END> among the patients , whereas it was the 5 th most common cause of <START:Disease> death <END> among the Japanese general population in 1985 .
The low incidence of <START:Disease> cerebral haemorrhage <END> as a cause of <START:Disease> death <END> in patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> may reflect the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and a <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> mechanism due to reduced <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> levels in the <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> brain .
Relative efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> in oncology patients .
We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> netilmicin sulfate <END> or <START:Chemical> tobramycin sulfate <END> in conjunction with <START:Chemical> piperacillin sodium <END> in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe <START:Disease> infections <END> .
The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> ( 17 % vs 11 % ) .
<START:Disease> Ototoxicity <END> occurred in four ( 9 . 5 % ) of 42 <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> and in 12 ( 22 % ) of 54 <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients .
Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms , three of four <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients .
The number of greater than or equal to 15 - dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15 - dB changes ( increases and decreases ) was significantly lower in <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - vs <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115 ) .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> - associated <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> was less severe and more often reversible with <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> than with <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> combined with whole body <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> on <START:Disease> tumor <END> and normal tissues .
Thermal enhancement of <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> - mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue <START:Disease> toxicities <END> by whole body <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> were compared using a F 344 rat model .
Antitumor activity was studied using a <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth delay assay .
Acute normal tissue <START:Disease> toxicities <END> ( i . e . , <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ) and late normal tissue <START:Disease> toxicities <END> ( i . e . , <START:Disease> myocardial and kidney injury <END> ) were evaluated by functional / physiological assays and by morphological techniques .
Whole body <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> ( 120 min at 41 . 5 degrees C ) enhanced both <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> - mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects .
The thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antitumor activity was 1 . 6 .
Thermal enhancement ratios estimated for " acute " hematological changes were 1 . 3 , whereas those estimated for " late " damage ( based on morphological <START:Disease> cardiac and renal lesions <END> ) varied between 2 . 4 and 4 . 3 .
Thus , while whole body <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> enhances <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> - mediated antitumor effect , normal tissue <START:Disease> toxicity <END> is also increased , and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment is eroded .
Noxious chemical stimulation of rat facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow through a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex -- an experimental model for <START:Disease> vascular dysfunctions <END> in <START:Disease> cluster headache <END> .
<START:Disease> Cluster headache <END> is characterized by typical autonomic dysfunctions including facial and <START:Disease> intracranial vascular disturbances <END> .
Both the trigeminal and the cranial parasympathetic systems may be involved in mediating these dysfunctions .
An experimental model was developed in the rat to measure changes in lacrimation and intracranial blood flow following noxious chemical stimulation of facial mucosa .
Blood flow was monitored in arteries of the exposed cranial dura mater and the parietal cortex using laser Doppler flowmetry .
<START:Chemical> Capsaicin <END> ( 0 . 01 - 1 mm ) applied to oral or nasal mucosa induced <START:Disease> increases in dural and cortical blood flow <END> and provoked lacrimation .
These responses were blocked by systemic pre - administration of <START:Chemical> hexamethonium chloride <END> ( 20 mg / kg ) .
The evoked <START:Disease> increases in dural blood flow <END> were also abolished by topical pre - administration of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> ( 1 mm ) and [ Lys 1 , Pro 2 , 5 , Arg 3 , 4 , Tyr 6 ] - VIP ( 0 . 1 mm ) , a vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) antagonist , onto the exposed dura mater .
We conclude that noxious stimulation of facial mucosa increases intracranial blood flow and lacrimation via a trigemino - parasympathetic reflex .
The blood flow responses seem to be mediated by the release of <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> and VIP within the meninges .
Similar mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> cluster headache <END> .
<START:Chemical> Thyroxine <END> abuse : an unusual case of <START:Disease> thyrotoxicosis <END> in pregnancy .
<START:Disease> Eating disorders <END> and the associated behavioural problems and <START:Disease> drug abuse <END> are uncommon in pregnancy .
When they do occur they are often unrecognized because of denial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fetus .
This case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with <START:Disease> eating disorders <END> in pregnancy , including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic abuse .
In particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with <START:Disease> eating disorders <END> and reminds us that when a cause for <START:Disease> thyrotoxicosis <END> remains obscure , <START:Chemical> thyroxine <END> abuse should be considered and explored .
Hepatic reactions associated with <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> in the United Kingdom .
<START:Chemical> Ketoconazole <END> was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1981 .
By November 1984 the Committee on Safety of Medicines had received 82 reports of possible <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> associated with the drug , including five <START:Disease> deaths <END> .
An analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16 , including three <START:Disease> deaths <END> , were probably related to treatment with the drug .
Of the remainder , 48 were possibly related to treatment , five were unlikely to be so , and six were unclassifiable .
The mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 57 . 9 , with <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> being more common in women .
The average duration of treatment before the onset of <START:Disease> jaundice <END> was 61 days .
None of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treatment .
The results of serum liver function tests suggested <START:Disease> hepatocellular injury <END> in 10 ( 63 % ) ; the rest showed a mixed pattern .
In contrast , the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> .
The characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were similar .
Allergic manifestations such as <START:Disease> rash <END> and <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> were rare .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis <END> was usually reversible when treatment was stopped , with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3 . 1 months .
In two of the three <START:Disease> deaths <END> probably associated with <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of <START:Disease> jaundice <END> and other symptoms of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> is advised during long term treatment with <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> to prevent possible serious <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> .
Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> on canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
Using two - stage coronary ligation - , <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - , and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> , antiarrhythmic effects of <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> model was determined .
<START:Chemical> Cibenzoline <END> suppressed all the <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> , and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> induced by 24 - h coronary ligation , 48 - h coronary ligation , <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> , and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> were 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 9 ( by 8 mg / kg i . v . ) , 1 . 6 + / - 0 . 5 ( by 8 mg / kg i . v . ) , 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 ( by 2 mg / kg i . v . ) , and 3 . 5 + / - 1 . 3 ( by 5 mg / kg i . v . ) micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SDM , n = 6 - 7 ) .
The concentration for <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> was significantly higher than those for the other types of <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> .
This pharmacological profile is similar to those of <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> and <START:Chemical> tocainide <END> , and all three drugs have central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant action .
Because <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> had only weak <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> and sinus node <START:Disease> depressive <END> effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> dogs , its clinical usefulness is expected .
Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - induced rat <START:Disease> pituitary tumors <END> may mediate <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - initiated <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis .
<START:Chemical> Estrogens <END> , which have been associated with several types of human and animal <START:Disease> cancers <END> , can induce <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats .
The mechanistic details of <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis induction , during <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> , are still unknown .
To elucidate the role of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> in the regulation of <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats , the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen ( FVIIIRAg ) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor / vascular permeability factor ( VEGF / VPF ) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis .
The expression of VEGF receptor ( VEGFR - 2 / Flk - 1 / KDR ) was also examined by immunohistochemistry .
The results demonstrated that <START:Chemical> 17 beta - estradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure .
The high <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF / VPF protein expression in the <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( OVEX ) rats .
VEGF / VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( UEA 1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non - endothelial cells .
After 15 days of <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> exposure , VEGF / VPF protein expression , in the non - endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels .
The function of non - endothelial - derived VEGF is not clear .
Furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR - 2 ( flk - 1 / KDR ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> exposure .
These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor ( VEGFR - 2 ) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> induced <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis in the rat pituitary .
<START:Chemical> Steroid <END> structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti - <START:Disease> amnesic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> pregnenolone sulphate <END> in the passive avoidance task in rats .
<START:Chemical> Pregnenolone sulphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> ) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies , with particular importance in the ageing process .
The mechanism by which this endogenous <START:Chemical> steroid <END> enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems .
This hypothesis stems from findings that <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> is a potent positive modulator of <START:Chemical> N - methyl - d - aspartate <END> receptors ( NMDARs ) and a negative modulator of <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acid <END> ( A ) receptors ( <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs ) .
Moreover , <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> is able to reverse the <START:Disease> amnesic <END> - like effects of NMDAR and <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) R ligands .
To investigate this hypothesis , the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> , which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and / or <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) R function .
The analogs tested were : <START:Chemical> 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate <END> ( an agent that is inactive at <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , <START:Chemical> epipregnanolone ( [ 3 beta - hydroxy - 5 beta - pregnan - 20 - one ] sulphate <END> , an inhibitor of both <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , and a newly synthesized ( - ) <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> enantiomer ( which is identical to <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> in effects on <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) .
The memory - enhancing effects of <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
Both <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> and its ( - ) enantiomer blocked the effects of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> .
The results show that , unlike <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> , <START:Chemical> 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate <END> and <START:Chemical> epipregnanolone sulphate <END> failed to block the effect of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> , suggesting that altering the modulation of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> .
Moreover , enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ketoconazole <END> induced <START:Disease> torsades de pointes <END> without concomitant use of QT interval - prolonging drug .
<START:Chemical> Ketoconazole <END> is not known to be proarrhythmic without concomitant use of QT interval - prolonging drugs .
We report a woman with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> who developed a markedly <START:Disease> prolonged QT interval <END> and <START:Disease> torsades de pointes <END> ( <START:Disease> TdP <END> ) after taking <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> for treatment of <START:Disease> fungal infection <END> .
Her QT interval returned to normal upon withdrawal of <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> .
Genetic study did not find any mutation in her genes that encode cardiac IKr channel proteins .
We postulate that by virtue of its direct blocking action on IKr , <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> alone may prolong QT interval and induce <START:Disease> TdP <END> .
This calls for attention when <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> is administered to patients with risk factors for acquired <START:Disease> long QT syndrome <END> .
Cardiac transplantation : improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol .
The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients .
In group I , <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17 . 5 mg / kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng / ml .
In group II , <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> , which was used for the first postoperative week .
Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood <START:Chemical> urea nitrogen <END> and serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels .
Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> secondary to long - term therapy with <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> .
Despite this improvement in late renal function , group II still shows a slow rise in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> .
We think that even these lower dosages of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> can cause chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect .
Effects of acute <START:Chemical> steroid <END> administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats .
Occasional case reports have shown that acute <START:Disease> myopathy <END> may occur in patients treated with massive doses of <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
The mechanism of this <START:Disease> myopathy <END> is poorly understood .
Therefore , 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline ( C ) , <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> M <END> ) , or <START:Chemical> triamcinolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> T <END> ) 80 mg / kg / d for 5 d .
Nutritional intake , measured daily in 15 animals , showed a significant <START:Disease> reduction of food intake <END> in the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - treated groups ( - 50 and - 79 % in <START:Chemical> M <END> and <START:Chemical> T <END> , respectively ) .
This was associated with a similar <START:Disease> loss in body weight <END> .
In the 45 remaining animals , diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied .
Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after <START:Chemical> steroid <END> treatment .
Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group ( 653 + / - 174 g / cm ( 2 )) than in the <START:Chemical> M <END> group ( 837 + / - 171 g / cm ( 2 ) ; p < 0 . 05 ) and the <START:Chemical> T <END> group ( 765 + / - 145 g / cm ( 2 ) , NS ) .
Half - relaxation time was prolonged in both <START:Chemical> steroid <END> groups , and time to peak tension was longer with <START:Chemical> M <END> , whereas <START:Disease> tetanic <END> tensions were similar .
<START:Chemical> Steroid <END> treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force - frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
ATPase staining of the diaphragm , scalenus medius , and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber <START:Disease> atrophy <END> in the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa <START:Disease> atrophy <END> with <START:Chemical> T <END> , whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of <START:Disease> necrosis <END> .
Finally , a pair - fed ( PF ) study , performed in 18 rats ( C , <START:Chemical> T <END> , and PF ) , showed that <START:Disease> muscle atrophy <END> was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in <START:Chemical> T <END> - treated animals .
We conclude that ( 1 ) short - term treatment with massive doses of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting ; ( 2 ) both types of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> induced predominantly type IIb <START:Disease> atrophy <END> , resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties ; ( 3 ) neither <START:Chemical> steroid <END> caused muscle <START:Disease> necrosis <END> ; ( 4 ) type IIb <START:Disease> atrophy <END> was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone .
Attentional modulation of perceived <START:Disease> pain <END> intensity in <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced secondary <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
Perceived <START:Disease> pain <END> intensity is modulated by attention .
However , it is not known that how <START:Disease> pain <END> intensity ratings are affected by attention in <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced secondary <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
Here we show that perceived <START:Disease> pain <END> intensity in secondary <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> is decreased when attention is distracted away from the painful pinprick stimulus with a visual task .
Furthermore , it was found that the magnitude of attentional modulation in secondary <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> is very similar to that of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - untreated , control condition .
Our findings , showing no interaction between <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> treatment and attentional modulation suggest that <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced secondary <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> and attention might affect mechanical <START:Disease> pain <END> through independent mechanisms .
Antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> .
The antinociceptive effect of <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - tropyl 2 - ( p - bromophenyl ) propionate <END> [ ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> ] ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 s . c . ; 30 - 60 mg kg - 1 p . o . ; 10 - 30 mg kg - 1 i . v . ; 10 - 30 micrograms / mouse i . c . v . ) was examined in mice , rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot - plate , abdominal - constriction , tail - flick and paw - pressure tests .
( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished .
The antinociception produced by ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , the M 1 - selective antagonists <START:Chemical> pirenzepine <END> and <START:Chemical> dicyclomine <END> and the <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> depletor <START:Chemical> hemicholinium - 3 <END> , but not by the opioid antagonist <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> , the <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acidB <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> 3 - aminopropyl - diethoxy - methyl - phosphinic acid <END> , the H 3 agonist <START:Chemical> R - ( alpha ) - methylhistamine <END> , the D 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> quinpirole <END> , the <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamine 4 <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> 2 - methoxy - 4 - amino - 5 - chlorobenzoic acid 2 - ( diethylamino ) ethyl ester <END> hydrochloride , the <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamin 1 A <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> 1 - ( 2 - methoxyphenyl ) - 4 - [ 4 - ( 2 - phthalimido ) butyl ] piperazine <END> hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
Based on these data , it can be postulated that ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission .
( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> ( 10 - 40 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) was able to prevent <START:Disease> amnesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> dicyclomine <END> ( 2 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) in the mouse passive - avoidance test .
Affinity profiles of ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> for muscarinic receptor subtypes , determined by functional studies ( rabbit vas deferens for M 1 , guinea pig atrium for M 2 , guinea pig ileum for M 3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M 4 ) , have shown an M 4 / M 1 selectivity ratio of 10 . 2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti - <START:Disease> amnesic <END> effect induced by ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> through an increase in <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> extracellular levels .
In the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range , ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> PG - 9 <END> did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota - rod test and Animex apparatus .
<START:Chemical> Suxamethonium <END> infusion rate and observed <START:Disease> fasciculations <END> .
A dose - response study .
<START:Chemical> Suxamethonium chloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> Sch <END> ) was administered i . v . to 36 adult males at six rates : 0 . 25 mg s - 1 to 20 mg s - 1 .
The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to <START:Disease> tetanic <END> stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when <START:Chemical> Sch <END> 120 mg was exceeded .
Six additional patients received a 30 - mg i . v . bolus dose .
<START:Disease> Fasciculations <END> in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total <START:Disease> fasciculation <END> score .
The times to first <START:Disease> fasciculation <END> , <START:Disease> twitch <END> suppression and <START:Disease> tetanus <END> suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates .
<START:Disease> Fasciculations <END> in the six areas and the total <START:Disease> fasciculation <END> score were related directly to the rate of infusion .
Total <START:Disease> fasciculation <END> scores in the 30 - mg bolus group and the 5 - mg s - 1 and 20 - mg s - 1 infusion groups were not significantly different .
Evaluation of adverse reactions of <START:Chemical> aponidine hydrochloride <END> ophthalmic solution .
We prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of <START:Chemical> apraclonidine <END> in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1 % <START:Chemical> apraclonidine <END> in their right eyes .
Examinations , including blood pressure , pulse rate , conjunctiva and cornea , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , pupil diameter , basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of both upper and lower eyelids , were performed prior to entry and at 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 hours after instillation .
The <START:Disease> ocular hypotensive <END> effects were statistically significant for <START:Chemical> apraclonidine <END> - treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1 % <START:Chemical> apraclonidine <END> .
<START:Disease> Decreases in systolic blood pressure <END> were statistically , but not clinically , significant .
No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted .
<START:Disease> Conjunctival blanching <END> and <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> were commonly found .
Upper lid retraction was frequently noted .
While the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance , one subject suffered from mechanical <START:Disease> entropion <END> and marked <START:Disease> corneal abrasion <END> 3 hours after instillation of the medication .
This may well be a particularly notable finding in Asian people .
Epithelial <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel ( ENaC ) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
In experimental <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> , urinary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease .
The molecular mechanism ( s ) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated .
The rate - limiting constituent of collecting duct <START:Chemical> sodium <END> transport is the epithelial <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel ( ENaC ) .
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
The time courses of urinary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion , plasma <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> concentration and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> were studied in male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either <START:Chemical> PAN <END> or vehicle .
The relative amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real - time quantitative TaqMan PCR , and the amounts of proteins by Western blot .
The kinetics of urinary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion and the appearance of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> were comparable with those reported previously .
<START:Chemical> Sodium <END> retention occurred on days 2 , 3 and 6 after <START:Chemical> PAN <END> injection .
A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention on days 2 and 3 .
Conversely , down - regulation of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> concentrations , and was followed by a return of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion to control values .
The amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during <START:Chemical> PAN <END> - induced <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention .
In conclusion , ENaC mRNA expression , especially alphaENaC , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of <START:Chemical> PAN <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> in rats , but appears to escape from the regulation by <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> after day 3 .
Possible <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> - associated <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of persistent <START:Disease> hiccups <END> associated by <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> therapy .
CASE SUMMARY : A 76 - year - old man presented with persistent <START:Disease> hiccups <END> after beginning <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> for the treatment of <START:Disease> pharyngitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Hiccups <END> were persistent and exhausting .
Discontinuation of <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> and therapy with <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> finally resolved <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
No organic cause of <START:Disease> hiccups <END> was identified despite extensive investigation .
DISCUSSION : Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
Corticosteroids ( <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> and <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ) , <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> ( <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> ) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
Few cases of drug - induced <START:Disease> hiccups <END> have been reported related to <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antimicrobials .
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points ) , mostly because of the close temporal sequence , previous reports on this reaction with other <START:Chemical> macrolides <END> and the absence of any alternative explanation for <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> could be the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> hiccups <END> in our patient .
CONCLUSIONS : Diagnosis of drug - induced <START:Disease> hiccups <END> is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination .
However , <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with <START:Disease> hiccups <END> and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect .
Clinically significant <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> following the administration of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> to renal transplant recipients .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) - based regimens .
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> linked with the use of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> .
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> use .
In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> therapy and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> implicated <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> as the most likely etiology of the <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
METHODS : We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen .
In these patients , the magnitude of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> ratios , an estimate of grams of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> / day .
Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> use .
RESULTS : Twenty - eight patients ( 24 % ) developed increased <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> from baseline during their post - transplantation course .
In 21 patients an alternative cause of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive .
In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> and the development of <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> - range <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> correlated most strongly with <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables .
In most patients , discontinuation of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> resulted in a decrease , but not resolution , of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> induces or aggravates pre - existing <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> may improve , but does not resolve , when <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> is withdrawn .
Effect of <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> on renal function in liver transplant recipients receiving <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> .
The effect of <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> on renal function in liver transplant recipients who were receiving <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> was evaluated between January 1992 and January 1996 .
Two groups of patients receiving <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> were compared over a period of 1 year , one group comprising <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> patients who were receiving <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> , and the other comprising nonhypertensive patients not receiving <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> .
The time from transplant to baseline was similar in all patients .
<START:Chemical> Nifedipine <END> significantly improved kidney function as indicated by a significant lowering of serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels at 6 and 12 months .
The observed positive impact of <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> on reducing the <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> in liver transplant recipients should be an important factor in selecting an agent to treat <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in this population .
Neural correlates of <START:Chemical> S - ketamine <END> induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> during overt continuous verbal fluency .
The glutamatergic <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
Administered to healthy volunteers , a subanesthetic dose of the non - competitive <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
In patients with <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> , <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> exacerbates the core symptoms of illness , supporting the hypothesis of a <START:Disease> glutamatergic dysfunction <END> .
In a counterbalanced , placebo - controlled , double - blind study design , healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic <START:Chemical> S - ketamine <END> infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected .
During the scanning period , subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks ( phonological , lexical and semantic ) .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> - induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> elicited <START:Disease> psychosis <END> like psychopathology .
Post - hoc t - tests revealed significant differences between placebo and <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency , while the phonological domain remained unaffected .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency , but not for semantic verbal fluency .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> , particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions .
Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Fluoxetine <END> - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> : clinical and theoretical implications .
Five patients receiving <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> for the treatment of <START:Disease> obsessive compulsive disorder <END> or <START:Disease> major depression <END> developed <START:Disease> akathisia <END> .
The typical <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> - induced symptoms of restlessness , constant pacing , purposeless movements of the feet and legs , and marked <START:Disease> anxiety <END> were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> .
Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> in the past reported that the symptoms of <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> were identical , although somewhat milder .
<START:Disease> Akathisia <END> appeared to be a common side effect of <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> and generally responded well to treatment with the beta - adrenergic antagonist <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , dose reduction , or both .
The authors suggest that <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> and tricyclic <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> - induced " jitteriness " may be identical .
Iatrogenically induced intractable <START:Disease> atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia <END> after <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> and catheter ablation in a patient with <START:Disease> Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy <END> .
In a patient with <START:Disease> WPW syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , intractable <START:Disease> atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia <END> ( <START:Disease> AVRT <END> ) was iatrogenically induced .
QRS without preexcitation , caused by junctional escape beats after <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> or unidirectional antegrade block of accessory pathway after catheter ablation , established frequent <START:Disease> AVRT <END> attack .
<START:Chemical> Sodium bicarbonate <END> alleviates <START:Disease> penile pain <END> induced by intracavernous injections for <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> .
In an attempt to determine whether <START:Disease> penile pain <END> associated with intracorporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication , we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of <START:Disease> penile pain <END> following intracorporeal injections with or without the addition of <START:Chemical> sodium bicarbonate <END> to the intracorporeal medications .
A total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with <START:Disease> impotence <END> received 0 . 2 ml . of a combination of 3 drugs : 6 mg . <START:Chemical> papaverine <END> , 100 micrograms .
<START:Chemical> phentolamine <END> and 10 micrograms .
<START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 1 <END> with ( pH 7 . 05 ) or without ( pH 4 . 17 ) the addition of <START:Chemical> sodium bicarbonate <END> ( 0 . 03 mEq . ) .
Of the 19 patients without <START:Chemical> sodium bicarbonate <END> added to the medication 11 ( 58 % ) complained of <START:Disease> penile pain <END> due to the medication , while only 1 of the 19 men ( 5 % ) who received <START:Chemical> sodium bicarbonate <END> complained of <START:Disease> penile pain <END> .
From these data we conclude that the <START:Disease> penile pain <END> following intracorporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication , which can be overcome by elevating the pH to a neutral level .
Time trends in <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - associated <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
The annual incidence of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - related <START:Disease> bleeding <END> at Brigham and Women ' s Hospital increased from 0 . 97 / 1 , 000 patient admissions in the first time period ( January 1995 to October 1998 ) to 1 . 19 / 1 , 000 patient admissions in the second time period ( November 1998 to August 2002 ) of this study .
The proportion of patients with major and <START:Disease> intracranial bleeding <END> increased from 20 . 2 % and 1 . 9 % , respectively , in the first time period , to 33 . 3 % and 7 . 8 % , respectively , in the second .
Intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> by 15 - minute infusion versus 2 - minute bolus does not affect the incidence of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> : a prospective , randomized , controlled trial .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : We sought to compare the rate of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> after administration of intravenous <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> as a 2 - minute bolus or 15 - minute infusion .
METHODS : We conducted a prospective , randomized , double - blind study in the emergency department of a central - city teaching hospital .
Patients aged 18 years or older treated with <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> for <START:Disease> headache <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , or <START:Disease> vomiting <END> were eligible for inclusion .
Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> administered intravenously by means of 2 - minute push ( bolus group ) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15 - minute period ( infusion group ) .
The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing <START:Disease> akathisia <END> within 60 minutes of administration .
Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or <START:Disease> agitation <END> or a change of 2 or more in the patient - reported <START:Disease> akathisia <END> rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator - observed <START:Disease> akathisia <END> rating scale .
The intensity of <START:Disease> headache <END> and <START:Disease> nausea <END> was measured with a 100 - mm visual analog scale .
RESULTS : One hundred patients were enrolled .
One study participant was excluded after protocol violation .
Seventy - three percent ( 73 / 99 ) of the study participants were treated for <START:Disease> headache <END> and 70 % ( 70 / 99 ) for <START:Disease> nausea <END> .
In the bolus group , 26 . 0 % ( 13 / 50 ) had <START:Disease> akathisia <END> compared with 32 . 7 % ( 16 / 49 ) in the infusion group ( Delta = - 6 . 7 % ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] - 24 . 6 % to 11 . 2 % ) .
The difference between the bolus and infusion groups in the percentage of participants who saw a 50 % reduction in their <START:Disease> headache <END> intensity within 30 minutes was 11 . 8 % ( 95 % CI - 9 . 6 % to 33 . 3 % ) .
The difference in the percentage of patients with a 50 % reduction in their <START:Disease> nausea <END> was 12 . 6 % ( 95 % CI - 4 . 6 % to 29 . 8 % ) .
CONCLUSION : A 50 % reduction in the incidence of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> when <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> was administered by means of 15 - minute intravenous infusion versus a 2 - minute intravenous push was not detected .
The efficacy of <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> headache <END> and <START:Disease> nausea <END> likewise did not appear to be affected by the rate of administration , although no formal statistical comparisons were made .
<START:Chemical> Valsartan <END> , a new <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> antagonist for the treatment of essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> : a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> antagonist , <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> , with a reference therapy , <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> .
METHODS : One hundred sixty - eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate <START:Disease> hypertension <END> were randomly allocated in double - blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> or 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> for 12 weeks .
After 8 weeks of therapy , in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled , 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> was added to the initial therapy .
Patients were assessed at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks .
Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates .
RESULTS : Both <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> and <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
Similar decreases were observed in both groups , with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed .
For the primary variable the difference was 0 . 5 mm Hg in favor of <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> ( p = 0 . 68 ; 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 7 to 1 . 7 ) .
Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66 . 7 % for <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> and 60 . 2 % for <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ( p = 0 . 39 ) .
Both treatments were well tolerated .
The incidence of drug - related dependent <START:Disease> edema <END> was somewhat higher in the <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> group , particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day ( 2 . 4 % for 80 mg <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> ; 3 . 6 % for 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ; 0 % for <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> plus 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ; 14 . 3 % for 10 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The data show that <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> is at least as effective as <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> in the treatment of mild to moderate <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
The results also show <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class , <START:Chemical> dihydropyridine <END> <START:Chemical> calcium <END> antagonists .
<START:Chemical> Ceftriaxone <END> - associated <START:Disease> biliary pseudolithiasis <END> in paediatric surgical patients .
It is well known that <START:Chemical> ceftriaxone <END> leads to <START:Disease> pseudolithiasis <END> in some patients .
Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing <START:Disease> gallbladder dysfunction <END> , such as fasting , may have a role for the development of <START:Disease> pseudolithiasis <END> .
In this study , we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of <START:Disease> pseudolithiasis <END> in paediatric surgical patients receiving <START:Chemical> ceftriaxone <END> treatment , who often had to fast in the post - operative period .
Fifty children who were given <START:Chemical> ceftriaxone <END> were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms .
Of those , 13 ( 26 % ) developed biliary pathology .
Comparison of the patients with or without <START:Disease> pseudolithiasis <END> revealed no significant difference with respect to age , sex , duration of the treatment and starvation variables .
After cessation of the treatment , <START:Disease> pseudolithiasis <END> resolved spontaneously within a short period .
The incidence of <START:Disease> pseudolithiasis <END> is not affected by fasting .
Continuous subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> to prevent <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> is a major potential <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> that can be prevented by administering <START:Chemical> mesna <END> along with the cytotoxic agent .
<START:Chemical> Mesna <END> is generally administered by the intravenous route , although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased .
The continuous subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access .
In addition , subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary <START:Chemical> mesna <END> concentrations , such as in a patient taking oral <START:Chemical> mesna <END> who experiences severe <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> emesis <END> and is unable to absorb the drug .
Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous <START:Chemical> mesna <END> administration suggests it is a safe , practical , and economic method of drug delivery that permits <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting .
<START:Chemical> 5 flourouracil <END> - induced <START:Disease> apical ballooning syndrome <END> : a case report .
The <START:Disease> apical ballooning syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> ABS <END> ) is a recently described stress - mediated <START:Disease> acute cardiac syndrome <END> characterized by transient wall - motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with <START:Disease> hyperkinesis <END> of the basal left ventricular ( LV ) segments without obstructive <START:Disease> epicardial coronary disease <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxicity <END> is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents .
However , there are no reports of <START:Disease> ABS <END> secondary to chemotherapeutic agents .
We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic <START:Disease> cancer <END> .
A 79 - year - old woman presented with typical <START:Disease> ischemic <END> <START:Disease> chest pain <END> , elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST - segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram .
She underwent recent chemotherapy with <START:Chemical> fluorouracil <END> for metastatic <START:Disease> colorectal cancer <END> .
Echocardiography revealed a wall - motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared <START:Disease> akinetic <END> .
Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions .
The patient was stabilized with medical therapy .
Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic .
Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical <START:Disease> akinesis <END> .
Pathogenetic mechanisms of <START:Disease> cardiac complications <END> in <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients undergoing chemotherapy include <START:Disease> coronary vasospasm <END> , endothelial damage and consequent <START:Disease> thrombus <END> formation .
In our patient , both supraphysiologic levels of plasma <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> and stress related neuropeptides caused by <START:Disease> cancer <END> diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of <START:Disease> ABS <END> .
Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT ) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during <START:Chemical> sodium nitroprusside <END> infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent .
Before <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> infusion , 5 cm <START:Chemical> H 2 O <END> CPAP significantly , P less than . 05 , decreased arterial blood pressure , but did not significantly alter heart rate , cardiac output , systemic vascular resistance , or QS / QT .
Ten cm <START:Chemical> H 2 O <END> CPAP before <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> infusion produced a further <START:Disease> decrease in arterial blood pressure <END> and significantly increased heart rate and <START:Disease> decreased cardiac output <END> and QS / QT .
<START:Chemical> Nitroprusside <END> caused significant <START:Disease> decreases in arterial blood pressure <END> and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate , but did not change cardiac output or QS / QT .
Five cm <START:Chemical> H 2 O <END> CPAP during <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> did not further alter any of the above - mentioned variables .
However , 10 cm <START:Chemical> H 2 O <END> CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure , cardiac output , and QS / QT .
These data indicate that <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40 - 50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS / QT .
During <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics , but high levels of CPAP ( 10 cm <START:Chemical> H 2 O <END> ) , while decreasing QS / QT , produce marked <START:Disease> decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output <END> .
The effects of the adjunctive <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> on male <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> induced by a <START:Chemical> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <END> : a double - blind placebo - controlled and randomized study .
OBJECTIVE : To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> sustained - release ( SR ) on male <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> ( <START:Disease> SD <END> ) induced by a <START:Chemical> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor <END> ( <START:Chemical> SSRI <END> ) , as <START:Disease> SD <END> is a common side - effect of <START:Chemical> SSRIs <END> and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of <START:Chemical> SSRI <END> .
The men were randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> SR ( 150 mg twice daily , 117 ) or placebo ( twice daily , 117 ) for 12 weeks .
Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression - Sexual Function ( CGI - SF ; the primary outcome measure ) , the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF ) , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX ) , and <START:Disease> Erectile Dysfunction <END> Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction ( EDITS ) ( secondary outcome measures ) .
Participants were followed biweekly during study period .
RESULTS : After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean ( sd ) scores for CGI - SF were significantly lower , i . e . better , in patients on <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> SR , at 2 . 4 ( 1 . 2 ) , than in the placebo group , at 3 . 9 ( 1 . 1 ) ( P = 0 . 01 ) .
Men who received <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> had a significant increase in the total IIEF score ( 54 . 4 % vs 1 . 2 % ; P = 0 . 003 ) , and in the five different domains of the IIEF .
Total ASEX scores were significantly lower , i . e . better , among men who received <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> than placebo , at 15 . 5 ( 4 . 3 ) vs 21 . 5 ( 4 . 7 ) ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
The EDITS scores were 67 . 4 ( 10 . 2 ) for the <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and 36 . 3 ( 11 . 7 ) for the placebo group ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
The ASEX score and CGI - SF score were correlated ( P = 0 . 003 ) .
In linear regression analyses the CGI - SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of <START:Disease> SD <END> , type of <START:Chemical> SSRI <END> used and age .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Bupropion <END> is an effective treatment for male <START:Disease> SD <END> induced by <START:Chemical> SSRIs <END> .
These results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> .
Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> in the rat .
Whereas <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> is a well - known side effect that is associated with high - dose <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> anesthesia , a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism ( s ) .
We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon , using male Sprague - Dawley rats anesthetized with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
Under proper control of respiration , body temperature and end - tidal <START:Chemical> CO 2 <END> , intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> ( 50 or 100 micrograms / kg ) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles .
Such an induced <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha - adrenoceptor blocker , <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> .
Microinjection of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> ( 2 . 5 micrograms / 50 nl ) directly into this pontine nucleus , on the other hand , elicited discernible electromyographic excitation .
It is speculated that the induction of <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> by <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons .
<START:Chemical> Isoproterenol <END> induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts : correlation with <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> .
The mechanism of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> is unknown , but a mismatch of <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply vs . demand following coronary <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> myocardial hyperactivity <END> is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed .
Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> .
Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC ) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins , this study tests the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins .
We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> subcutaneous administration .
Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix .
The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin .
Subsequently , after lysis of myofilaments , gamma - sarcoglycan , beta - dystroglycan , beta 1 - integrin , and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown , as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process .
In conclusion , administration of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin , the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte .
These changes , related to <START:Disease> ischaemic injury <END> , explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> .
<START:Disease> Ventricular fibrillation <END> from <START:Chemical> diatrizoate <END> with and without chelating agents .
The <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> Renografin 76 % <END> was compared with that of <START:Chemical> Hypaque 76 % <END> by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dogs .
<START:Chemical> Renografin <END> contains the chelating agents <START:Chemical> sodium citrate <END> and <START:Chemical> disodium edetate <END> , while <START:Chemical> Hypaque <END> contains <START:Chemical> calcium disodium edetate <END> and no <START:Chemical> sodium citrate <END> .
<START:Disease> Ventricular fibrillation <END> occurred significantly more often with <START:Chemical> Renografin <END> , suggesting that chelating agents contribute to <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in coronary angiography .
Comparison of the subjective effects and plasma concentrations following oral and i . m . administration of <START:Chemical> flunitrazepam <END> in volunteers .
<START:Chemical> Flunitrazepam <END> 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 or 2 . 0 mg was given by the oral or i . m . routes to groups of volunteers and its effects compared .
Plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas - liquid chromatography , in a smaller number of the subjects .
The most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose , 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aroused .
The effects of i . m . administration were apparent earlier and sometimes lasted longer than those following oral administration .
<START:Disease> Dizziness <END> was less marked than sedation , but increased with the dose .
There was <START:Disease> pain <END> on i . m . injection of <START:Chemical> flunitrazepam <END> significantly more often than with isotonic saline .
Plasma concentrations varied with dose and route and corresponded qualitatively with the subjective effects .
The drug was still present in measurable quantities after 24 h even with the smallest dose .
<START:Disease> Thrombotic microangiopathy <END> and <START:Disease> renal failure <END> associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy .
Five patients with <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> developed <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> ( characterized by <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> , <START:Disease> microangiopathic hemolytic anemia <END> , and usually <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ) after treatment with <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , <START:Chemical> bleomycin <END> , and a <START:Chemical> vinca alkaloid <END> .
One patient had <START:Disease> thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura <END> , three the <START:Disease> hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> , and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders .
Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of <START:Disease> intravascular coagulation <END> , primarily affecting the small arteries , arterioles , and glomeruli .
Because each patient was <START:Disease> tumor <END> - free or had only a small <START:Disease> tumor <END> at the onset of this syndrome , the <START:Disease> thrombotic microangiopathy <END> may have been induced by chemotherapy .
Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined , because <START:Disease> renal failure <END> may be ascribed to <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and the <START:Disease> anemia <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> to drug - induced <START:Disease> bone marrow suppression <END> .
Immunohistochemical studies with antibodies to neurofilament proteins on <START:Disease> axonal damage <END> in experimental focal lesions in rat .
Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament ( NF ) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class , NF - M and NF - H , was used to study <START:Disease> axonal injury <END> in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats .
Focal <START:Disease> injury in the cortex <END> was produced by infusion of <START:Chemical> lactate <END> at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion .
<START:Disease> Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata <END> were evoked by prolonged <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> .
Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions .
Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state .
These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for <START:Disease> axonal damage <END> in various experimental <START:Disease> traumatic <END> or ischemic lesions .
Lone <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> associated with <START:Chemical> creatine <END> monohydrate supplementation .
<START:Disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> in young patients without structural <START:Disease> heart disease <END> is rare .
Therefore , when the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> is present in this population , reversible causes must be identified and resolved .
<START:Disease> Thyroid disorders <END> , illicit drug or stimulant use , and <START:Disease> acute alcohol intoxication <END> are among these causes .
We report the case of a 30 - year - old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> with rapid ventricular response .
His medical history was unremarkable , except for minor <START:Disease> fractures <END> of the fingers and foot .
Thyroid - stimulating hormone , <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> , and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels were within normal limits , urine drug screen was negative , and <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> use was denied .
However , when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements , the use of <START:Chemical> creatine <END> monohydrate was revealed .
The patient was admitted to the hospital , anticoagulated with unfractionated <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , and given intravenous <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> for rate control and intravenous <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> for rate and rhythm control .
When discharged less than 24 hours later , he was receiving <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> , with follow - up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion .
Exogenous <START:Chemical> creatine <END> is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance .
Vegetarians may also take <START:Chemical> creatine <END> to replace what they are not consuming from meat , fish , and other animal products .
Previous anecdotal reports have linked <START:Chemical> creatine <END> to the development of <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> .
Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements .
In addition , it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature .
<START:Chemical> Tiapride <END> in <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> involuntary movements <END> .
<START:Chemical> Tiapride <END> , a substituted <START:Chemical> benzamide <END> derivative closely related to <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> , reduced <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced peak dose <START:Disease> involuntary movements <END> in 16 patients with <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
However , an unacceptable increase in disability from <START:Disease> Parkinsonism <END> with aggravation of end - of - dose <START:Disease> akinesia <END> led to its cessation in 14 patients .
<START:Chemical> Tiapride <END> had no effect on <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced early morning of " off - period " segmental <START:Disease> dystonia <END> .
These results fail to support the notion that <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors .
Comparison of developmental toxicology of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> ) in rats using selected dosing paradigms .
BACKGROUND : Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) suggests that a low incidence of <START:Disease> developmental anomalies <END> occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis .
<START:Chemical> Aspirin <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> [ <START:Chemical> ASA <END> ] ) , an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor , induces <START:Disease> developmental anomalies <END> when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD ) 9 , 10 , or 11 ( Kimmel CA , Wilson JG , Schumacher HJ .
Teratology 4 : 15 - 24 , 1971 ) .
There are no published <START:Chemical> ASA <END> studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17 .
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) and Wistar strains when <START:Chemical> ASA <END> is administered on GD 9 , 10 , or 11 ; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats ; and to test the hypothesis that maternal <START:Disease> gastrointestinal toxicity <END> confounds the detection of low incidence <START:Disease> malformations <END> with <START:Chemical> ASA <END> when a multiple dosing paradigm is used .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> ASA <END> was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0 , 250 , 500 , or 625 mg / kg ) , 10 ( 0 , 500 , 625 , or 750 mg / kg ) , or 11 ( 0 , 500 , 750 , or 1000 mg / kg ) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0 , 50 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg a day ) in the multiple dose study to SD rats .
Animals were killed on GD 21 , and fetuses were examined viscerally .
RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce <START:Disease> ventricular septal defects <END> ( <START:Disease> VSDs <END> ) and <START:Disease> midline defects <END> ( <START:Disease> MDs <END> ) in rats and <START:Disease> diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( <START:Disease> DH <END> ) , <START:Disease> MDs <END> , and <START:Disease> VSDs <END> in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these <START:Disease> malformations <END> , even though <START:Chemical> ASA <END> induces several other low - incidence <START:Disease> malformations <END> .
In single dose studies , <START:Disease> DH <END> , <START:Disease> MD <END> , and <START:Disease> VSD <END> were induced on GDs 9 and 10 .
<START:Disease> VSD <END> also was noted following treatment on GD 11 .
In contrast , <START:Disease> DH <END> and <START:Disease> MD <END> were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and <START:Disease> VSD <END> was noted across all dose groups .
CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major <START:Disease> developmental anomalies <END> between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of <START:Disease> VSD <END> in the SD rats and <START:Disease> hydrocephalus <END> in the Wistar rats .
Variations and <START:Disease> malformations <END> were similar when <START:Chemical> ASA <END> was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) .
It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , <START:Disease> malformations <END> that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with <START:Chemical> ASA <END> given at multiple doses .
<START:Chemical> Suxamethonium <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> and <START:Disease> death <END> following 5 days of immobilization .
The present report describes a case of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> and subsequent <START:Disease> death <END> as a result of <START:Disease> hyperkalaemia <END> following the use of <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> in a 23 - year - old Malawian woman .
Five days after the onset of the symptoms of <START:Disease> meningitis <END> , the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intubation .
Forty seconds after injection of <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> , <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> occurred .
Attempts to resuscitate the patient were not successful .
The serum level of <START:Chemical> potassium <END> was observed to be 8 . 4 mequiv L - 1 .
Apart from the reduction in the patient ' s level of consciousness , there were no signs of motor neurone damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for <START:Disease> hyperkalaemia <END> following the administration of <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> .
It is postulated that her <START:Disease> death <END> was caused by <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> to <START:Chemical> suxamethonium <END> , associated with her 5 - day immobilization .
Effects of long - term pretreatment with <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> on <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> in conscious rats .
It has been shown that <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5 - day <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .
This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> could abolish <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> in conscious rats .
<START:Chemical> Isoproterenol <END> pretreatment for 15 days caused <START:Disease> cardiac hypertrophy <END> without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate .
In control rats , intravenous <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Bromocriptine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> was unaffected by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> pretreatment , while <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> was reversed to significant <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , an effect that was partly reduced by i . v . <START:Chemical> domperidone <END> ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> pretreatment .
In isolated perfused heart preparations from <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - pretreated rats , the <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline - pretreated rats ( the EC 50 of the <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold ) .
These results show that 15 - day <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> pretreatment not only abolished but reversed <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> to <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .
They suggest that , in normal conscious rats , the central <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> of <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> appears to predominate and to mask the <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> of this agonist at peripheral <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 receptors .
High dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .
OBJECTIVE : This large - scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> .
AIM : To determine the hemodynamic responses , efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies .
Over time , an effective protocol utilizing high dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> as the sole sedative agent has evolved .
METHODS / MATERIALS : As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process , data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed .
Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007 .
RESULTS : Since 2005 , the 10 - min loading dose of our <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg . kg ( - 1 ) , and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1 . 5 to 2 microg . kg ( - 1 ) . h ( - 1 ) .
The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation ( able to complete the imaging study ) when using <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> alone from 91 . 8 % to 97 . 6 % ( P = 0 . 009 ) , reducing the requirement for adjuvant <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> in the event of sedation failure with <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
Although <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> sedation was associated with a 16 % incidence of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20 % of age - adjusted normal range and <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> saturations were 95 % or higher .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies .
While use of high dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established ' awake ' norms , this deviation is generally within 20 % of norms , and is not associated with adverse sequelae .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .
Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of <START:Chemical> difluoromethylornithine <END> and <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> for prevention of sporadic <START:Disease> colorectal adenomas <END> .
A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of <START:Disease> adenomatous polyps <END> after treatment for 36 months with <START:Chemical> difluoromethylornithine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> ) plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> or matched placebos .
Temporary <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> is a known <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of treatment with <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> , thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms .
The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within - subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies .
Based on 290 subjects , there was an average difference of 0 . 50 dB between subjects treated with <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> compared with those treated with placebo ( 95 % confidence interval , - 0 . 64 to 1 . 63 dB ; P = 0 . 39 ) , adjusted for baseline values , age , and frequencies .
In the normal speech range of 500 to 3 , 000 Hz , an estimated difference of 0 . 99 dB ( - 0 . 17 to 2 . 14 dB ; P = 0 . 09 ) was detected .
Dose intensity did not add information to models .
There were 14 of 151 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> group and 4 of 139 ( 2 . 9 % ) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested ( P = 0 . 02 ) .
Follow - up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1 . 08 dB ( - 0 . 81 to 2 . 96 dB ; P = 0 . 26 ) between treatment arms .
There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> group who experienced clinically significant <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> compared with the placebo group .
The estimated attributable risk of <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> from exposure to the drug is 8 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 0 % to 18 . 8 % ; P = 0 . 12 ) .
There is a < 2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> compared with those treated with placebo .
Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> associated <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> ?
BACKGROUND / AIMS : Recently <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as <START:Chemical> sunitinib <END> and <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> have been found to cause acute <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> .
We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against <START:Disease> anemia <END> .
METHODS : Fourteen patients <START:Disease> chronically infected with hepatitis C virus <END> were treated by <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha 2 a <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
Serum hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin - 2 were investigated before and after therapy .
RESULTS : We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period .
Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment .
In contrast with the literature , serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> therapy .
We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin .
CONCLUSION : This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> in patients with <START:Disease> hepatitis C <END> and we could not find any relation .
Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> therapy .
Hepatic <START:Disease> adenomas <END> and <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> of the liver in young women on <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> : case reports .
Two cases of hepatic <START:Disease> adenoma <END> and one of <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> presumably associated with the use of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> , are reported .
Special reference is made to their clinical presentation , which may be totally asymptomatic .
Liver - function tests are of little diagnostic value , but valuable information may be obtained from both liver scanning and hepatic angiography .
Histologic differences and clinical similarities between hepatic <START:Disease> adenoma <END> and <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> of the liver are discussed .
<START:Chemical> Serotonin <END> 6 receptor gene is associated with <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> in a Japanese population .
BACKGROUND : Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for <START:Disease> psychotic disorders <END> such as <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
The <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 6 ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics , such as <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> and <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> , and <START:Chemical> d - amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> in rats is corrected with the use of a selective <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 receptor antagonist .
In addition , the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by <START:Chemical> d - amphetamine <END> or <START:Chemical> phencyclidine <END> was restored by <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats .
These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> , and the above evidence suggests that altered <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> psychotic disorders <END> .
The symptoms of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> are similar to those of <START:Disease> paranoid type schizophrenia <END> .
Therefore , we conducted an analysis of the association of the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 gene ( HTR 6 ) with <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> .
METHOD : Using five tagging SNPs ( rs 6693503 , rs 1805054 , rs 4912138 , rs 3790757 and rs 9659997 ) , we conducted a genetic association analysis of case - control samples ( 197 <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> patients and 337 controls ) in the Japanese population .
The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> dependence patients .
RESULTS : rs 6693503 was associated with <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> patients in the allele / genotype - wise analysis .
Moreover , this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction .
In the haplotype - wise analysis , we detected an association between two markers ( rs 6693503 and rs 1805054 ) and three markers ( rs 6693503 , rs 1805054 and rs 4912138 ) in HTR 6 and <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> patients , respectively .
CONCLUSION : HTR 6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> in the Japanese population .
Acute <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> after exposure to <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of acute <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 70 - year - old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia .
There was no evidence for viral , autoimmune , or metabolic causes of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
No other medications were involved except for <START:Chemical> dipyrone <END> for <START:Disease> analgesia <END> .
The <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U / L and the serum <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> reached a peak of 17 . 0 mg / dL .
There was slow improvement over 4 months .
Accidental reexposure by the patient to <START:Chemical> dipyrone <END> was uneventful .
DISCUSSION : The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles <START:Disease> halothane hepatitis <END> , which has a significant mortality rate .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Isoflurane <END> , a common anesthetic agent , can cause severe <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> .
Neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of <START:Chemical> mefloquine <END> .
This study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with <START:Chemical> mefloquine <END> .
Reactions consisted mainly of <START:Disease> seizures <END> , acute <START:Disease> psychoses <END> , <START:Disease> anxiety neurosis <END> , and major <START:Disease> disturbances of sleep - wake rhythm <END> .
Side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to severe .
In a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in Germany , it is estimated that one of 8 , 000 <START:Chemical> mefloquine <END> users suffers from such reactions .
The incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions , compared with one of 13 , 000 in the prophylaxis group , making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after <START:Chemical> mefloquine <END> treatment 60 times higher than after prophylaxis .
Therefore , certain limitations for <START:Disease> malaria <END> prophylaxis and treatment with <START:Chemical> mefloquine <END> are recommended .
Reversible <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> in a pediatric heart transplant recipient : case report .
<START:Chemical> Tacrolimus <END> is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation .
However , adverse effects include <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> .
Herein we describe transient <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> after heart transplantation .
The <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography .
Initially , allograft rejection was feared ; however , myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial <START:Disease> edema <END> and mild <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> ; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected .
The blood <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> concentration was higher than usual at that time ; thus , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> dosage was reduced .
<START:Disease> Myocardial hypertrophy <END> completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> and did not recur , as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy .
Thus , we conclude that <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> induces reversible <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> .
In patients receiving <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> therapy , blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement .
<START:Chemical> Ticlopidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report 2 cases of <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> , investigate its mechanism , and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases .
CASE SUMMARIES : Two patients developed prolonged <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> after receiving <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> following percutaneous coronary angioplasty , with complete remission during the follow - up period .
T - cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> was demonstrated in vitro in the patients , but not in healthy controls .
DISCUSSION : <START:Disease> Cholestatic hepatitis <END> is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> ; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature .
Our patients developed <START:Disease> jaundice <END> following treatment with <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> , which resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis <END> may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course , but complete remission was observed in all reported cases .
An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> .
The mechanisms of this <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> are unclear .
Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug ' s <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , as suggested by the T - cell stimulation study reported here .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Cholestatic hepatitis <END> is a rare adverse effect of <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> that may be immune mediated .
Patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell counts .
This complication will be observed even less often in the future as <START:Chemical> ticlopidine <END> is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent <START:Chemical> clopidogrel <END> .
Apparent cure of <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> by bone marrow transplantation .
We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RA <END> ) by bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in 2 patients .
BMT was used to treat severe <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> which was caused by <START:Chemical> gold <END> in one case and <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> in the other .
In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants ( representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy , respectively ) , the <START:Disease> RA <END> in each case has been completely quiescent .
Although short term remission of severe <START:Disease> RA <END> following BMT has been reported , these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available .
This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive <START:Disease> synovitis <END> .
Side effects of postoperative administration of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> into the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space .
PURPOSE : To assess the incidence of postoperative emetic side effects after the administration of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> into the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space at the end of routine <START:Disease> cataract <END> surgery .
SETTING : St . Luke ' s Hospital , Gwardamangia , Malta .
METHODS : A double - blind double - armed prospective study comprised 40 patients who had uneventful sutureless phacoemulsification under sub - Tenon ' s local infiltration of 3 mL of plain <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
At the end of the procedure , Group A ( n = 20 ) had 20 mg / 0 . 5 mL of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> and 10 mg / 0 . 5 mL of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> injected into the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space and Group B ( n = 20 ) had the same combination injected into the anterior sub - Tenon ' s space .
Postoperatively , all patients were assessed for symptoms of <START:Disease> nausea , vomiting <END> , and <START:Disease> headache <END> .
A chi - square test was used to assess the statistical significance of results .
RESULTS : Sixty percent in Group A developed <START:Disease> postoperative emetic symptoms <END> , <START:Disease> headache <END> , or both ; 1 patient in Group B developed symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS : The administration of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> in the posterior sub - Tenon ' s space was related to a high incidence of side effects including <START:Disease> nausea , vomiting <END> , and <START:Disease> headache <END> .
All adverse effects were self - limiting .
Pharmacological modulation of <START:Disease> pain <END> - related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in humans .
Abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system ( central sensitization ) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced <START:Disease> pain <END> sensitivity in the skin surrounding <START:Disease> tissue injury <END> ( <START:Disease> secondary hyperalgesia <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Secondary hyperalgesia <END> shares clinical characteristics with <START:Disease> neurogenic hyperalgesia <END> in patients with <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> .
Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization .
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> , a drug effective in <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> patients , on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states .
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in normal volunteers , we studied the <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> - induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> secondary hyperalgesia <END> .
The dose of <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> was 1 , 800 mg per os , in a single administration .
We found that ( i ) <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex , independently of the presence of central sensitization ; ( ii ) <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> reduced the activation in the brainstem , only during central sensitization ; ( iii ) <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> suppressed stimulus - induced deactivations , only during central sensitization ; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation .
The observed drug - induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal .
These findings indicate that <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation , thus supporting the concept that <START:Chemical> gabapentin <END> is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present .
<START:Disease> Tricuspid valve regurgitation <END> and <START:Chemical> lithium carbonate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in a newborn infant .
A newborn with massive <START:Disease> tricuspid regurgitation <END> , <START:Disease> atrial flutter <END> , <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> , and a high serum <START:Chemical> lithium <END> level is described .
This is the first patient to initially manifest <START:Disease> tricuspid regurgitation <END> and <START:Disease> atrial flutter <END> , and the 11 th described patient with <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> among infants exposed to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy .
Sixty - three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement .
<START:Chemical> Lithium carbonate <END> may be a factor in the increasing incidence of <START:Disease> congenital heart disease <END> when taken during early pregnancy .
It also causes <START:Disease> neurologic depression <END> , <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> , and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmia <END> when consumed prior to delivery .
Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> : correlation with <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 single - photon emission tomography .
It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to <START:Disease> coronary occlusion <END> and to critical <START:Disease> coronary stenoses <END> in the presence of <START:Disease> hyperemic <END> stimulation .
The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> .
The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) .
During a transient ( 20 - s ) <START:Disease> coronary occlusion <END> , a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced .
The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 74 ; p less than 0 . 002 ) .
During <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> , 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography .
The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild ( 0 % to 50 % ) reduction in <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> .
The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 61 ; p = 0 . 02 ) .
<START:Chemical> Thallium <END> - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> ; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) .
Thus , myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> .
The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 SPECT .
Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> in rats .
Rats with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> .
Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet ( 40 vs . 19 % ) , NX or HP + NX for another 8 weeks .
Corresponding non - <START:Chemical> lithium <END> pretreated groups were generated .
When comparing all <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treated versus non - <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - treated groups , <START:Chemical> lithium <END> caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or <START:Chemical> lithium <END> clearance .
Consequently , <START:Chemical> lithium <END> pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional <START:Chemical> Li <END> excretion .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> also caused <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and systolic <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in absence of <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> .
HP failed to accentuante progression of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels in <START:Chemical> lithium <END> pretreated rats .
NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which , however , was ameliorated by HP .
NX + HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in <START:Chemical> Li <END> - pretreated rats .
The results indicate that <START:Chemical> Li <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and arterial systolic <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
In this model of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli .
The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced , leaving the distal delivery unchanged . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Postpartum <START:Disease> psychosis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> .
Two multigravida patients with no prior <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> history were seen with postpartum <START:Disease> psychosis <END> , having received <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> for <START:Disease> inhibition of lactation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Bromocriptine <END> given in high doses has been associated with <START:Disease> psychosis <END> in patients receiving the drug for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
These cases demonstrate that <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> may cause <START:Disease> psychosis <END> even when given in low doses .
High incidence of <START:Disease> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> associated with <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> in Belgium .
<START:Disease> Primary pulmonary hypertension <END> is a rare , progressive and incurable disease , which has been associated with the intake of <START:Chemical> appetite suppressant <END> drugs .
The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> .
Thirty - five patients with <START:Disease> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months ( 1992 - 1994 ) in Belgium .
Exposure to <START:Chemical> appetite - suppressants <END> was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview .
Twenty - three of the patients had previously taken <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> , mainly <START:Chemical> fenfluramines <END> , as compared with only 5 of the controls ( 66 versus 6 % , p < 0 . 0001 ) .
Five patients died before the interview , all of them had taken <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> .
In 8 patients the diagnosis of <START:Disease> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> was uncertain , 5 of them had taken <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> .
The patients who had been exposed to <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> tended to be on average more severely ill , and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis .
A policy of unrestricted prescription of <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> may lead to a high incidence of associated <START:Disease> primary pulmonary hypertension <END> .
Intake of <START:Chemical> appetite suppressants <END> may accelerate the progression of the disease .
<START:Disease> Stroke <END> and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use .
The association of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use with hemorrhagic and <START:Disease> ischemic <END> <START:Disease> stroke <END> is based almost solely on data from case series .
The limited number of epidemiologic studies of <START:Disease> stroke <END> and use of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and / or minorities .
This case - control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California .
We attempted to identify all incident <START:Disease> strokes <END> in women ages 15 - 44 years during a 3 - year period using hospital admission and discharge records , emergency department logs , and payment requests for out - of - plan hospitalizations .
We selected controls , matched on age and facility of usual care , at random from healthy members of the health plan .
We obtained information in face - to - face interviews .
There were 347 confirmed <START:Disease> stroke <END> cases and 1 , 021 controls .
The univariate matched odds ratio for <START:Disease> stroke <END> in women who admitted to using <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> was 8 . 5 ( 95 % confidence interval = 3 . 6 - 20 . 0 ) .
After further adjustment for potential confounders , the odds ratio in women who reported using <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> was 7 . 0 ( 95 % confidence interval = 2 . 8 - 17 . 9 ) .
The use of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> is a strong risk factor for <START:Disease> stroke <END> in this socioeconomically heterogeneous , insured urban population .
<START:Chemical> Busulfan <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
A case of a <START:Chemical> busulfan <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhage cystitis <END> is reported .
Spontaneous resolution occurred following cessation of the drug .
The similarity between the histologic appearances of <START:Chemical> busulfan <END> <START:Disease> cystitis <END> and both radiation and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> is discussed and the world literature reviewed .
In view of the known tendency of <START:Chemical> busulfan <END> to induce cellular atypia and <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> in other sites , periodic urinary cytology is suggested in patients on long - term therapy .
Recurrent <START:Disease> dysosmia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pyrazinamide <END> can have adverse effects such as <START:Disease> hepatic toxicity <END> , <START:Disease> hyperuricemia <END> or digestive disorders .
In rare cases , alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> when combined with other drugs .
We report a case of reversible <START:Disease> olfactory disorder <END> related to <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> in a woman , with a positive rechallenge .
The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake .
<START:Disease> Dysosmia <END> disappeared completely after <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge .
The case was reported to the Tunisian Centre of Pharmacovigilance .
Efficacy and tolerability of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> in 3390 women with moderate <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> in women with moderate <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
DESIGN : The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of <START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> ( EXCEL ) Study , a multicenter , double - blind , diet - and placebo - controlled trial , in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily , or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks .
SETTING : Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States .
PATIENTS : Women ( n = 3390 ) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers .
MEASUREMENTS : Plasma total , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , and high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> , and <START:Chemical> triglycerides <END> ; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study .
RESULTS : Among women , <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> ( 20 to 80 mg / d ) produced sustained ( 12 - to 48 - week ) , dose - related changes ( P < 0 . 001 ) : decreases in LDL <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> ( 24 % to 40 % ) and <START:Chemical> triglycerides <END> ( 9 % to 18 % ) , and increases in HDL <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> ( 6 . 7 % to 8 . 6 % ) .
Depending on the dose , from 82 % to 95 % of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> - treated women achieved the National <START:Chemical> Cholesterol <END> Education Program goal of LDL <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> levels less than 4 . 14 mmol / L ( 160 mg / dL ) , and 40 % to 87 % achieved the goal of 3 . 36 mmol / L ( 130 mg / dL ) .
Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0 . 1 % of women and were dose dependent above the 20 - mg dose .
<START:Disease> Myopathy <END> , defined as muscle symptoms with <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal , was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> ( 80 mg ) .
Estrogen - replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> in women .
Experimental cranial <START:Disease> pain <END> elicited by <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> : a PET study .
Using a positron emission tomography ( PET ) study it was shown recently that in <START:Disease> migraine <END> without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the <START:Disease> headache <END> state , but not in the <START:Disease> headache <END> free interval .
It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack itself and represents the so called ' <START:Disease> migraine <END> generator ' .
To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental <START:Disease> pain <END> study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the <START:Disease> migraine <END> patients .
A small amount of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning <START:Disease> painful <END> sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve .
Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) were found bilaterally in the insula , in the anterior cingulate cortex , the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum .
Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned <START:Disease> migraine <END> study no brain stem activation was found in the acute <START:Disease> pain <END> state compared to the <START:Disease> pain <END> free state .
The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however , suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted <START:Disease> pain <END> as such , rather than in a specific type of <START:Disease> headache <END> as was suggested for <START:Disease> cluster headache <END> .
Effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with <START:Disease> aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> .
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) with prominent anti - inflammatory properties .
Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate .
Patients with <START:Disease> aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> SAH <END> ) were randomized to receive either <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> , 100 mg , three times a day ( <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> group , n = 9 ) or a weak NSAID , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> , 1 g , three times a day ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> group , n = 9 ) starting immediately after the diagnosis of <START:Disease> aneurysmal <END> <START:Disease> SAH <END> .
Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively .
Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first , third , and fifth postoperative mornings .
Maximal <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> induced by 6 microM of <START:Chemical> adenosine diphosphate <END> decreased after administration of <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> .
Aggregation was lower ( P < . 05 ) in the <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> group than in the <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day .
In contrast , maximal <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> increased in the <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> results ( P < . 05 ) .
One patient in the <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> group developed a postoperative intracranial <START:Disease> hematoma <END> .
Coagulation ( prothrombin time [ PT ] , activated partial thromboplastin time [ APPT ] , fibrinogen concentration , and antithrombin III [ AT III ] ) was comparable between the two groups .
<START:Chemical> Ketoprofen <END> but not <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> impaired platelet function in patients with <START:Disease> SAH <END> .
If <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> is used before surgery on cerebral <START:Disease> artery aneurysms <END> , it may pose an additional risk factor for <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
<START:Disease> Erectile dysfunction <END> occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat .
Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni - and bilateral injections of <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain .
Behavioral <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced penile erections were reduced ( 5 / 8 ) and increased ( 3 / 8 ) in uni - and bilateral lesioned animals .
Intracavernous pressures , following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve , decreased in lesioned animals .
Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology .
Concentration of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats .
Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> in rats and may serve as a model to study <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> is thought to be a result of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> , a <START:Chemical> benzisoxazole <END> derivative antipsychotic , has high <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 5 - HT 2 receptor blockade and dose - related D 2 receptor blockade .
The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> at low dosages .
With this low frequency of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> , it was thought the frequency of <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> might also be lowered .
A 73 - year - old woman developed <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> after monotherapy with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
The syndrome reversed after discontinuing <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and starting treatment with <START:Chemical> dantrolene <END> and <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> .
It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> does not ensure protection from <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate <END> - induced fulminant <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> in a pregnant woman .
A case report .
We report the case of a 19 - year - old Laotian patient affected by fulminant <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1 - month administration of <START:Chemical> quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate <END> .
After delivery , the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation .
The patient was in good condition 16 months after liver transplantation .
<START:Chemical> Quinidine <END> itself or <START:Chemical> phenylethylbarbiturate <END> may be responsible for fulminant <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> in this patient .
<START:Chemical> Low - molecular - weight heparin <END> for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves .
BACKGROUND : The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non - surgical interventions , and pregnancy .
<START:Chemical> Unfractionated heparin <END> ( <START:Chemical> UH <END> ) is currently the substitute for selected patients .
<START:Chemical> Low - molecular - weight heparin <END> ( <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> ) offers theoretical advantages over <START:Chemical> UH <END> , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to <START:Chemical> UH <END> in patients with prosthetic valves .
HYPOTHESIS : The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice .
METHODS : For this paper , the current medical literature on <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed .
RESULTS : There were eight series and six case reports .
None of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospective .
Data to establish the <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> risk were incomplete .
After excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short - term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b ) short - term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / periprocedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long - term , due to intolerance to OAC ( n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long - term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) .
The incidence rate of <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> was 0 . 9 % for all the studies and 0 . 5 , 0 , 20 , and 0 % in groups a , b , c , and d , respectively ; for <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> , the overall rate was 3 . 4 % ( 3 . 8 , 2 . 6 , 10 , and 0 % for the respective groups ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with mechanical heart valves , short - term <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> therapy compares favorably with <START:Chemical> UH <END> .
Data on mid - and long - term <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> administration in these patients are sparse .
Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> in patients with mechanical heart valves .
<START:Disease> Peripheral neuropathy <END> caused by high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> treatment in a patient with <START:Disease> acute myeloid leukemia <END> .
The central nervous system <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> is well recognized , but the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported .
A 49 - year - old Japanese man was diagnosed with <START:Disease> acute myeloid leukemia <END> .
After he achieved complete remission , he received high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> treatment ( 2 g / m 2 twice a day for 5 days ; total , 20 g / m 2 ) as consolidation therapy .
The first course of high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> resulted in no unusual symptoms , but on day 21 of the second course of treatment , the patient complained of <START:Disease> numbness <END> in his right foot .
Electromyogram and nerve - conduction studies showed <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> in both peroneal nerves .
This <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> was gradually resolving ; however , after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , the symptoms worsened , with the development of <START:Disease> graft - versus - host disease <END> , and the symptoms subsequently responded to <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> .
Although the mechanisms of <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> are still unclear , high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system , and auto / alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms .
<START:Chemical> Sorafenib <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> due to <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> .
A 65 - year - old man with advanced <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> was admitted due to continuing <START:Disease> chest pain <END> at rest .
Two weeks before his admission , <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> had been started .
He was diagnosed with non - ST - elevation <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> by laboratory data and electrocardiogram .
Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed <START:Disease> subendocardial infarction <END> .
However , there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography .
<START:Disease> Coronary artery spasm <END> was induced by a provocative test .
Cessation of <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> and administration of <START:Chemical> Ca <END> - channel blocker and <START:Chemical> nitrates <END> ameliorated his symptoms , but relapse occurred after resumption of <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> .
Addition of oral <START:Chemical> nicorandil <END> reduced his symptoms and maintained <START:Disease> stable angina <END> status .
We report the first case of <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> - induced <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sorafenib <END> is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival .
On the other hand , the Rho / ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> .
Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho / ROCK pathway by <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> use .
Massive <START:Disease> cerebral edema <END> associated with fulminant <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> in <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> : possible role of cranial decompression .
<START:Disease> Cerebral edema <END> may complicate the course of <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> .
Response to conventional therapy has been disappointing .
We present a patient with fatal <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> - induced <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> , with signs and symptoms of <START:Disease> cerebral edema <END> , unresponsive to conventional medical therapy .
Cranial decompression was carried out .
A justification of the need for further evaluation of cranial decompression in such patients is presented .
Phase II trial of <START:Chemical> vinorelbine <END> in metastatic <START:Disease> squamous cell esophageal carcinoma <END> .
European Organization for Research and Treatment of <START:Disease> Cancer <END> Gastrointestinal Treat <START:Disease> Cancer <END> Cooperative Group .
PURPOSE : To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of <START:Chemical> vinorelbine <END> ( <START:Chemical> VNB <END> ) administered as a single agent in metastatic <START:Disease> squamous cell esophageal carcinoma <END> .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Forty - six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy .
Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> - based chemotherapy were assessable for <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and response .
<START:Chemical> VNB <END> was administered weekly as a 25 - mg / m 2 short intravenous ( i . v . ) infusion .
RESULTS : Six of 30 patients ( 20 % ) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response ( PR ) ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 8 % to 39 % ) .
The median duration of response was 21 weeks ( range , 17 to 28 ) .
One of 16 patients ( 6 % ) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response ( CR ) of 31 weeks ' duration ( 95 % CI , 0 % to 30 % ) .
The overall response rate ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] criteria ) was 15 % ( CR , 2 % ; PR 13 % ; 95 % CI , 6 % to 29 % ) .
The median dose - intensity ( DI ) was 20 mg / m 2 / wk .
<START:Chemical> VNB <END> was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> occurred .
At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 <START:Disease> granulocytopenia <END> was seen in 59 % of patients .
A grade 2 or 3 <START:Disease> infection <END> occurred in 16 % of patients , but no toxic <START:Disease> deaths <END> occurred .
Other side effects were rare , and <START:Disease> peripheral neurotoxicity <END> has been minor ( 26 % grade 1 ) .
CONCLUSION : These data indicate that <START:Chemical> VNB <END> is an active agent in metastatic <START:Disease> esophageal squamous cell carcinoma <END> .
Given its excellent tolerance profile and low <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , further evaluation of <START:Chemical> VNB <END> in combination therapy is warranted .
Risk for <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> among users of <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> and <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> who underwent echocardiography before use of medication .
BACKGROUND : Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30 % to 38 % of users of <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> and <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> had <START:Disease> valvular disease <END> , these drugs were withdrawn from the market .
OBJECTIVE : To determine the risk for new or worsening <START:Disease> valvular abnormalities <END> among users of <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> or <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications .
DESIGN : Cohort study .
SETTING : Academic primary care practices .
PATIENTS : 46 patients who used <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> or <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy .
MEASUREMENTS : Follow - up echocardiography .
The primary outcome was new or worsening <START:Disease> valvulopathy <END> , defined as progression of either <START:Disease> aortic or mitral regurgitation <END> by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U . S . Food and Drug Administration criteria ( at least mild <START:Disease> aortic regurgitation <END> or moderate <START:Disease> mitral regurgitation <END> ) .
RESULTS : Two patients ( 4 . 3 % [ 95 % CI , 0 . 6 % to 14 . 8 % ] ) receiving <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> - <START:Chemical> phentermine <END> developed <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> .
One had baseline <START:Disease> bicuspid aortic valve <END> and mild <START:Disease> aortic regurgitation <END> that progressed to moderate regurgitation .
The second patient developed new moderate <START:Disease> aortic insufficiency <END> .
CONCLUSION : Users of diet medications are at risk for <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> .
However , the incidence may be lower than that reported previously .
Source of <START:Disease> pain <END> and primitive dysfunction in <START:Disease> migraine <END> : an identical site ?
Twenty common <START:Disease> migraine <END> patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind study .
Early onset <START:Disease> migraine <END> attacks were induced by <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group .
Subsequently 20 <START:Disease> migraine <END> patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> , received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas .
No early onset <START:Disease> migraine <END> was observed .
Thus the <START:Disease> migraine <END> - inducing effect of <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of <START:Disease> pain <END> , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a <START:Disease> migraine <END> crisis .
This is not consistent with a CNS origin of <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack .
A case of <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> .
Although <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> has been used for many <START:Disease> rheumatologic diseases <END> , <START:Disease> toxicity <END> limits its usefulness in many patients .
<START:Disease> Polymyositis <END> / <START:Disease> dermatomyositis <END> can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> treatment , but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear .
We report a patient with <START:Disease> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> , who developed <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> while receiving <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> therapy .
We described the special clinical course of the patient .
Patients receiving <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> / <START:Disease> dermatomyositis <END> .
Conformationally restricted analogs of <START:Chemical> BD 1008 <END> and an antisense <START:Chemical> oligodeoxynucleotide <END> targeting sigma 1 receptors produce anti - <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> effects in mice .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> ' s ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects .
Therefore , three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice : <START:Chemical> BD 1018 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 S - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] nonane <END> ) , <START:Chemical> BD 1063 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 4 - methylpiperazine <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> LR 132 <END> ( 1 R , 2 S - ( + ) - cis - N - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexylamine ) .
Competition binding assays demonstrated that all three compounds have high affinities for sigma 1 receptors .
The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma 2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> , opioid , <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) and <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors .
In behavioral studies , pre - treatment of mice with <START:Chemical> BD 1018 <END> , <START:Chemical> BD 1063 <END> , or <START:Chemical> LR 132 <END> significantly attenuated <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and lethality .
Moreover , post - treatment with <START:Chemical> LR 132 <END> prevented <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals .
In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists , the well - characterized sigma receptor agonist <START:Chemical> di - o - tolylguanidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DTG <END> ) and the novel sigma receptor agonist <START:Chemical> BD 1031 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 R - 1 - [ 2 - ( 3 , 4 - dichlorophenyl ) ethyl ] - 1 , 4 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] nonane <END> ) each worsened the behavioral <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
At doses where alone , they produced no significant effects on locomotion , <START:Chemical> BD 1018 <END> , <START:Chemical> BD 1063 <END> and <START:Chemical> LR 132 <END> significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors , an antisense <START:Chemical> oligodeoxynucleotide <END> against sigma 1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the <START:Disease> convulsive <END> and locomotor stimulatory effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
Together , the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced behaviors .
Cardioprotective effect of <START:Chemical> salvianolic acid A <END> on <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
The present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of <START:Chemical> salvianolic acid A <END> on <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
Hemodynamic parameters and lead II electrocardiograph were monitored and recorded continuously .
Cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measured .
Assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were performed .
<START:Chemical> Isoproterenol <END> - treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of <START:Chemical> lactate <END> dehydrogenase , <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> transaminase , <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase and <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> and significant decreases in the activities of <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase , catalase and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> peroxidase in serum and heart .
These rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure , maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure , and elevation of left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and ST - segment .
In addition , mitochondrial <START:Disease> respiratory dysfunction <END> characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and <START:Chemical> ADP <END> / O was observed in <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - treated rats .
Administration of <START:Chemical> salvianolic acid A <END> for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> and <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> and improved mitochondrial respiratory function .
The protective role of <START:Chemical> salvianolic acid A <END> against <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> was further confirmed by histopathological examination .
The results of our study suggest that <START:Chemical> salvianolic acid A <END> possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> therapy .
A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16 - month period .
<START:Chemical> Vancomycin <END> was curative in 95 % of 43 patients with proven <START:Disease> infection <END> .
Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions ; in three of these <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> was considered the likely cause .
Reactions included <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> ( 20 of 54 patients ) , <START:Disease> rash <END> ( 4 of 54 ) , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 4 of 50 ) , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> ( 1 of 50 ) and <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> ( 1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry ) .
<START:Disease> Thrombophlebitis <END> occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae ; <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> were confined to patients receiving an <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> plus <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> , administered appropriately , constitutes safe , effective therapy for <START:Disease> infections <END> caused by susceptible bacteria .
Combined androgen blockade - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> in <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> patients without bone involvement .
BACKGROUND : To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade ( CAB ) - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> in <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> patients without bone involvement .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Forty - two patients with biopsy - proven <START:Disease> prostatic adenocarcinoma <END> [ 26 with stage C ( T 3 N 0 M 0 ) and 16 with stage D 1 ( T 3 N 1 M 0 ) ] were included in this study .
All patients received CAB [ <START:Chemical> leuprolide acetate <END> ( <START:Chemical> LHRH - A <END> ) 3 . 75 mg , intramuscularly , every 28 days plus 250 mg <START:Chemical> flutamide <END> , tid , per Os ] and were evaluated for <START:Disease> anemia <END> by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post - CAB ) .
Hb , PSA and <START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> measurements were recorded .
Patients with stage D 2 - 3 disease , abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study .
The duration of the study was six months .
RESULTS : The mean hemoglobin ( Hb ) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14 . 2 g / dl to 14 . 0 g / dl , 13 . 5 g / dl , 13 . 2 g / dl and 12 . 7 g / dl at 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 months post - CAB , respectively .
Severe and clinically evident <START:Disease> anemia <END> of Hb < 11 g / dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients ( 14 . 3 % ) .
This CAB - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> was normochromic and normocytic .
At six months post - CAB , patients with severe <START:Disease> anemia <END> had a Hb mean value of 10 . 2 + / - 0 . 1 g / dl ( X + / - SE ) , whereas the other patients had mild <START:Disease> anemia <END> with Hb mean value of 13 . 2 + / - 0 . 17 ( X + / - SE ) .
The development of severe <START:Disease> anemia <END> at 6 months post - CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2 . 5 g / dl after 3 months of CAB ( p = 0 . 01 ) .
The development of severe CAB - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> in <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> patients did not correlate with T baseline values ( T < 3 ng / ml versus T > or = 3 ng / ml ) , with age ( < 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs ) , and clinical stage ( stage C versus stage D 1 ) .
Severe and clinically evident <START:Disease> anemia <END> was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections ( 3 times / week for 1 month ) of recombinant erythropoietin ( rHuEPO - beta ) .
CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that rHuEPO - beta correctable CAB - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> occurs in 14 . 3 % of <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> patients after 6 months of therapy .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> complicating <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> heart .
The present report describes a case of <START:Disease> eosinophilic myocarditis <END> complicating <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> .
The 47 - year - old female patient , known to have <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , was admitted with <START:Disease> biventricular failure <END> and managed aggressively with <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation .
On transthoracic echocardiogram , she had moderate <START:Disease> left ventricular dysfunction <END> with regional variability and moderate <START:Disease> mitral regurgitation <END> .
The recipient ' s heart showed the features of apical <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> with abundant eosinophils .
<START:Disease> Myocarditis <END> is rare and <START:Disease> eosinophilic myocarditis <END> is rarer .
It is likely that the <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> ( <START:Disease> eosinophilic <END> ) <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> was related to <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion therapy .
<START:Disease> Eosinophilic myocarditis <END> has been reported with an incidence of 2 . 4 % to 7 . 2 % in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy .
<START:Chemical> Succinylcholine <END> - induced <START:Disease> masseter muscle rigidity <END> during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body .
<START:Disease> Masseter muscle rigidity <END> during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of <START:Disease> malignant hyperthermia <END> .
The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of <START:Disease> masseter muscle rigidity <END> .
Here , we describe a case of severe <START:Disease> masseter muscle rigidity <END> ( <START:Disease> jaw of steel <END> ) after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Sch <END> ) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body .
Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat <START:Disease> malignant hyperthermia <END> .
Effect of direct intracoronary administration of <START:Chemical> methylergonovine <END> in patients with and without <START:Disease> variant angina <END> .
The effects of intracoronary administration of <START:Chemical> methylergonovine <END> were studied in 21 patients with <START:Disease> variant angina <END> and 22 patients with atypical <START:Disease> chest pain <END> and in others without <START:Disease> angina pectoris <END> ( control group ) .
<START:Chemical> Methylergonovine <END> was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms / min up to 50 micrograms .
In all patients with <START:Disease> variant angina <END> , <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> was provoked at a mean dose of 28 + / - 13 micrograms ( mean + / - SD ) .
In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized <START:Disease> spasm <END> occurred .
The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery .
The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery .
These results suggest that <START:Disease> spasm <END> provocation tests , which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of <START:Chemical> methylergonovine <END> , have a high sensitivity in <START:Disease> variant angina <END> and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries .
<START:Chemical> Ranitidine <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> in a cadaveric renal allograft .
<START:Chemical> Ranitidine <END> frequently is used for preventing peptic ulceration after renal transplantation .
This drug occasionally has been associated with acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> in native kidneys .
There are no similar reports with renal transplantation .
We report a case of <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> in a recipient of a cadaveric renal allograft presenting with acute allograft dysfunction within 48 hours of exposure to the drug .
The biopsy specimen showed pathognomonic features , including eosinophilic infiltration of the interstitial compartment .
Allograft function improved rapidly and returned to baseline after stopping the drug .
Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> , <START:Chemical> propafenone <END> , <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , and <START:Chemical> sparteine <END> .
A 47 - year - old patient suffering from <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> was admitted to the CCU in <START:Disease> shock <END> with III .
<START:Disease> AV block <END> , severe <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , and <START:Disease> impairment of ventricular function <END> .
One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> ( 100 mg t . i . d . and then 100 mg b . i . d . ) had been initiated .
Two days before admission <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> ( 60 mg b . i . d . ) was prescribed in addition .
Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> ( greater than 3000 ng / ml ) and <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> ( 526 ng / ml ) .
The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy .
Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> , <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , <START:Chemical> propafenone <END> ( since he had received this drug in the past ) , and <START:Chemical> sparteine <END> ( as a probe for the <START:Chemical> debrisoquine <END> / <START:Chemical> sparteine <END> type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism ) .
It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs , indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control .
Therefore , patients belonging to the poor - metabolizer phenotype of <START:Chemical> sparteine <END> / <START:Chemical> debrisoquine <END> polymorphism in drug metabolism , which constitutes 6 . 4 % of the German population , may experience <START:Disease> adverse drug reactions <END> when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone .
Moreover , the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients .
Characterization of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - induced <START:Disease> adenohypophyseal tumors <END> in the Fischer 344 rat .
<START:Disease> Pituitary tumors <END> were induced in F 344 female rats by chronic treatment with <START:Chemical> diethylstilbestrol <END> ( <START:Chemical> DES <END> , 8 - 10 mg ) implanted subcutaneously in silastic capsules .
Over a range of 1 - 150 days of <START:Chemical> DES <END> treatment , pairs of control and <START:Chemical> DES <END> - treated rats were sacrificed , and their pituitaries dissociated enzymatically into single - cell preparations .
The cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight , intracellular prolactin ( PRL ) content and subsequent release in primary culture , immunocytochemical PRL staining , density and / or size alterations via separation on Ficoll - Hypaque and by unit gravity sedimentation , and cell cycle analysis , after <START:Chemical> acriflavine <END> DNA staining , by laser flow cytometry .
Total cell yields from <START:Chemical> DES <END> - treated pituitaries increased from 1 . 3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 58 . 9 times control values by day 150 .
Intracellular PRL content ranged from 1 . 9 to 9 . 4 times control levels , and PRL release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls , after at least 8 days of <START:Chemical> DES <END> exposure .
Beyond 8 days of <START:Chemical> DES <END> exposure , the immunochemically PRL - positive proportion of cells increased to over 50 % of the total population .
Increased density and / or size and PRL content were indicated for the majority of the PRL cell population in both types of separation protocols .
All these effects of <START:Chemical> DES <END> were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized animals .
The data extend the findings of other investigators , further establishing the <START:Chemical> DES <END> - induced <START:Disease> tumor <END> as a model for study of PRL cellular control mechanisms .
Acute <START:Disease> low back pain <END> during intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> : a report of two cases .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent - onset <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:Disease> AF <END> ) and maintenance of sinus rhythm .
We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent - onset <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> , who experienced an acute devastating <START:Disease> low back pain <END> a few minutes after initiation of intravenous <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> loading .
Notably , this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature .
Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution .
<START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> - dependent <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl <START:Chemical> salt <END> - sensitive rats .
Blood pressure ( BP ) is more <START:Chemical> salt <END> sensitive in men than in premenopausal women .
In Dahl <START:Chemical> salt <END> - sensitive rats ( DS ) , high - <START:Chemical> salt <END> ( HS ) diet increases BP more in males than females .
In contrast to the systemic renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system , which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS , intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased , and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed .
In this study , the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS - induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> that also causes increases in BP and <START:Disease> renal injury <END> .
On a low - <START:Chemical> salt <END> ( LS ) diet , male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females .
HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS , which was prevented by castration .
Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet .
Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet .
HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP , protein and albumin excretion , and <START:Disease> glomerular sclerosis <END> in male DS rats , which were attenuated by castration .
<START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP , <START:Disease> renal injury <END> , and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet .
<START:Chemical> Testosterone <END> contributes to the development of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> renal injury <END> in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system .
<START:Disease> Compression neuropathy of the radial nerve <END> due to <START:Chemical> pentazocine <END> - induced <START:Disease> fibrous myopathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Fibrous myopathy <END> is a common , well - known side effect of repeated <START:Chemical> pentazocine <END> injection .
However , <START:Disease> compression neuropathy <END> due to fibrotic muscle affected by <START:Chemical> pentazocine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myopathy <END> has not previously been reported .
In a 37 - year - old woman with documented <START:Chemical> pentazocine <END> - induced <START:Disease> fibrous myopathy <END> of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three - week history of right wrist drop , electrodiagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps , in addition to the <START:Disease> fibrous myopathy <END> .
Surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the triceps .
Decompression and neurolysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function .
<START:Chemical> Paracetamol <END> - associated <START:Disease> coma <END> , <START:Disease> metabolic acidosis <END> , <START:Disease> renal and hepatic failure <END> .
A case of <START:Disease> metabolic acidosis <END> , <START:Disease> acute renal failure and hepatic failure <END> following <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> ingestion is presented .
The diagnostic difficulty at presentation is highlighted .
Continuous arteriovenous haemofiltration proved a valuable means of maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance .
The patient recovered .
<START:Chemical> Penicillamine <END> - induced rapidly progressive <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
A 67 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> presented rapidly progressive <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RPGN <END> ) after 5 months of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> ( 250 mg / day ) treatment .
Light microscopy study showed severe <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> with crescent formation in 60 % of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole .
Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG , IgA and C 3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium .
The patient was treated with <START:Chemical> steroid <END> pulse , plasmapheresis , <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> and <START:Chemical> antiplatelet agents <END> .
A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks .
This new case of <START:Disease> RPGN <END> in the course of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in these patients .
The prompt discontinuation of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case .
<START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> angiopathy <END> in rats .
The effect of high dose <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel .
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> D - pen <END> ) 500 mg / kg / day for 10 or 42 days .
Pair fed rats served as controls .
Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light - and transmission - electron microscopy ( TEM ) .
In addition , the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes , 24 and 48 hours after i . v . injection of human serum 131 I - albumin ( 131 I - HSA ) .
TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of <START:Chemical> D - pen <END> - treated rats , consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation .
In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall , together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells .
The aorta / serum - ratio and the radioactive build - up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131 I - HSA was reduced in animals treated with <START:Chemical> D - pen <END> for 42 days , indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant <START:Chemical> hyaluronate <END> .
The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by <START:Chemical> D - pen <END> , and no differences in aortic 131 I - HSA radioactivity or aorta / serum - ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection , indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by <START:Chemical> D - pen <END> treatment .
These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of <START:Chemical> D - pen <END> may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta , possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross - linking of collagen and elastin .
<START:Disease> Type B hepatitis <END> after needle - stick exposure : prevention with <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin .
Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> immune globulin ( HBIG ) and immune serum globulin ( ISG ) were examined in a randomized , double - blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing <START:Disease> type B hepatitis <END> after needle - stick exposure to <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBsAG <END> ) - positive donors .
Clinical <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> developed in 1 . 4 % of HBIG and in 5 . 9 % of ISG recipients ( P = 0 . 016 ) , and seroconversion ( anti - HBs ) occurred in 5 . 6 % and 20 . 7 % of them respectively ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
Mild and transient side - effects were noted in 3 . 0 % of ISG and in 3 . 2 % of HBIG recipients .
Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase ( DNAP ) and e antigen and antibody ( <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> ; anti - HBE ) .
Both DNAP and <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> - positive donors .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing <START:Disease> type B hepatitis <END> even when the analysis was confined to these two high - risk subgroups .
The efficacy of ISG in preventing <START:Disease> type B hepatitis <END> cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included .
Enhanced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> .
High doses of <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> increase <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> to <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ) .
In the present study , the possible enhancement by <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with <START:Chemical> chloralose <END> - <START:Chemical> urethane <END> .
<START:Chemical> Isoniazid <END> significantly increased <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> after <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , <START:Chemical> pindolol <END> , <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> and <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> , as well as after <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , but not after <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> or <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> .
Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with <START:Chemical> methylatropine <END> or previously vagotomised .
These results are compatible with interference by <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone .
Such interference could be exerted centrally , possibly at the nucleus ambiguus , or peripherally at the sinus node .
Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system proteins are altered in rats with <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NS <END> ) .
In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) levels of angiotensinogen ( Ao ) were analyzed with the slot - blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues : kidney , heart , brain , and adrenal gland from control , <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> , and pair - fed ( PF ) rats .
<START:Disease> NS <END> was induced by a single injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin amino - nucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) .
Although a great urinary excretion and half - normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after <START:Chemical> PAN <END> injection , when <START:Disease> NS <END> was clearly established , hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change .
Furthermore , the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6 , nor did its hepatic levels at days 1 , 3 , 5 , or 7 after <START:Chemical> PAN <END> injection .
These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute <START:Disease> NS <END> induced by <START:Chemical> PAN <END> .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in children with left - sided <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> .
Two children with <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> of the left kidney experienced severe <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> after irradiation to the <START:Disease> tumor <END> bed and conventional dosage of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> is attributed 1 ) to the fact that radiation fields for left <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> include the lower portion of the heart and 2 ) to the interaction of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and irradiation on cardiac muscle .
It is recommended that <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> dosage be sharply restricted in children with <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation .
<START:Disease> Renal Fanconi syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> myopathy <END> after liver transplantation : drug - related <START:Disease> mitochondrial cytopathy <END> ?
Advances in the field of transplantation provide a better quality of life and allow more favorable conditions for growth and development in children .
However , combinations of different therapeutic regimens require consideration of potential adverse reactions .
We describe a 15 - yr - old girl who had orthotopic liver transplantation because of <START:Disease> Wilson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> Tacrolimus <END> , <START:Chemical> MMF <END> , and <START:Chemical> steroids <END> were given as immunosuppressant .
<START:Chemical> Lamivudine <END> was added because of de nova <START:Disease> hepatitis B infection <END> during her follow - up .
Three yr after transplantation she developed <START:Disease> renal Fanconi syndrome <END> with severe <START:Disease> metabolic acidosis <END> , <START:Disease> hypophosphatemia <END> , <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> , and <START:Disease> aminoaciduria <END> .
Although <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> was suspected to be the cause of late post - transplant renal <START:Disease> acidosis <END> and was replaced by <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> , <START:Disease> acidosis <END> , and electrolyte imbalance got worse .
Proximal <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> has developed during her follow - up .
<START:Disease> Fanconi syndrome <END> , as well as <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , is well recognized in patients with <START:Disease> mitochondrial disorders <END> and caused by depletion of mtDNA .
We suggest that our patient ' s <START:Disease> tubular dysfunction <END> and <START:Disease> myopathy <END> may have resulted from <START:Disease> mitochondrial dysfunction <END> which is triggered by <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> and augmented by <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> .
A randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> for SSRI - induced female <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> .
The objective of this study was to determine whether <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> , an alpha - and beta - adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women , has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> .
Nineteen <START:Disease> sexually dysfunctional <END> women receiving either <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> , <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> , or <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> participated in an eight - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study of the effects of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> ( 50 mg ) on self - report measures of sexual desire , arousal , orgasm , and sexual satisfaction .
Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity / pleasure on 50 mg <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> 1 - hr prior to sexual activity , significant improvements in these measures , as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo .
These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo - controlled trials for this condition .
<START:Disease> Myasthenia gravis <END> presenting as weakness after <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> administration .
We studied a patient with no prior history of <START:Disease> neuromuscular disease <END> who became virtually <START:Disease> quadriplegic <END> after parenteral <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> administration for <START:Disease> preeclampsia <END> .
The serum <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> concentration was 3 . 0 mEq / L , which is usually well tolerated .
The <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> was stopped and she recovered over a few days .
While she was weak , 2 - Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise , suggesting <START:Disease> postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade <END> .
After her strength returned , repetitive stimulation was normal , but single fiber EMG revealed increased jitter and blocking .
Her <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor antibody level was markedly elevated .
Although <START:Disease> paralysis <END> after <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> administration has been described in patients with known <START:Disease> myasthenia gravis <END> , it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the disease .
Patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> should be suspected of having an underlying <START:Disease> disorder of neuromuscular transmission <END> .
High <START:Chemical> fat <END> diet - fed <START:Disease> obese <END> rats are highly sensitive to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Often , chemotherapy by <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> ) is limited due to life threatening <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> in patients during and posttherapy .
Recently , we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and <START:Chemical> triglycerides <END> and increased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation , <START:Chemical> ATP <END> synthesis , and upregulated JAK / STAT 3 pathway .
In the current study , we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40 % high <START:Chemical> fat <END> diet ( HFD ) , which induces <START:Disease> obesity <END> in male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 250 - 275 g ) , sensitizes to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
A LD ( 10 ) dose ( 8 mg <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> / kg , ip ) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> , <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> , lipid peroxidation , and 80 % mortality in the <START:Disease> obese <END> ( <START:Disease> OB <END> ) rats in the absence of any significant <START:Disease> renal or hepatic toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> doxorubicinol <END> ( toxic metabolite ) in the normal diet - fed ( ND ) and <START:Disease> OB <END> hearts .
Mechanistic studies revealed that <START:Disease> OB <END> rats are sensitized due to : ( 1 ) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 , ( 2 ) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor - alpha , ( 3 ) decreased plasma adiponectin levels , ( 4 ) decreased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation ( 666 . 9 + / - 14 . 0 nmol / min / g heart in ND versus 400 . 2 + / - 11 . 8 nmol / min / g heart in <START:Disease> OB <END> ) , ( 5 ) decreased mitochondrial <START:Chemical> AMP <END> - alpha 2 protein kinase , and ( 6 ) 86 % drop in cardiac <START:Chemical> ATP <END> levels accompanied by decreased <START:Chemical> ATP <END> / <START:Chemical> ADP <END> ratio after <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> administration .
Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS 3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK / STAT 3 pathway .
In conclusion , HFD - induced <START:Disease> obese <END> rats are highly sensitized to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial <START:Chemical> ATP <END> generation , increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK / STAT 3 pathway .
A cross - sectional evaluation of the effect of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in boys .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> on trabecular bone mineral density ( BMD ) in children and adolescents .
METHOD : Medically healthy 7 - to 17 - year - old males chronically treated , in a naturalistic setting , with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> were recruited for this cross - sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007 .
Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted .
The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review , and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record .
Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography , and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Hyperprolactinemia <END> was present in 49 % of 83 boys ( n = 41 ) treated with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> for a mean of 2 . 9 years .
Serum <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
As expected , bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity .
After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores , serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius ( P < . 03 ) .
Controlling for relevant covariates , we also found treatment with selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius ( P = . 03 ) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine ( P < . 05 ) .
These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non - Hispanic white patients .
Of 13 documented <START:Disease> fractures <END> , 3 occurred after <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and SSRIs were started , and none occurred in patients with <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : This is the first study to link <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents .
Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues .
Acute <START:Disease> vocal fold palsy <END> after acute <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> intoxication .
Acute <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> caused by a <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> is very rare and there is no report of it leading to <START:Disease> vocal fold palsy <END> .
A 49 - year - old woman was transferred to our department because of <START:Disease> quadriparesis <END> , lancinating <START:Disease> pain <END> , <START:Disease> sensory loss <END> , and <START:Disease> paresthesia <END> of the distal limbs .
One month previously , she had taken a single high dose of <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> ( 130 tablets of <START:Chemical> ALCOHOL <END> STOP TAB , Shin - Poong Pharm . Co . , Ansan , Korea ) in a suicide attempt .
She was not an alcoholic .
For the first few days after ingestion , she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate <START:Disease> ataxia <END> and <START:Disease> giddiness <END> .
She noticed <START:Disease> hoarseness <END> and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state .
A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> .
Laryngeal electromyography ( thyroarytenoid muscle ) showed ample denervation potentials .
Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation .
Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer .
This was a case of acute <START:Disease> palsy <END> of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and superimposed severe acute sensorimotor axonal <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> caused by high - dose <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> intoxication .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> in war / tropical surgery ( a final tribute to the racemic mixture ) .
A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients , aged from 6 weeks to 70 years , undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates .
Operations lasting up to 2 h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air / <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> only .
After premedication with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> and local anaesthesia , and induction with standard doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> , a maintenance dose of 10 - 20 microg / kg / min of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> proved safe and effective .
Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring , relying heavily on the heart rate .
<START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> , unless contraindicated or risky , remains the only necessary complementary drug to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> .
Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative <START:Disease> analgesia <END> .
An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h , <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects , especially in a hot climate .
Experience in war / tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life - saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where , e . g . amputation and rapid extrication were required .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> is accelerated by growth and <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> .
The present studies demonstrate that growth and <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> treatment enhance the extent of <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> in rats given sufficient doses of <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix Gla protein , a <START:Disease> calcification <END> inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall .
The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> in <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - treated rats .
Treatment for 2 weeks with <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> caused massive focal <START:Disease> calcification of the artery <END> media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal <START:Disease> calcification <END> in 42 - day - old rats .
In contrast , no <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> treatment .
To directly examine the importance of growth to <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> produced massive focal <START:Disease> calcification of the artery <END> media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> in the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .
Although the explanation for the association between <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> and growth status cannot be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> and susceptibility to <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> , with 30 % higher levels of serum <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .
This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> could be related to higher serum <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> levels .
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> and <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> in <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> .
High doses of <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> are known to cause <START:Disease> calcification of the artery <END> media in as little as 3 to 4 days .
High doses of the <START:Chemical> vitamin K <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> are also known to cause <START:Disease> calcification of the artery <END> media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week .
In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> administration dramatically increased the extent of <START:Disease> calcification <END> in the media of <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .
There was a close parallel between the effect of <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> dose on <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> and the effect of <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> dose on the elevation of serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> , which suggests that <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> may induce <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> through its effect on serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> .
Because <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> produced by <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> , the synergy between <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> is probably best explained by the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a <START:Disease> calcification <END> inhibitor .
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of <START:Disease> artery calcification <END> in rats treated with <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> plus <START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not <START:Chemical> gamma - carboxylated <END> .
These observations indicate that although the <START:Chemical> gamma - carboxyglutamate <END> residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a <START:Disease> calcification <END> inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at <START:Disease> calcification <END> sites .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> after conversion to <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> in renal transplant recipients .
<START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> SRL <END> ) is a new , potent immunosuppressive agent .
More recently , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> has been reported as a consequence of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> therapy , although the mechanism has remained unclear .
We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients , who developed or displayed increased <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> after <START:Chemical> SRL <END> conversion .
The patient cohort ( 14 men , 11 women ) was treated with <START:Chemical> SRL <END> as conversion therapy , due to <START:Disease> chronic allograft nephropathy <END> ( <START:Disease> CAN <END> ) ( n = 15 ) <START:Disease> neoplasia <END> ( n = 8 ) ; <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> , Four <START:Disease> skin cancers <END> , One <START:Disease> intestinal tumors <END> , One <START:Disease> renal cell carsinom <END> ) or BK virus <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> ( n = 2 ) .
<START:Chemical> SRL <END> was started at a mean of 78 + / - 42 ( 15 to 163 ) months after transplantation .
Mean follow - up on <START:Chemical> SRL <END> therapy was 20 + / - 12 ( 6 to 43 ) months .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> increased from 0 . 445 ( 0 to 1 . 5 ) g / d before conversion to 3 . 2 g / dL ( 0 . 2 to 12 ) after conversion ( P = 0 . 001 ) .
Before conversion 8 ( 32 % ) patients had no <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , whereas afterwards all patients had <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
In 28 % of patients <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> remained unchanged , whereas it increased in 68 % of patients .
In 40 % it increased by more than 100 % .
Twenty - eight percent of patients showed increased <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> to the <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> range .
Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes : One <START:Disease> membranoproliferative glomerulopathy <END> and <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> .
These patients showed persistently good graft function .
Serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> values did not change significantly : 1 . 98 + / - 0 . 8 mg / dL before <START:Chemical> SRL <END> therapy and 2 . 53 + / - 1 . 9 mg / dL at last follow - up ( P = . 14 ) .
Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis .
Five patients displayed <START:Disease> CAN <END> and <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> .
Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1 . 26 ( 0 . 5 to 3 . 5 ) g / d before and 4 . 7 ( 3 to 12 ) g / d after conversion ( P = . 01 ) .
Mean serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> level before conversion was 2 . 21 mg / dL and thereafter , 4 . 93 mg / dL ( P = . 02 ) .
Heavy <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was common after the use of <START:Chemical> SRL <END> as rescue therapy for renal transplantation .
Therefore , conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced <START:Disease> CAN <END> and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under <START:Chemical> SRL <END> treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy .
Pyeloureteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation : a case report .
The etiology of <START:Disease> pyeloureteritis cystica <END> has long been attributed to chronic <START:Disease> infection <END> and <START:Disease> inflammation <END> .
A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography .
There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent <START:Disease> infection <END> in this patient .
The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy for suspected pelvic <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation .
The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true <START:Disease> pyeloureteritis cystica <END> and <START:Disease> submucosal hemorrhage <END> .
Long term audiological evaluation of <START:Disease> beta - thalassemic <END> patients .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to identify the incidence and to monitor the progression of <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> in children and young adults with <START:Disease> beta - thalassemia <END> major .
METHODS : One hundred and four ( 104 ) patients aged 6 - 35 years ( mean 17 , 2 years ) participated in the study .
All patients were on a regular transfusion - chelation program maintaining a mean hemoglobin level of 9 . 5 gr / dl .
Subjects were receiving <START:Chemical> desferrioxamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ) chelation treatment with a mean daily dose of 50 - 60 mg / kg , 5 - 6 days a week during the first six years of the study , which was then reduced to 40 - 50 mg / kg for the following eight years .
Patients were followed for 8 - 14 years .
RESULTS : Overall , 21 out of 104 patients ( 20 . 2 % ) presented with high frequency <START:Disease> sensorineural hearing loss <END> ( <START:Disease> SNHL <END> ) , either unilateral or bilateral .
No <START:Disease> ototoxic <END> factor , other than <START:Chemical> DFO <END> , was present in any of the patients .
Patients with <START:Disease> SNHL <END> presented with relatively lower serum ferritin levels than those with normal hearing , however , no statistically significant difference was observed .
Subjects with <START:Disease> SNHL <END> were submitted to <START:Chemical> DFO <END> reduction or temporary withdrawal .
Following intervention , 7 out of 21 affected patients recovered , 10 remained stable and 4 demonstrated aggravation .
CONCLUSION : The findings are indicative of <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ' s contributing role in the development of <START:Disease> hearing impairment <END> .
Regular audiologic evaluation is imperative in all <START:Disease> thalassemic <END> patients so that early changes may be recognized and treatment may be judiciously adjusted in order to prevent or reverse <START:Disease> hearing impairment <END> .
<START:Disease> Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oxacillin <END> .
A 67 - year - old man who was treated with <START:Chemical> oxacillin <END> for one week because of <START:Disease> Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia <END> , developed <START:Disease> renal failure <END> and diffuse , symmetric , palpable <START:Disease> purpuric lesions <END> on his feet .
<START:Disease> Necrotic blisters <END> were noted on his fingers .
Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of <START:Disease> leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Oxacillin <END> was discontinued and patient was treated with <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
The <START:Disease> rash <END> disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal .
<START:Disease> Leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> presents as palpable <START:Disease> purpura <END> of the lower extremities often accompanied by <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> , and <START:Disease> renal involvement <END> .
Etiologic factors or associated disorders include <START:Disease> infections <END> , medications , <START:Disease> collagen vascular disease <END> and <START:Disease> neoplasia <END> .
However , in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified .
Usually it is a self - limited disorder , but <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> therapy may be needed in life - threatening cases since early treatment with <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> in severe cases can prevent complications .
<START:Chemical> Oxacillin <END> should be included among the drugs that can cause <START:Disease> leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> .
A diet promoting <START:Disease> sugar dependency <END> causes <START:Disease> behavioral cross - sensitization <END> to a low dose of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to <START:Disease> drug dependency <END> .
The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show <START:Disease> behavioral cross - sensitization <END> to a low dose of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10 % <START:Chemical> sucrose <END> solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days .
Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access .
Beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow .
Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .
The animals that had experienced cyclic <START:Chemical> sucrose <END> and chow were <START:Disease> hyperactive <END> in response to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % <START:Chemical> sucrose <END> and chow followed by <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> injection , cyclic chow followed by <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> injection , ad libitum chow with <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> , or cyclic 10 % <START:Chemical> sucrose <END> and chow with a saline injection ) .
These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> system .
Acute <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ) - loaded <START:Chemical> cyanoacrylate <END> nanoparticles .
Acute <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - loaded nanoparticle ( DXNP ) <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> .
In normal rats , 2 / 6 rats given free <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DX <END> ) ( 5 mg / kg ) died within one week , whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived .
A 3 times higher <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with <START:Chemical> DX <END> .
Free NP did not provoke any <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
Two hr post - injection , DXNP was 2 . 7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free <START:Chemical> DX <END> ( p < 0 . 025 ) .
In rats with immune experimental <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> , 5 / 6 rats given <START:Chemical> DX <END> died within 7 days , in contrast to animals treated by DXNP , NP , or untreated , which all survived .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> appeared in all series , but was 2 - 5 times more intense ( p > 0 . 001 ) and prolonged after <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> treatment ( 400 - 700 mg / day ) , without significant difference between DXNP and <START:Chemical> DX <END> .
Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls .
These results demonstrate that , in these experimental conditions , DXNP killed less animals than free <START:Chemical> DX <END> , despite of an enhanced <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> of the former .
Both effects ( better survival and <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> ) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system , including mesangial cells .
<START:Disease> Intracranial aneurysms <END> and <START:Disease> cocaine abuse <END> : analysis of prognostic indicators .
OBJECTIVE : The outcome of <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> associated with <START:Disease> cocaine abuse <END> is reportedly poor .
However , no study in the literature has reported the use of a statistical model to analyze the variables that influence outcome .
METHODS : A review of admissions during a 6 - year period revealed 14 patients with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - related <START:Disease> aneurysms <END> .
This group was compared with a control group of 135 patients with <START:Disease> ruptured aneurysms <END> and no history of <START:Disease> cocaine abuse <END> .
Age at presentation , time of ictus after intoxication , Hunt and Hess grade of <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> , size of the <START:Disease> aneurysm <END> , location of the <START:Disease> aneurysm <END> , and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score were assessed and compared .
RESULTS : The patients in the study group were significantly younger than the patients in the control group ( P < 0 . 002 ) .
In patients in the study group , all <START:Disease> aneurysms <END> were located in the anterior circulation .
The majority of these <START:Disease> aneurysms <END> were smaller than those of the control group ( 8 + / - 6 . 08 mm versus 11 + / - 5 . 4 mm ; P = 0 . 05 ) .
The differences in mortality and morbidity between the two groups were not significant .
Hunt and Hess grade ( P < 0 . 005 ) and age ( P < 0 . 007 ) were significant predictors of outcome for the patients with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - related <START:Disease> aneurysms <END> .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> use predisposed <START:Disease> aneurysmal rupture <END> at a significantly earlier age and in much smaller <START:Disease> aneurysms <END> .
Contrary to the published literature , this group did reasonably well with aggressive management .
Salvage therapy with <START:Chemical> nelarabine <END> , <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in relapsed / refractory paediatric <START:Disease> T - cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphoma <END> .
A combination of 5 d of <START:Chemical> nelarabine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AraG <END> ) with 5 d of <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> ( <START:Chemical> VP <END> ) and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CPM <END> ) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed <START:Disease> T - cell leukaemia or lymphoma <END> .
The most common side effects attributable to the <START:Chemical> AraG <END> included Grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> and <START:Disease> musculoskeletal pain <END> .
<START:Disease> Haematological toxicity <END> was greater for the combination than <START:Chemical> AraG <END> alone , although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies .
All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of <START:Chemical> AraG <END> / <START:Chemical> VP <END> / <START:Chemical> CPM <END> .
Our experience supports the safety of giving <START:Chemical> AraG <END> as salvage therapy in synchrony with <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> , although <START:Disease> neurological toxicity <END> must be closely monitored .
Differential modulation by <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> of alpha 2 - adrenergic and I 1 - <START:Chemical> imidazoline <END> receptor - mediated <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in female rats .
We have recently shown that <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> negatively modulates the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> ( mixed alpha 2 - / I 1 - receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction .
The present study investigated whether this effect of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> involves interaction with alpha 2 - and / or I 1 - receptors .
Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of <START:Chemical> rilmenidine <END> ( 600 microg / kg ) or <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I 1 - and alpha 2 - receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx ) Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> replacement .
Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed : the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat - to - beat intervals ( SDRR ) and the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability .
In sham - operated rats , <START:Chemical> rilmenidine <END> or <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> elicited similar <START:Disease> hypotension <END> that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure .
SDRR was reduced only by <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> .
Ovx significantly enhanced the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response to <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> , in contrast to no effect on <START:Chemical> rilmenidine <END> <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The enhanced <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and <START:Disease> a reduced locomotor activity <END> .
Estrogen replacement ( <START:Chemical> 17 beta - estradiol <END> subcutaneous pellet , 14 . 2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> to sham - operated levels .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> downregulates alpha 2 - but not I 1 - receptor - mediated <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in <START:Chemical> alpha - methyldopa <END> - <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> interaction .
Antagonism of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced sedative effects by <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> in patients after surgery under lumbar epidural block .
A double - blind placebo - controlled investigation of efficacy and safety .
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> and a placebo in reversing <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced effects after surgery under epidural block , and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> .
Fifty - seven patients were sedated with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> for surgery under epidural anaesthesia .
Antagonism of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced effects by <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> was investigated postoperatively in a double - blind placebo - controlled trial .
The patient ' s subjective assessment of mood rating , an objective test of performance , a test for <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug .
No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating , <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , or vital signs .
The <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug .
There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site .
mToR inhibitors - induced <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> : mechanisms , significance , and management .
Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ( mToR ) inhibitors , especially <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> , in renal transplant recipients with <START:Disease> chronic allograft nephropathy <END> .
Because <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome , many studies focused on this adverse event during the past years .
Whether <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was due to <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained unsolved until high range <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> has been observed during <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> de novo .
Podocyte injury and focal segmental <START:Disease> glomerulosclerosis <END> have been related to mToR inhibition in some patients , but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypothetic .
We discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of mToR blockade - induced <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
The effects of short - term <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> therapy on fibrinolysis markers : TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1 .
BACKGROUND : Markers of fibrinolysis , thrombin - activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor ( TAFI ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , and plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( PAI - 1 ) levels were studied for the evaluation of short - term effects of <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> administration in postmenopausal women .
METHODS : Thirty - nine postmenopausal women with <START:Disease> osteopenia <END> or <START:Disease> osteoporosis <END> were included in this prospective , controlled clinical study .
Twenty - five women were given <START:Chemical> raloxifene hydrochloride <END> ( 60 mg / day ) plus <START:Chemical> calcium <END> ( 500 mg / day ) .
Age - matched controls ( n = 14 ) were given only <START:Chemical> calcium <END> .
Plasma TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits .
Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon ' s test .
Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated .
RESULTS : Three months of <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations ( 16 % change , P < 0 . 01 ) , and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations ( 25 % change , P < 0 . 05 ) .
A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of <START:Disease> amenorrhea <END> ( P < 0 . 05 ; r = 0 . 33 ) .
CONCLUSION : We suggest that the increased risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> due to <START:Chemical> raloxifene <END> treatment may be related to increased tPA levels , but not TAFI levels .
Evidence for an involvement of D 1 and D 2 <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors in mediating <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> in rats .
Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced locomotor stimulation .
In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> in rats was examined .
In addition , the role of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors in mediating <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D 1 and D 2 <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor antagonists on activity induced by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> ( 1 . 0 mg / kg ) caused a significant <START:Disease> increase in locomotor activity <END> in rats that were habituated to the test environment , but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment .
The stimulant action of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist <START:Chemical> mecamylamine <END> but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> , indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> was blocked by the selective D 1 antagonist <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> , the selective D 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> raclopride <END> and the D 1 / D 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> .
Pretreatment with the D 2 agonist <START:Chemical> PHNO <END> enhanced <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> , whereas the D 1 agonist <START:Chemical> SKF 38393 <END> had no effect .
The results indicate that acute <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> injection induces a pronounced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> in rats habituated to the test environment .
The effect appears to be mediated by central <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both D 1 and D 2 <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors .
<START:Chemical> Suxamethonium <END> induced prolonged <START:Disease> apnea <END> in a patient receiving electroconvulsive therapy .
<START:Chemical> Suxamethonium <END> causes prolonged <START:Disease> apnea <END> in patients in whom pseudocholinesterase enzyme gets deactivated by <START:Chemical> organophosphorus ( OP ) poisons <END> .
Here , we present a similar incident in a severely <START:Disease> depressed <END> patient who received electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) .
Prolonged <START:Disease> apnea <END> in our case ensued because the information about suicidal attempt by <START:Chemical> OP compound <END> was concealed from the treating team .
rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson disease <END> .
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> are unclear .
Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) over the supplementary motor area ( SMA ) in a group of patients with advanced <START:Disease> Parkinson disease <END> , the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> state induced by continuous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> infusion .
rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce <START:Disease> drug - induced dyskinesias <END> , whereas 5 - Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase .
Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> treated <START:Disease> immunodeficient <END> mice .
The <START:Disease> anaemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> 3 ' - azido - 3 ' dideoxythymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) is poorly understood .
We have used a murine model of <START:Disease> AIDS <END> , <START:Disease> infection <END> of female C 57 BL / 6 mice with LP - BM 5 murine <START:Disease> leukaemia <END> ( MuLV ) virus , to determine if <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> anaemia <END> is due , in part , to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors ( BFU - e ) to erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
Mice in the early stage of LP - BM 5 MuLV disease were given <START:Chemical> AZT <END> in their drinking water at 1 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg / ml .
<START:Chemical> AZT <END> produced <START:Disease> anaemia <END> in both groups , in a dose - dependent fashion .
Despite the <START:Disease> anaemia <END> , the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU - e in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> treated mice increased up to five - fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment .
Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving <START:Chemical> AZT <END> for 15 d than for infected , untreated mice .
By day 30 , sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU - e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals .
The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> treated mice were appropriate for the degree of <START:Disease> anaemia <END> observed when compared with <START:Chemical> phenylhydrazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PHZ <END> ) treated mice .
The numbers of BFU - e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> and <START:Chemical> PHZ <END> treated mice with similar degrees of <START:Disease> anaemia <END> .
However , <START:Disease> reticulocytosis <END> was inappropriate for the degree of <START:Disease> anaemia <END> observed in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> treated infected mice .
<START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced peripheral <START:Disease> anaemia <END> in the face of increased numbers of BFU - e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation .
<START:Disease> Pheochromocytoma <END> unmasked by <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To describe the unmasking of <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> in a patient treated with <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 42 - year - old white man developed acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> with severe <START:Disease> headache <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> 2 hours after the first doses of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> 100 mg and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> 100 mg . Both drugs were immediately discontinued , and the patient recovered after subsequent <START:Chemical> nicardipine <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> treatment .
Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass , and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> .
DISCUSSION : Drug - induced symptoms of <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> are often associated with the use of substituted <START:Chemical> benzamide <END> drugs , but the underlying mechanism is unknown .
In our case , use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> crisis and <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> therapy .
CONCLUSIONS : As of March 24 , 2005 , this is the first reported case of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> - and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> crisis in a patient with <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> .
Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> and <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> .
Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> DCM <END> ) and <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> occur in many <START:Disease> HIV - infected <END> individuals , resulting in symptomatic <START:Disease> heart failure <END> in up to 5 % of patients .
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of <START:Disease> acquired immunodeficiency syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> AIDS <END> ) , but has resulted in an increase in <START:Disease> cardiac and skeletal myopathies <END> .
METHODS AND RESULTS : In order to investigate whether the HAART component <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 ' - azido - 2 ' , 3 ' - deoxythymidine <END> ; <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of <START:Disease> DCM <END> , 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium : FasL Tg ) and non - transgenic ( NTg ) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ( 0 , 0 . 07 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 7 mg / ml ) .
After 6 weeks , cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods .
NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - treated FasL Tg mice developed <START:Disease> cardiac dilation <END> and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner , with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles .
These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL , as well as increased activation of caspase 3 , translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere , and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis .
These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization , as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity .
CONCLUSIONS : The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium , as identified in HIV - positive patients , might increase the susceptibility to HAART - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> due to activation of apoptotic pathways , resulting in <START:Disease> cardiac dilation and dysfunction <END> .
An extremely rare case of <START:Disease> delusional parasitosis <END> in a <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> patient during <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha - 2 b <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> treatment .
During treatment of <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> patients with interferon and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , a lot of side effects are described .
Twenty - three percent to 44 % of patients develop <START:Disease> depression <END> .
A minority of patients evolve to <START:Disease> psychosis <END> .
To the best of our knowledge , no cases of <START:Disease> psychogenic parasitosis <END> occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature .
We present a 49 - year - old woman who developed a <START:Disease> delusional parasitosis <END> during treatment with <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha - 2 b <END> weekly and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools .
This could not be confirmed by any technical examination .
All the complaints disappeared after stopping <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha - 2 b <END> and reappeared after restarting it .
She had a complete sustained viral response .
Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - treated monkeys .
A group of four monkeys was rendered <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> with the toxin <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> .
They were then treated chronically with <START:Chemical> L - DOPA / benserazide <END> 50 / 12 . 5 mg / kg given orally daily for 2 months .
This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect , but all animals manifested <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> were then tested in combination with <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> to see if the <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> movements would be modified .
Several drugs , including <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , <START:Chemical> physostigmine <END> , <START:Chemical> methysergide <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - MDOT <END> , <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , and <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> , markedly reduced the <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> movements but at the cost of a return of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> symptomatology .
However , <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> and <START:Chemical> meperidine <END> reduced predominantly the <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> movements .
<START:Chemical> Baclofen <END> was also useful in one monkey against a more <START:Disease> dystonic <END> form of <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Atropine <END> converted the <START:Disease> dystonic <END> movements into <START:Disease> chorea <END> .
Deaths from local anesthetic - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in mice .
Median convulsant ( CD 50 ) and median lethal ( LD 50 ) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
The CD 50 and LD 50 , respectively , were 57 . 7 and 58 . 7 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , 111 . 0 and 133 . 1 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> , and 243 . 4 and 266 . 5 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> chloroprocaine <END> .
When given intraperitoneally , <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> thus was only about twice as toxic as <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and four times as toxic as <START:Chemical> chloroprocaine <END> .
<START:Disease> Convulsions <END> always preceded death , except after precipitous <START:Disease> cardiopulmonary arrest <END> from extreme doses .
A CD 50 dose of local anesthetic ( causing <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in 50 % of mice ) was fatal in 90 % of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , in 57 % of the <START:Chemical> chloroprocaine <END> group , and in 6 % of the <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> group .
The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated <START:Disease> convulsions <END> present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated .
<START:Disease> Cardiac toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> .
Report of a case of spontaneous <START:Disease> angina <END> .
We report a case of a patient with <START:Disease> colon carcinoma <END> and liver <START:Disease> metastasis <END> who presented <START:Disease> chest pain <END> after <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) administration .
Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in <START:Disease> Prinzmetal ' s angina <END> , and <START:Disease> chest pain <END> promptly resolved with <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> .
These data suggest that <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> may be the cause of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> due to <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> , and that <START:Chemical> calcium <END> antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Possible <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> related to concomitant treatment with <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> .
A 74 - year - old man with <START:Disease> depressive symptoms <END> was admitted to a <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> hospital due to <START:Disease> insomnia <END> , <START:Disease> loss of appetite <END> , exhaustion , and <START:Disease> agitation <END> .
Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and 1 . 2 mg <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> .
On the 10 th day of <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> treatment , the patient exhibited marked <START:Disease> psychomotor retardation <END> , disorientation , and severe <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> with <START:Disease> tremors <END> .
The patient had a <START:Disease> fever <END> ( 38 . 2 degrees C ) , fluctuating blood pressure ( between 165 / 90 and 130 / 70 mg mm Hg ) , and severe <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> .
Laboratory tests showed an elevation of <START:Chemical> creatine <END> phosphokinase ( 2218 IU / L ) , <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> aminotransferase ( 134 IU / L ) , <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase ( 78 IU / L ) , and BUN ( 27 . 9 mg / ml ) levels .
The patient received <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> to treat his symptoms .
7 days later , the <START:Disease> fever <END> disappeared and the patient ' s serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L ) .
This patient presented with symptoms of <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NMS <END> ) , thus demonstrating that <START:Disease> NMS <END> - like symptoms can occur after combined <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> treatment .
The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case , indicating a probable relationship between the patient ' s <START:Disease> NMS <END> - like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case .
The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected .
Several risk factors for <START:Disease> NMS <END> should be noted in elderly <START:Disease> depressive <END> patients whose symptoms often include <START:Disease> dehydration <END> , <START:Disease> agitation <END> , <START:Disease> malnutrition <END> , and exhaustion .
Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from <START:Disease> depression <END> .
Evaluation of the anticocaine monoclonal antibody <START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> as an immunotherapy for <START:Disease> cocaine overdose <END> .
The illicit use of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> continues in epidemic proportions and treatment for <START:Disease> cocaine overdose <END> remains elusive .
Current protein - based technology offers a new therapeutic venue by which antibodies bind the drug in the blood stream , inactivating its toxic effects .
The therapeutic potential of the anticocaine antibody <START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> was examined using a model of <START:Disease> cocaine overdose <END> .
Swiss albino mice prepared with intrajugular catheters were tested in photocell cages after administration of 93 mg / kg ( LD 50 ) of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> infusions ranging from 30 to 190 mg / kg .
<START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> was delivered 30 min before , concomitantly or 3 min after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> treatment .
Significant blockade of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> was observed with the higher dose of <START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> ( 190 mg / kg ) , where premorbid behaviors were reduced up to 40 % , <START:Disease> seizures <END> up to 77 % and <START:Disease> death <END> by 72 % .
Importantly , <START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> prevented <START:Disease> death <END> even post - <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> injection .
The results support the important potential of <START:Chemical> GNC 92 H 2 <END> as a therapeutic tool against <START:Disease> cocaine overdose <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dup 753 <END> prevents the development of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
The appearance of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndromes <END> such as <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> hypoalbuminemia <END> , <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> and increase in <START:Chemical> blood nitrogen urea <END> , induced in rats by injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> was markedly inhibited by oral administration of <START:Chemical> Dup 753 <END> ( <START:Chemical> losartan <END> ) , a novel <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> receptor antagonist , at a dose of 1 or 2 mg / kg per day .
The results suggest a possible involvement of the renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system in the development of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
Macula <START:Disease> toxicity <END> after intravitreal <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> .
BACKGROUND : Although intravitreal <START:Chemical> aminoglycosides <END> have substantially improved visual prognosis in <START:Disease> endophthalmitis <END> , macular <START:Disease> infarction <END> may impair full visual recovery .
METHODS : We present a case of presumed <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> <START:Disease> retinal toxicity <END> following treatment with <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> and <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> for alpha - haemolytic <START:Disease> streptococcal endophthalmitis <END> .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Endophthalmitis <END> resolved with improvement in visual acuity to 6 / 24 at three months .
Fundus <START:Chemical> fluorescein <END> angiography confirmed macular capillary closure and <START:Disease> telangiectasis <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Currently accepted intravitreal antibiotic regimens may cause <START:Disease> retinal toxicity <END> and macular <START:Disease> ischaemia <END> .
Treatment strategies aimed at avoiding <START:Disease> retinal toxicity <END> are discussed .
Fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> following topical administration of ophthalmic <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> .
A 73 - year - old woman died of <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> less than two months after undergoing <START:Disease> cataract <END> extraction and beginning topical therapy with <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> .
The first signs of <START:Disease> pancytopenia <END> began within one month of the surgery .
The pattern of the <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> was associated with an idiosyncratic response to <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> .
This was the second report of fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> after topical treatment with <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> for ocular conditions , although two cases of reversible <START:Disease> bone marrow hypoplasia <END> have also been reported .
Any other suspected cases of <START:Disease> ocular toxicity <END> associated with topically applied <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> should be reported to the National Registry of Drug - Induced Ocular Side Effects , Oregon Health Sciences University , Portland , OR 97201 .
<START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> and <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> as a symptom of central <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> are a known but poorly described side effect of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> .
Most cases of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> have been reported with other mental status changes .
METHODS : The authors interviewed six persons with <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> in the presence of a clear sensorium .
All patients were receiving high - dose <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> occurred only when the patient ' s eyes were closed and , in all but one case , were reported as disturbing or frightening .
Underreporting of these <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> by patients is likely .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> may be the sole or first manifestation of <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related .
The clinician should be alerted for possible <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> , which may occur without other signs of <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
" Eyes - closed " <START:Disease> hallucinatory <END> experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation .
Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence .
Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear .
If <START:Disease> agitation <END> becomes marked , high - potency neuroleptics ( i . e . , <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ) may be effective .
<START:Disease> Learning and memory deficits <END> in <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> users and their neural correlates during a face - learning task .
It has been consistently shown that <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> users display <START:Disease> impairments in learning and memory <END> performance .
In addition , working memory processing in <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and / or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
Using functional imaging and a face - learning task , we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face - name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> and 20 controls .
To address the potential confounding effects of the <START:Chemical> cannabis <END> use of the <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> using group , a second analysis included 14 previously tested <START:Chemical> cannabis <END> users ( Nestor , L . , Roberts , G . , Garavan , H . , Hester , R . , 2008 .
<START:Disease> Deficits in learning and memory <END> : parahippocampal <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> and frontocortical hypoactivity in <START:Chemical> cannabis <END> users .
Neuroimage 40 , 1328 - 1339 ) .
<START:Chemical> Ecstasy <END> users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and <START:Chemical> cannabis <END> users .
A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> - specific <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> in bilateral frontal regions , left temporal , right parietal , bilateral temporal , and bilateral occipital brain regions .
<START:Chemical> Ecstasy <END> - specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex ( ACC ) and left posterior cingulated cortex .
In both <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> and <START:Chemical> cannabis <END> groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus , left parahippocampal gyrus , left dorsal cingulate gyrus , and left caudate .
These results elucidated <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> - related deficits , only some of which might be attributed to <START:Chemical> cannabis <END> use .
These <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> - specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin <END> synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in rats .
To investigate the relationship of <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> ( <START:Chemical> PGs <END> ) to <START:Disease> seizure <END> induction , the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on <START:Disease> convulsions <END> induced by <START:Chemical> flurothyl <END> , <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> , <START:Chemical> pentetrazol <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> ) , electroshock or <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> were evaluated .
<START:Chemical> Ibuprofen <END> , <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> , <START:Chemical> mefenamic acid <END> , and low dose <START:Chemical> meclofenamic acid <END> increased the latency - to - onset in the <START:Chemical> flurothyl <END> and / or <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> models ; the electroshock , <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> and <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> PGs <END> are involved in the mechanism ( s ) underlying <START:Chemical> fluorthyl <END> - and <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> , but not <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> - , electroshock - , or <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
<START:Chemical> Benzylacyclouridine <END> reverses <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> marrow suppression <END> without impairment of anti - human <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> virus activity .
Increased extracellular concentrations of <START:Chemical> uridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Urd <END> ) have been reported to reduce , in vitro , <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) - induced inhibition of human granulocyte - macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> virus ( HIV ) activity .
Because of the clinical <START:Disease> toxicities <END> associated with chronic <START:Chemical> Urd <END> administration , the ability of <START:Chemical> benzylacyclouridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> BAU <END> ) to effect , in vivo , <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> was assessed .
This agent inhibits <START:Chemical> Urd <END> catabolism and , in vivo , increases the plasma concentration of <START:Chemical> Urd <END> in a dose - dependent manner , without <START:Chemical> Urd <END> - related <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
In mice rendered <START:Disease> anemic <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenic <END> by the administration of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> for 28 days in drinking water ( 1 . 5 mg / mL ) , the continued administration of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> plus daily <START:Chemical> BAU <END> ( 300 mg / kg , orally ) partially reversed <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> ( P less than . 05 ) , increased peripheral reticulocytes ( to 4 . 9 % , P less than . 01 ) , increased cellularity in the marrow , and improved <START:Disease> megaloblastosis <END> .
When coadministered with <START:Chemical> AZT <END> from the onset of drug administration , <START:Chemical> BAU <END> reduced <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> marrow toxicity <END> .
In vitro , at a concentration of 100 mumol / L , <START:Chemical> BAU <END> possesses minimal anti - HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> to reverse the HIV - induced cytopathic effect in MT 4 cells .
The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed .
Force overflow and <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
We assessed force coordination of the hand in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> and its relationship to motor complications of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy , particularly to <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> LID <END> ) .
We studied two groups of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> patients with ( <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> , n = 23 ) and without <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> - <START:Disease> LID <END> , n = 10 ) , and age - matched healthy controls .
The motor score of the Unified <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s Disease <END> Rating Scale , a <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> score and force in a grip - lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> .
A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON - state in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> only .
In <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> , the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> ( by 61 % , P < 0 . 05 ) .
An overshooting of peak grip force by 51 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) and of static grip force by 45 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) was observed in the ON - compared with the OFF - drug condition .
In contrast , no excessive force was found in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> - <START:Disease> LID <END> .
Peak grip force in ON - state was 140 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) higher in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> than in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> - <START:Disease> LID <END> , while static grip force was increased by 138 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) between groups .
Severity of peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> was strongly correlated with grip force in ON - state ( r = 0 . 79 with peak force , P < 0 . 01 ) .
No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication .
Force excess was only observed in patients with <START:Disease> LID <END> and motor fluctuations .
A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in the ON - drug condition .
We postulate that both <START:Disease> LID <END> and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations .
Development of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> : comparison of adult male and female Wistar rats .
The development of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced ( 1 . 0 mg / kg s . c . once daily ) <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> of adult male and female Wistar rats obtained from the same breeder was studied in two consecutive sets .
In male animals , repeated <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> treatment induced a gradual development of <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> as evidenced by the increased intensity of <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> and shortened latency before the first attack toward the opponent .
In female rats , only a weak tendency toward <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> was found .
In conclusion , the present study demonstrates gender differences in the development of the <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> and indicates that the female rats do not fill the validation criteria for use in this method .
Role of <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
The current study dealt with the protective role of <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> , a <START:Chemical> polyphenol <END> from Mangifera indica Linn .
( Anacardiaceae ) , on <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> ( <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:Disease> MI <END> ) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism .
Subcutaneous injection of <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> ( 200 mg / kg body weight in 1 ml saline ) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> in rat heart , which was determined by the increased activity of serum <START:Chemical> lactate <END> dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and <START:Chemical> creatine <END> phosphokinase isoenzymes ( CK - MB ) , increased <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> level and reduced plasma <START:Chemical> iron <END> binding capacity .
The protective role of <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> was analyzed by <START:Chemical> triphenyl tetrazolium chloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> TTC <END> ) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the <START:Disease> ischemic myocardium <END> .
The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase , catalase , <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> peroxidase , <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> transferase and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> reductase activities , non - enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin , <START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> , <START:Chemical> Vitamin E <END> and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> levels were altered in <START:Disease> MI <END> rats .
Upon pretreatment with <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> ( 100 mg / kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of <START:Chemical> dimethyl sulphoxide <END> ) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to <START:Disease> MI <END> rats protected the above - mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels .
Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non - enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> administration as compared to <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> - induced <START:Disease> MI <END> rats .
From the present study it is concluded that <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> exerts a beneficial effect against <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> - induced <START:Disease> MI <END> due to its antioxidant potential , which regulated the tissues defense system against <START:Disease> cardiac damage <END> .
<START:Disease> REM sleep deprivation <END> changes behavioral response to catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation in rats .
The effects of <START:Disease> REM sleep deprivation <END> ( <START:Disease> REMD <END> ) on <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> and <START:Chemical> quipazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> head twitches <END> in rats were determined .
Forty - eight hr of <START:Disease> REMD <END> increased <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> , and reduced ( immediately after completing of <START:Disease> REMD <END> ) or increased ( 96 hr after completing of <START:Disease> REMD <END> ) <START:Chemical> quipazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> head twitches <END> .
Results are discussed in terms of similarity to pharmacological effects of other antidepressive treatments .
Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .
BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> , <START:Disease> osteoporosis <END> and <START:Disease> dementia <END> in older women .
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005 .
OBJECTIVES : To assess the effect of long - term HT on mortality , cardiovascular outcomes , <START:Disease> cancer <END> , <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> , cognition , <START:Disease> fractures <END> and quality of life .
SEARCH STRATEGY : We searched the following databases to November 2007 : Trials Register of the Cochrane <START:Disease> Menstrual Disorders <END> and Subfertility Group , Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials , MEDLINE , EMBASE , Biological Abstracts .
Also relevant non - indexed journals and conference abstracts .
SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .
HT included <START:Chemical> oestrogens <END> , with or without <START:Chemical> progestogens <END> , via oral , transdermal , subcutaneous or transnasal routes .
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data .
MAIN RESULTS : Nineteen trials involving 41 , 904 women were included .
In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> or coronary event ( after one year ' s use ) , <START:Disease> stroke <END> ( after three years ) , <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> and <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> .
Long - term <START:Chemical> oestrogen <END> - only HT significantly increased the risk of <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> , <START:Disease> stroke <END> and <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> ( after one to two years , three years and seven years ' use respectively ) , but did not significantly increase the risk of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of <START:Disease> fractures <END> and ( for combined HT ) <START:Disease> colon cancer <END> , with long - term use .
Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i . e . generally fit , without overt disease ) and taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of <START:Disease> dementia <END> .
Among women with <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> . One
trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking <START:Chemical> oestrogen <END> - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .
The only significantly increased risk reported was for <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> in women taking combined continuous HT : their absolute risk remained low , at less than 1 / 500 .
However , this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women .
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .
<START:Disease> Pseudoacromegaly <END> induced by the long - term use of <START:Chemical> minoxidil <END> .
<START:Disease> Acromegaly <END> is an <START:Disease> endocrine disorder <END> caused by chronic excessive growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland .
Significant disfiguring changes occur as a result of bone , cartilage , and soft tissue <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> , including the thickening of the skin , coarsening of facial features , and <START:Disease> cutis verticis gyrata <END> .
<START:Disease> Pseudoacromegaly <END> , on the other hand , is the presence of similar acromegaloid features in the absence of elevated growth hormone or insulin - like growth factor levels .
We present a patient with <START:Disease> pseudoacromegaly <END> that resulted from the long - term use of <START:Chemical> minoxidil <END> at an unusually high dose .
This is the first case report of <START:Disease> pseudoacromegaly <END> as a side effect of <START:Chemical> minoxidil <END> use .
A Phase II trial of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> plus <START:Chemical> WR - 2721 <END> ( <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> ) for metastatic <START:Disease> breast carcinoma <END> : an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study ( E 8188 ) .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Cisplatin <END> has minimal antitumor activity when used as second - or third - line treatment of metastatic <START:Disease> breast carcinoma <END> .
Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8 % when 60 - 120 mg / m 2 of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> is administered every 3 - 4 weeks .
Although a dose - response effect has been observed with <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , the dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicities <END> associated with <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( e . g . , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> , and <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> ) have limited its use as a treatment for <START:Disease> breast carcinoma <END> .
<START:Chemical> WR - 2721 <END> or <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war .
<START:Chemical> Amifostine <END> subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of <START:Chemical> alkylating agents <END> and <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy .
Early trials of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> and <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> also suggested that the incidence and severity of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> , and <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> were reduced .
METHODS : A Phase II study of the combination of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> plus <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic <START:Disease> breast carcinoma <END> who had received one , but not more than one , chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease .
Patients received <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> , 910 mg / m 2 intravenously over 15 minutes .
After completion of the <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> infusion , <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> 120 mg / m 2 was administered over 30 minutes .
Intravenous hydration and <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> was administered before and after <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> .
Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression .
RESULTS : Forty - four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 ( 16 % ) were ineligible .
A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients .
Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16 % .
Most patients ( 57 % ) stopped treatment because of disease progression .
<START:Disease> Neurologic toxicity <END> was reported in 52 % of patients .
Seven different life - threatening <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were observed in patients while receiving treatment .
CONCLUSIONS : The combination of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> and <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16 % .
Neither a <START:Disease> tumor <END> - protective effect nor reduced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> to normal tissues was observed with the addition of <START:Chemical> amifostine <END> to <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> in this trial .
A double - blind study of the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> dothiepin hydrochloride <END> in the treatment of major <START:Disease> depressive disorder <END> .
In a 6 - week double - blind parallel treatment study , <START:Chemical> dothiepin <END> and <START:Chemical> amitriptyline <END> were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 <START:Disease> depressed <END> outpatients .
<START:Chemical> Dothiepin <END> and <START:Chemical> amitriptyline <END> were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of <START:Disease> depressive illness <END> , and both were significantly superior to placebo .
The overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of <START:Disease> blurred vision <END> , <START:Disease> dry mouth <END> , and drowsiness were significantly less with <START:Chemical> dothiepin <END> than with <START:Chemical> amitriptyline <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dothiepin <END> also produced fewer CNS and cardiovascular effects .
There were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameters .
<START:Chemical> Dothiepin <END> thus was found to be an effective <START:Chemical> antidepressant <END> drug associated with fewer side effects than <START:Chemical> amitriptyline <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> depressed <END> outpatients .
<START:Disease> Liver disease <END> caused by <START:Chemical> propylthiouracil <END> .
This report presents the clinical , laboratory , and light and electron microscopic observations on a patient with <START:Disease> chronic active ( aggressive ) hepatitis <END> caused by the administration of <START:Chemical> propylthiouracil <END> .
This is an addition to the list of drugs that must be considered in the evaluation of chronic <START:Disease> liver disease <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxic <END> and possible leukemogenic effects of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> in nonhuman primates .
10 monkeys ( macaques ) received <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg / m 2 ( 1 mg / kg ) .
8 of the 10 monkeys developed <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> at an average cumulative <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> dose ( 310 mg / m 2 ) well below that considered the safe upper limit ( 550 mg / m 2 ) in man .
Histologically , the <START:Disease> myocardial lesions <END> resembled those found in human <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
1 of the 10 monkeys developed <START:Disease> acute myeloblastic leukemia <END> after receiving 324 mg / m 2 of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ; the 10 th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug .
Our results suggest that <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man , and that <START:Disease> leukemia <END> may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug .
Liposomal <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> in advanced <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> : a phase II study .
We report a non - randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> ( DaunoXome ) in the treatment of <START:Disease> AIDS <END> related <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> .
Eleven homosexual men with advanced <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> were entered in the trial .
Changes in size , colour and associated <START:Disease> oedema <END> of selected ' target ' lesions were measured .
Clinical , biochemical and haematological <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were assessed .
Ten subjects were evaluated .
A partial response was achieved in four , of whom two subsequently relapsed .
Stabilization of <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> occurred in the remaining six , maintained until the end of the trial period in four .
The drug was generally well tolerated , with few mild symptoms of <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The main problem encountered was haematological <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , with three subjects experiencing severe <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> ( neutrophil count < 0 . 5 x 10 ( 9 ) / l ) .
There was no evidence of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
In this small patient sample , liposomal <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ifosfamide <END> continuous infusion without <START:Chemical> mesna <END> .
A phase I trial of a 14 - day cycle .
Twenty patients received 27 courses of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> administered as a 24 - hour continuous infusion for 14 days without <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> .
The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> that would be comparable to standard bolus or short - term infusions administered with <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> .
Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300 , 400 , 450 , 500 , and 550 mg / m 2 / d .
Four patients developed transient microscopic <START:Disease> hematuria <END> at 400 , 450 , and 500 mg / m 2 / d .
There were no instances of macroscopic <START:Disease> hematuria <END> .
At 550 mg / m 2 / d , three patients experienced nonurologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ; <START:Disease> confusion <END> ( 1 ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( 1 ) , and Grade 2 <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> ( 1 ) .
The recommended dose of 500 mg / m 2 / d delivers a total dose of 7 g / m 2 per cycle , which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short - term infusion .
Because few patients received multiple courses over time , the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial .
The frequency and predictability of <START:Disease> hematuria <END> are not precise , and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential , adding <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> to the infusate in patients with persistent <START:Disease> hematuria <END> .
The protracted infusion schedule for <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> permits convenient outpatient administration without <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to 890 per cycle .
Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient , but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained .
<START:Chemical> Antituberculosis <END> therapy - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> : magnitude , profile , prognosis , and predictors of outcome .
<START:Chemical> Antituberculosis <END> therapy ( ATT ) - associated <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> ( ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> ) is the commonest drug - induced <START:Disease> ALF <END> in South Asia .
Prospective studies on ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> are lacking .
The current study prospectively evaluated the magnitude , clinical course , outcome , and prognostic factors in ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> .
From January 1986 to January 2009 , 1223 consecutive <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients were evaluated : ATT alone was the cause in 70 ( 5 . 7 % ) patients .
Another 15 ( 1 . 2 % ) had ATT and simultaneous <START:Disease> hepatitis virus infection <END> .
In 44 ( 62 . 8 % ) patients , ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> .
ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients were younger ( 32 . 87 [ + / - 15 . 8 ] years ) , and 49 ( 70 % ) of them were women .
Most had hyperacute presentation ; the median <START:Disease> icterus <END> <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> interval was 4 . 5 ( 0 - 30 ) days .
The median duration of ATT before <START:Disease> ALF <END> was 30 ( 7 - 350 ) days .
At presentation , advanced <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> and <START:Disease> cerebral edema <END> were present in 51 ( 76 % ) and 29 ( 41 . 4 % ) patients , respectively .
<START:Disease> Gastrointestinal bleed <END> , <START:Disease> seizures <END> , <START:Disease> infection <END> , and <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> were documented in seven ( 10 % ) , five ( 7 . 1 % ) , 26 ( 37 . 1 % ) , and seven ( 10 % ) patients , respectively .
Compared with <START:Disease> hepatitis E <END> virus ( HEV ) and non - A non - E - induced <START:Disease> ALF <END> , ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes .
The mortality rate among patients with ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> was high ( 67 . 1 % , n = 47 ) , and only 23 ( 32 . 9 % ) patients recovered with medical treatment .
In multivariate analysis , three factors independently predicted mortality : serum <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> ( > or = 10 . 8 mg / dL ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) prolongation ( > or = 26 seconds ) , and grade III / IV <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> at presentation .
CONCLUSION : ATT - <START:Disease> ALF <END> constituted 5 . 7 % of <START:Disease> ALF <END> at our center and had a high mortality rate .
Because the mortality rate is so high , determining which factors are predictors is less important .
A high proportion of patients had consumed ATT empirically , which could have been prevented .
Omitting <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> reduces <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , without increasing <START:Disease> pain <END> , after <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> for day surgery .
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> , <START:Disease> postoperative nausea and vomiting <END> occurs frequently .
<START:Chemical> Fentanyl <END> is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this , although it may also improve analgesia .
METHODS : This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of <START:Disease> postoperative nausea and vomiting <END> and <START:Disease> pain <END> in the first 24 h after <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients .
Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> , while a third group received <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> in addition to <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> .
RESULTS : Omission of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> did not reduce the overall incidence of <START:Disease> postoperative nausea and vomiting <END> , but did reduce the incidence of <START:Disease> vomiting <END> and / or moderate to severe <START:Disease> nausea <END> prior to discharge from 20 % and 17 % with <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> and <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> - <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> , respectively , to 5 % ( P = 0 . 013 ) .
Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24 % and 31 % to 7 % ( P = 0 . 0012 ) .
<START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of <START:Disease> postoperative nausea and vomiting <END> .
Combining the two <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids , reducing <START:Disease> postoperative nausea and vomiting <END> and <START:Disease> nausea <END> prior to discharge from 35 % and 33 % to 22 % and 19 % ( P = 0 . 049 and P = 0 . 035 ) , respectively , while <START:Disease> nausea <END> in the first 24 h was decreased from 42 % to 27 % ( P = 0 . 034 ) .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> .
<START:Chemical> Fentanyl <END> did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> - sparing effect and increased <START:Disease> respiratory depression <END> , <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
CONCLUSION : As <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> exacerbated <START:Disease> postoperative nausea and vomiting <END> without an improvement in <START:Disease> postoperative pain <END> and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects , it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> in day surgery .
<START:Chemical> Dextran <END> - <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> conjugates : synthesis , in vitro and in vivo evaluation .
<START:Chemical> Etodolac <END> ( <START:Chemical> E <END> ) , is a non - narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug .
A biodegradable polymer <START:Chemical> dextran <END> has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> - <START:Chemical> dextran <END> conjugates ( ED ) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects .
An activated moiety , i . e . <START:Chemical> N - acylimidazole <END> derivative of <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> ( <START:Chemical> EAI <END> ) , was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer <START:Chemical> dextran <END> of different molecular weights ( 40000 , 60000 , 110000 and 200000 ) .
IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates .
<START:Chemical> Etodolac <END> contents were evaluated by UV - spectrophotometric analysis .
The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark - Howink - Sakurada equation .
In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers ( pH 1 . 2 , 7 . 4 , 9 ) and in 80 % ( v / v ) human plasma ( pH 7 . 4 ) .
At pH 9 , a higher rate of <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7 . 4 and 80 % human plasma ( pH 7 . 4 ) , following first - order kinetics .
In vivo investigations were performed in animals .
Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using <START:Chemical> acetic acid <END> induced <START:Disease> writhing <END> model ( mice ) and <START:Chemical> carrageenan <END> - induced rat paw <START:Disease> edema <END> model , respectively .
In comparison to control , <START:Chemical> E <END> and ED 1 - ED 4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates ( ED 1 - ED 4 ) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug -- <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> .
Remission induction of <START:Disease> meningeal leukemia <END> with high - dose intravenous <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> .
Twenty children with <START:Disease> acute lymphoblastic leukemia <END> who developed <START:Disease> meningeal disease <END> were treated with a high - dose intravenous <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> regimen that was designed to achieve and maintain CSF <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> concentrations of 10 ( - 5 ) mol / L without the need for concomitant intrathecal dosing .
The <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> was administered as a loading dose of 6 , 000 mg / m 2 for a period of one hour followed by an infusion of 1 , 200 mg / m 2 / h for 23 hours .
<START:Chemical> Leucovorin <END> rescue was initiated 12 hours after the end of the infusion with a loading dose of 200 mg / m 2 followed by 12 mg / m 2 every three hours for six doses and then every six hours until the plasma <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> level decreased to less than 1 X 10 ( - 7 ) mol / L .
