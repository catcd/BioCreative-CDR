Effects of <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> on symptoms and postcibal small - bowel motor function in patients with <START:Disease> irritable bowel syndrome <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Irritable bowel syndrome <END> is a common cause of <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> and discomfort and may be related to <START:Disease> disordered gastrointestinal motility <END> .
Our aim was to assess the effects of long - term treatment with a prokinetic agent , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the <START:Disease> irritable bowel syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> IBS <END> ) .
METHODS : Thirty - eight patients with <START:Disease> IBS <END> ( <START:Disease> constipation <END> - predominant , n = 17 ; <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> - predominant , n = 21 ) underwent 24 - h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week ' s treatment [ <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , 5 mg three times daily ( n = 19 ) or placebo ( n = 19 ) ] .
RESULTS : In <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> - predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> and placebo groups .
In <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> - treated <START:Disease> diarrhoea <END> - predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher ( 29 . 3 + / - 3 . 2 versus 24 . 9 + / - 2 . 6 mm Hg , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 25 . 7 + / - 6 . 0 mm Hg ) , the mean contraction duration longer ( 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 versus 3 . 0 + / - 0 . 2 sec , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 3 . 1 + / - 0 . 5 sec ) , and the mean contraction frequency lower ( 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 2 versus 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 4 cont . / min , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 001 ) ; pretreatment , 2 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 cont . / min ] than patients treated with placebo .
No significant differences in jejunal motility were found in the <START:Disease> constipation <END> - predominant <START:Disease> IBS <END> group .
Symptoms were assessed by using a visual analogue scale before and after treatment .
Symptom scores relating to the severity of <START:Disease> constipation <END> were lower in <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> - treated <START:Disease> constipation <END> - predominant <START:Disease> IBS <END> patients [ score , 54 + / - 5 versus 67 + / - 14 mm , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; pretreatment , 62 + / - 19 mm ] .
<START:Disease> Diarrhoea <END> - predominant <START:Disease> IBS <END> patients had a higher <START:Disease> pain <END> score after <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> therapy [ score , 55 + / - 15 versus 34 + / - 12 mm , <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> versus placebo ( P < 0 . 05 ) ; pretreatment , 67 + / - 19 mm ] .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Cisapride <END> affects jejunal contraction characteristics and some symptoms in <START:Disease> IBS <END> .
The antiarrhythmic effect and possible ionic mechanisms of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> on animal models .
This study was designed to evaluate the effects of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> and explore the underlying ionic mechanism , using both <START:Chemical> aconitine <END> - induced rat and <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> - induced guinea pig <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> models .
Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular free - <START:Chemical> calcium <END> concentrations ( [ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) ] ( i )) in isolated myocytes .
The current data showed that <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> significantly delayed onset of <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> , decreased the time course of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation <END> , reduced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> score , and increased the survival time of <START:Disease> arrhythmic <END> rats and guinea pigs .
[ <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) ] ( i ) overload induced by <START:Chemical> aconitine <END> or <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> was reduced in isolated myocytes pretreated with <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
Moreover , M ( 3 ) - muscarinic <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor ( mAChR ) antagonist <START:Chemical> 4 - DAMP <END> ( <START:Chemical> 4 - diphenylacetoxy - N - methylpiperidine - methiodide <END> ) partially abolished the beneficial effects of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> produced antiarrhythmic actions on <START:Disease> arrhythmic <END> rat and guinea pig models induced by <START:Chemical> aconitine <END> or <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> via stimulating the cardiac M ( 3 ) - mAChR .
The mechanism may be related to the improvement of <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) handling .
<START:Chemical> Carboplatin <END> toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat .
BACKGROUND : The most striking of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> ' s advantages ( <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> ) over <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( <START:Chemical> CDDP <END> ) is its markedly reduced rate of <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> effects .
However , the use of <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> higher - intensity schedules and the association with other <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to <START:Disease> peripheral nervous system damage <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Two different schedules of <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i . p . twice a week for nine times ) were evaluated in Wistar rats .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxicity <END> was assessed for behavioral ( tail - flick test ) , neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve ) , morphological , morphometrical and analytical effects .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> administration induced dose - dependent <START:Disease> peripheral neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired , particularly after the high - dose treatment .
The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and , to a lesser extent , satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by <START:Chemical> CDDP <END> , mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons .
Moreover , significant amounts of <START:Chemical> platinum <END> were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> treatment .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> is <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> in our model , and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by <START:Chemical> CDDP <END> that it is probable that <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism .
This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of <START:Chemical> CBDCA <END> on the peripheral nervous system .
Dose - effect and structure - function relationships in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> CM <END> ) produced by the anticancer drug <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DXR <END> ) ( <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> ) provides a unique opportunity to analyze dose - effect and structure - function relationships during development of <START:Disease> myocardial disease <END> .
We measured the degree of morphologic damage by ultrastructural examination of endomyocardial biopsy and the degree of performance abnormally by right heart catheterization in patients receiving <START:Chemical> DXR <END> .
Morphologic damage was variable but was proportional to the total cumulative <START:Chemical> DXR <END> dose between 100 and 600 mg / m 2 .
Performance abnormalities correlated weakly with dose , exhibited a curvilinear relationship , and had a " threshold " for expression .
Catheterization abnormalities correlated well with morphologic damage ( r = 0 . 57 to 0 . 78 ) in a subgroup of patients in whom exercise hemodynamics were measured , and this relationship also exhibited a curvilinear , threshold configuration .
In <START:Chemical> DXR <END> - <START:Disease> CM <END> <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> is proportional to the degree of cytotoxic insult ( <START:Chemical> DXR <END> dose ) while myocardial function is preserved until a critical dose or degree of damage is reached , after which myocardial performance deteriorates rapidly .
<START:Disease> Amnestic syndrome <END> associated with <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> : a case report .
An elderly woman developed an <START:Disease> Alzheimer <END> - like subacute <START:Disease> dementia <END> as a result of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormalities .
There is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug <START:Disease> toxicity <END> can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain .
Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> volume in a mouse model of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - associated <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - associated <START:Disease> intracerebral hemorrhage <END> ( W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> ) is a severe type of <START:Disease> stroke <END> .
There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> .
Using a mouse model , we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human <START:Chemical> prothrombin complex concentrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PCC <END> ) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume .
Male CD - 1 mice were treated with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> ( 2 mg / kg over 24 h ) , resulting in a mean ( + / - s . d . ) International Normalized Ratio of 3 . 5 + / - 0 . 9 .
First , we showed that an intravenous administration of human <START:Chemical> PCC <END> rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice .
Second , a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> in the right striatum .
Forty - five minutes later , the animals were randomly treated with <START:Chemical> PCC <END> ( 100 U / kg ) or saline i . v . ( n = 12 per group ) .
Twenty - four hours after <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> induction , hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay .
The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in <START:Chemical> PCC <END> - treated animals ( 6 . 5 + / - 3 . 1 microL ) compared with saline controls ( 15 . 3 + / - 11 . 2 microL , P = 0 . 015 ) .
In the saline group , 45 % of the mice developed large <START:Disease> hematomas <END> ( i . e . , > 15 microL ) .
In contrast , such extensive lesions were never found in the <START:Chemical> PCC <END> group .
We provide experimental data suggesting <START:Chemical> PCC <END> to be an effective acute treatment for W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume .
Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W - <START:Disease> ICH <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced brainstem <START:Disease> seizures <END> and behavior .
A variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturbated subjects .
The abnormal behaviors were yawning , retrocollis , <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> , <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> , " beating drum " behavior , squealing , head bobbing , circling , sniffing , abnormal posturing , and facial twitching .
Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation .
These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates .
Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .
Metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
Metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> ( mGlu ) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) .
Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes , mGlu 7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia , but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of <START:Disease> PD <END> is not known .
The effects of <START:Chemical> N , N ' - dibenzhydrylethane - 1 , 2 - diamine dihydrochloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> ) , the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu 7 receptors , were thus tested in different rodent models of <START:Disease> PD <END> .
Here , we show that oral ( 5 mg / kg ) or intrastriatal administration ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 nmol ) of <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> reverses <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> ( 2 . 5 and 5 mg / kg ) reduces <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced rotations in unilateral <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> ) - lesioned rats .
In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major <START:Disease> akinetic <END> symptoms of <START:Disease> PD <END> patients , 5 mg / kg <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> - lesioned rats .
In addition , <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> reduces the duration of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in a mGlu 7 receptor - dependent manner in wild - type but not mGlu 7 receptor knockout mice .
Higher doses of <START:Chemical> AMN 082 <END> ( 10 and 20 mg / kg p . o . ) have no effect on the same models of <START:Disease> PD <END> .
Overall these findings suggest that mGlu 7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> activity .
Selective ligands of mGlu 7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies .
Delayed institution of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> during focal <START:Disease> cerebral ischemia <END> : effect on <START:Disease> brain edema <END> .
The effect of induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> instituted after a 2 - h delay following <START:Disease> middle cerebral artery occlusion <END> ( <START:Disease> MCAO <END> ) on <START:Disease> brain edema <END> formation and histochemical injury was studied .
Under <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> anesthesia , the MCA of 14 spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats was occluded .
In the control group ( n = 7 ) , the mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) was not manipulated .
In the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group ( n = 7 ) , the MAP was elevated by 25 - 30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after <START:Disease> MCAO <END> .
Four hours after <START:Disease> MCAO <END> , the rats were killed and the brains harvested .
The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> produced by <START:Disease> MCAO <END> .
Specific gravity ( SG ) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> territory ) .
The extent of <START:Disease> neuronal injury <END> was determined by <START:Chemical> 2 , 3 , 5 - triphenyltetrazolium <END> staining .
In the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> core , there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups .
In the periphery of the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> territory , SG in the cortex was greater ( less <START:Disease> edema <END> accumulation ) in the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group ( 1 . 041 + / - 0 . 001 vs 1 . 039 + / - 0 . 001 , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
The area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross - sectional area of the hemisphere ) was less in the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> group ( 33 + / - 3 % vs 21 + / - 2 % , P less than 0 . 05 ) .
The data indicate that <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> instituted 2 h after <START:Disease> MCAO <END> does not aggravate <START:Disease> edema <END> in the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> core , that it improves <START:Disease> edema <END> in the periphery of the <START:Disease> ischemic <END> territory , and that it reduces the area of histochemical <START:Disease> neuronal dysfunction <END> .
Contribution of the sympathetic nervous system to salt - sensitivity in lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - treated spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
OBJECTIVE : To test the hypothesis that , in lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - treated spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats ( SHR ) , the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> dietary sodium chloride <END> supplementation .
METHODS : Male SHR ( aged 6 weeks ) that had been treated from conception onward with either <START:Chemical> captopril <END> or vehicle remained on a basal <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet or were fed a high <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet .
After 2 weeks , the rats were subjected to ganglionic blockade and 2 days later , an infusion of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
RESULTS : Lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> treatment significantly lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups .
Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the <START:Chemical> dietary sodium chloride <END> - induced <START:Disease> increase in MAP <END> in both groups .
Infusion of the central nervous system <START:Chemical> alpha 2 - adrenergic receptor agonist <END> <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high ( compared with the basal ) <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet .
CONCLUSIONS : In both lifetime <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - treated and control SHR , the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high <START:Chemical> sodium chloride <END> diet .
Absolute and attributable risk of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> in women on combined <START:Chemical> cyproterone acetate <END> and <START:Chemical> ethinylestradiol <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To achieve absolute risk estimates of <START:Disease> venous thromboembolism <END> ( <START:Disease> VTE <END> ) among women on <START:Chemical> cyproterone acetate <END> plus <START:Chemical> ethinylestradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> ) , and among women on <START:Chemical> combined oral contraceptives <END> ( <START:Chemical> COCs <END> ) .
METHODS : From the Danish National Register of Patients ( NRP ) , 1996 to 1998 , the records of 1 . 1 million Danish women , ages 15 to 44 years , were searched for evidence of <START:Disease> VTE <END> .
<START:Chemical> COC <END> use was ascertained through mailed questionnaires .
Sales statistics of <START:Chemical> COCs <END> and <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> were provided through Danish Drug Statistics .
RESULTS : During the time frame of the study , 330 women were found to have had <START:Disease> VTE <END> while on <START:Chemical> COCs <END> .
Of these women , 67 were on <START:Chemical> levonorgestrel <END> - containing <START:Chemical> COCs <END> .
Eleven were on <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
The corresponding absolute risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> was 3 . 4 ( range , 3 . 1 - 3 . 8 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on <START:Chemical> COCs <END> , 4 . 2 ( range , 3 . 2 - 5 . 2 ) per 10 000 women years among women on <START:Chemical> levonorgestrel <END> - containing <START:Chemical> COCs <END> , and 3 . 1 ( range , 1 . 3 - 4 . 9 ) per 10 000 women years among the women on <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
CONCLUSION : Our results suggest the absolute risk of <START:Disease> VTE <END> among Danish women on <START:Chemical> COCs <END> is similar to that among women taking <START:Chemical> CPA <END> / <START:Chemical> EE <END> .
Urine N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase -- a marker of tubular damage ?
BACKGROUND : Although an indicator of <START:Disease> renal tubular dysfunction <END> , an increased urinary N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> Puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
Total protein , albumin , NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days .
The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty three .
RESULTS : Following intravenous <START:Chemical> PAN <END> urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four .
After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and NAG activity .
Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards .
Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four .
Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets ( day six onwards ) .
CONCLUSIONS : This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells .
Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .
The striatum as a target for anti - rigor effects of an antagonist of mGluR 1 , but not an agonist of group II metabotropic <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptors .
The aim of the present study was to find out whether the metabotropic receptor 1 ( mGluR 1 ) and group II mGluRs , localized in the striatum , are involved in antiparkinsonian - like effects in rats .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> ( 1 mg / kg ip ) induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> - like <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> , measured as an increased resistance of a rat ' s hind foot to passive flexion and extension at the ankle joint .
<START:Chemical> ( RS ) - 1 - aminoindan - 1 , 5 - dicarboxylic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> AIDA <END> ; 0 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a potent and selective mGluR 1 antagonist , or <START:Chemical> ( 2 R , 4 R ) - 4 - aminopyrrolidine - 2 , 4 - dicarboxylate <END> ( <START:Chemical> 2 R , 4 R - APDC <END> ; 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl ) , a selective group II agonist , was injected bilaterally into the striatum of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - treated animals .
<START:Chemical> AIDA <END> in doses of 7 . 5 - 15 microg / 0 . 5 microl diminished the <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> 2 R , 4 R - APDC <END> injections were ineffective .
The present results may suggest that the blockade of striatal mGluR 1 , but not the stimulation of group II mGluRs , may ameliorate <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
Lifetime treatment of mice with <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) produces <START:Disease> myelodysplasia <END> .
<START:Chemical> AZT <END> has induced a <START:Disease> macrocytic anemia <END> in <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patients on long term <START:Chemical> AZT <END> therapy .
It is generally assumed that DNA elongation is stopped by the insertion of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> into the chain in place of <START:Chemical> thymidine <END> thus preventing the <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differentiation .
CBA / Ca male mice started on <START:Chemical> AZT <END> 0 . 75 mg / ml H 2 O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0 . 5 mg / ml H 2 O for a group , another group removed from <START:Chemical> AZT <END> to see recovery , and third group remained on 0 . 75 mg . At 687 days mice that had been on 0 . 75 mg had average platelet counts of 2 . 5 x 10 ( 6 ) .
Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> showed changes compatible with <START:Disease> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> MDS <END> ) .
A variety of histological patterns was observed .
There were two cases of hypocellular <START:Disease> myelodysplasia <END> , two cases of hypersegmented <START:Disease> myelodysplastic <END> granulocytosis , two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei , one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a <START:Disease> hyperplastic marrow <END> , <START:Disease> dysmyelopoiesis <END> and a <START:Disease> hypocellular marrow <END> and two cases of <START:Disease> myelodysplasia <END> with <START:Disease> dyserythropoiesis <END> , <START:Disease> hemosiderosis <END> and a <START:Disease> hypocellular marrow <END> .
Above mentioned <START:Chemical> AZT <END> incorporation may have induced an ineffective hemopoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells , which is known to be seen commonly in the <START:Disease> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> .
The activation of spinal <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial <START:Chemical> morphine <END> after a noninjurious interval of <START:Disease> spinal cord ischemia <END> .
We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of <START:Chemical> N - methyl - d - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptors after neuraxial <START:Chemical> morphine <END> following a noninjurious interval of <START:Disease> aortic occlusion <END> in rats .
<START:Disease> Spinal cord ischemia <END> was induced by <START:Disease> aortic occlusion <END> for 6 min with a balloon catheter .
In a microdialysis study , 10 muL of saline ( group C ; n = 8 ) or 30 mug of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( group M ; n = 8 ) was injected intrathecally ( IT ) 0 . 5 h after reflow , and 30 mug of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( group SM ; n = 8 ) or 10 muL of saline ( group SC ; n = 8 ) was injected IT 0 . 5 h after sham operation .
Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia , before IT injection , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , and 48 h of reperfusion ( after IT injection ) .
Second , we investigated the effect of IT <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 30 mug ) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> spastic paraparesis <END> .
After IT <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
This increase persisted for 8 hrs .
IT <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> significantly reduced the number of dark - stained alpha - motoneurons after <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> spastic paraparesis <END> compared with the saline group .
These data indicate that IT <START:Chemical> morphine <END> induces <START:Disease> spastic paraparesis <END> with a concomitant increase in CSF <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> , which is involved in <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor activation .
We suggest that opioids may be <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> in the setting of <START:Disease> spinal cord ischemia <END> via <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor activation .
Adequate timing of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> reduction in patients with <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> during combination therapy of <START:Chemical> interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> for <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hemolytic anemia <END> is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of <START:Chemical> interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
Because of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - related <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , dose reduction is a common event in this therapy .
In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> reduction in patients with <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> during combination therapy .
METHODS : Thirty - seven of 160 patients who had HCV - genotype 1 b , had high virus load , and received 24 - week combination therapy developed <START:Disease> anemia <END> with hemoglobin level < 10 g / dl or <START:Disease> anemia <END> - related signs during therapy .
After that , these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> ( 200 mg ) per day .
After reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group A ) .
However , 10 of 37 patients with reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> could not continue combination therapy because their < 8 . 5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or <START:Disease> anemia <END> - related severe side effects occurred ( group B ) .
We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> in groups A and B .
RESULTS : A sustained virological response ( SVR ) was 29 . 6 % ( 8 / 27 ) in group A and 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B , respectively .
A 34 . 4 % ( 12 / 27 ) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group B ( P = 0 . 051 ) , with slight significance .
With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> reduction , a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or = 10 g / dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with < 10 g / dl ( P = 0 . 036 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Reduction of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> at hemoglobin level > or = 10 g / dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> subsequent to the administration of <START:Chemical> rifampicin <END> .
A follow - up study of cases reported earlier .
A clinical presentation is made of a 2 - 3 year follow - up of six cases of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> that have been reported earlier .
The patients had developed transient <START:Disease> renal failure <END> after the intermittent administration of <START:Chemical> rifampicin <END> .
The stage of olig - <START:Disease> anuria <END> lasted for 1 - 3 weeks , and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis .
Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow - up period .
The four patients re - examined were clinically cured .
Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce .
Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied .
Renal function was normal .
In three cases the excretion at 131 I - hippuran renography was slightly slowed .
Although in the acute stage the <START:Disease> renal lesions <END> histologically appeared toxic , evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> immune reaction as a mechanism for <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - associated <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To assess lymphocyte reactivity to <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> and to serum containing putative ex vivo <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> antigens or metabolites in a case of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> .
PATIENT : A 58 - year - old woman with a clinical diagnosis of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> .
METHODS : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> intake .
A similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subject .
RESULTS : No lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> solutions .
A significant proliferative response to serum collected after <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug intake .
No reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar conditions .
CONCLUSIONS : The methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo - prepared <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> antigens , suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in <START:Chemical> dilevalol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> .
Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - associated <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> .
INTRODUCTION : <START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> use has been associated with <START:Disease> neurovascular complications <END> , including arterial vasoconstriction and <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> .
However , there are few studies of angiographic effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> on human cerebral arteries .
Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - associated <START:Disease> subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> SAH <END> ) who underwent angiography shortly after <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
METHODS : We screened patients with <START:Disease> SAH <END> retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or its metabolites .
Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with <START:Disease> SAH <END> who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter .
Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made .
RESULTS : Thirteen patients with positive <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> toxicology were compared to 26 controls .
There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid , sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral , precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral , or basilar arteries ( p greater than 0 . 05 for all comparisons , unpaired t - tests ) .
There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery ( p greater than 0 . 05 , unpaired t - tests ) .
Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group .
CONCLUSION : No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> could be found in patients who underwent angiography after <START:Disease> aneurysmal <END> <START:Disease> SAH <END> associated with <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use .
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during <START:Chemical> fluorouracil <END> therapy : a prospective study .
Although there have been anecdotal reports of <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) therapy , this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion .
We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion for treatment of solid <START:Disease> tumors <END> in order to assess the incidence of <START:Disease> ischemic <END> ST changes .
Patients were monitored for 23 + / - 4 hours before <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion , and 98 + / - 9 hours during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion .
<START:Disease> Anginal <END> episodes were rare : only one patient had <START:Disease> angina <END> ( during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion ) .
However , asymptomatic ST changes ( greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation ) were common : six of 25 patients ( 24 % ) had ST changes before <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion v 17 ( 68 % ) during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion ( P less than . 002 ) .
The incidence of <START:Disease> ischemic <END> episodes per patient per hour was 0 . 05 + / - 0 . 02 prior to <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion v 0 . 13 + / - 0 . 03 during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion ( P less than . 001 ) ; the duration of ECG changes was 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 3 minutes per patient per hour before <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> v 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 5 minutes per patient per hour during <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ( P less than . 01 ) .
ECG changes were more common among patients with known <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
There were two cases of <START:Disease> sudden death <END> , both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , particularly among patients with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> reversal of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> due to <START:Chemical> captopril <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The hemodynamic effects of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> and other <START:Chemical> angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors <END> may be mediated by the endogenous opioid system .
The opioid antagonist <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> has been shown to block or reverse the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> actions of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> .
We report a case of an intentional <START:Chemical> captopril <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , manifested by marked <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , that resolved promptly with the administration of <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
To our knowledge , this is the first reported case of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> treated with <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
Our experience demonstrates a possible role of <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> in the reversal of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> resulting from <START:Chemical> captopril <END> .
Enhanced stimulus - induced neurotransmitter overflow in <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor activation .
The present study examines the effect of 6 - day <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment ( 100 micrograms / kg per h , s . c . ) on stimulus - induced ( 1 Hz ) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle - and <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - treated rats .
Renal <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> stores and stimulus - induced overflow in the vehicle - treated group consisted of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> only .
However , <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment resulted in the incorporation of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> into renal <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> stores such that approximately 40 % of the <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> present was <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> while the <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> content was reduced by a similar degree .
Total tissue <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged .
Stimulus - induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> and <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> in proportions similar to those found in the kidney .
This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade .
<START:Chemical> Propranolol <END> had no effect on stimulus - induced overflow in either group .
<START:Chemical> Phentolamine <END> increased stimulus - induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - treated group .
In conclusion , chronic <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow .
However , neither alterations in prejunctional beta - adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration .
Furthermore , data obtained with <START:Chemical> phentolamine <END> alone do not suggest alpha - adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> treatment .
<START:Chemical> Amphotericin B <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> AIDS <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of multiple episodes of <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity in an <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patent following <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> infusion .
CASE SUMMARY : A 46 - year - old African - American man experienced recurrent <START:Disease> grand mal seizures <END> during intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> , then petit mal <START:Disease> seizures <END> as the infusion was stopped and the drug concentrations decreased with time .
The patients concurrent medications included <START:Chemical> didanosine <END> , <START:Chemical> hydroxyzine <END> , <START:Chemical> promethazine <END> , <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> , and <START:Chemical> prochlorperazine <END> .
Despite administration of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> and <START:Chemical> lorazepam <END> , the <START:Disease> seizures <END> persisted and occurred only during <START:Chemical> amphotercin B <END> administration .
DISCUSSION : <START:Disease> AIDS <END> and <START:Disease> cryptococcal meningitis <END> , both of which the patient had , can potentially cause <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The patient had a history of <START:Disease> alcohol abuse <END> ; <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> intake as well as withdrawal can also cause <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
<START:Chemical> Didanosine <END> also has a potential for inducing <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
However , these other potential causes of <START:Disease> seizure <END> were ruled out .
The time course of events suggested that <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> was the cause of the <START:Disease> seizures <END> in this <START:Disease> AIDS <END> patient .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Amphotericin B <END> seems to be the probable cause of the <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
To date , only three cases of <START:Disease> seizures <END> associated with <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> have been reported in the literature , but healthcare providers should be aware of the potential for this rare adverse effect .
Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> virus - related <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> monotherapy .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection <END> , which causes <START:Disease> liver cirrhosis <END> and <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> , remains a major health problem in Asian countries .
Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers , although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now .
In this report , we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV - related <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy .
The patient was a 50 - year - old woman .
Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient , thus this patient had been referred to our hospital .
However , the administration of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> , a reverse transcriptase inhibitor , for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity .
During this period , no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged , and the serum HBV - DNA level was continuously suppressed .
These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued .
Moreover , both <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen <END> were observed to have disappeared in this patient .
The administration of <START:Chemical> lamivudine <END> to patients with HBV - related <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> , like our present case , should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option , especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available .
Microinjection of <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> into the CA 1 region of hippocampus improves <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> in adult male rats .
The effect of <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> ( 5 - HT 2 antagonist ) on <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( muscarinic cholinergic antagonist ) - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> in Morris water maze ( MWM ) was investigated .
Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA 1 region of the hippocampus .
One week later , they received repeatedly vehicles ( saline , <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> , saline + <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> ) , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl saline / side ; 30 min before training ) , <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> ( 2 , 4 and 8 microg / 0 . 5 microl <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> / side ; 20 min before training ) and <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 2 microg / 0 . 5 microl ; 30 min before <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> injection ) + <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> ) through cannulae each day .
Animals were tested for four consecutive days ( 4 trial / day ) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged .
In the fifth day , the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor , motivational and visual systems .
The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - treated group as compared to saline group .
<START:Chemical> Ritanserin <END> - treated rats ( 4 microg / 0 . 5 microl / side ) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to <START:Chemical> DMSO <END> - treated group .
However , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> and <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> co - administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - treated rats .
Our findings show that microinjection of <START:Chemical> ritanserin <END> into the CA 1 region of the hippocampus improves the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation .
To quantify the effects of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> , <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation , these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally ( 30 mg / kg / day ) for 7 , 14 or 21 days .
Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia , urinary measurements of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> , <START:Chemical> potassium <END> , endogenous lysozyme , N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase ( NAG ) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i . v . administration of egg - white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance ( GFR ) were done in each treatment group .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin <END> administration decreased diameter , density and shape of endothelial fenestrae .
<START:Chemical> Kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> appeared to have no effect at the dose used .
All three <START:Chemical> aminoglycosides <END> decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> .
While <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> and <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i . v . administration of egg - white lysozyme <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> had no effect .
Daily excretion of total protein , endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with <START:Chemical> kanamycin <END> and <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> .
Thus , <START:Chemical> aminoglycosides <END> may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and / or tubular level inducing <START:Disease> impairment of renal reabsorption <END> and accumulation of proteins .
Immunopathology of <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> glomerular disease <END> .
Four patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> developed heavy <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> after five to 12 months of treatment with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> .
Light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase , or no departure from normal .
Electron microscopy , however , revealed subepithelial electron - dense deposits , fusion of epithelial cell foot processes , and evidence of mesangial cell hyperactivity .
Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of IgG and C 3 .
The findings were similar to those in early <START:Disease> membranous glomerulonephritis <END> , differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early - acting complement components C 1 q and C 4 .
It is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway .
Effect of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> on the <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> evoked by <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration .
OBJECTIVE : In this study the effect of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> on the <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> was evaluated in nine female patients with <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia <END> .
METHOD : <START:Disease> Sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> was induced by <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> administration ( 0 . 5 mg <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> intramuscularly and 10 mg <START:Chemical> morphine <END> subcutaneously ) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy .
The entire procedure was repeated during <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> infusion ( <START:Chemical> Nitrolingual <END> 1 microg / kg / min for 120 min ) .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity ( Tmax ) over the hepatic hilum ( HH : 34 . 33 + / - 5 . 05 vs . 22 . 77 + / - 3 . 26 ) and the common bile duct ( CBD : 60 . 44 + / - 5 . 99 vs . 40 . 0 + / - 2 . 88 ) and in the half - time of excretion ( T 1 / 2 ) over the liver parenchyma ( LP : 120 . 04 + / - 16 . 01 vs . 27 . 37 + / - 2 . 19 ) , HH ( 117 . 61 + / - 14 . 71 vs . 31 . 85 + / - 3 . 99 ) and CBD ( 158 . 11 + / - 9 . 18 vs . 40 . 1 + / - 6 . 24 ) , indicating a complete <START:Disease> spasm <END> at the level of the sphincter of Oddi .
<START:Chemical> Glyceryl trinitrate <END> infusion completely normalized the <START:Chemical> prostigmine <END> - <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced alterations in these quantitative parameters ( TmaX over the LP : 11 . 33 + / - 1 . 13 ; over the HH : 18 . 88 + / - 1 . 48 ; and over the CBD : 36 . 22 + / - 1 . 92 ; and T 1 / 2 over the LP : 28 . 21 + / - 1 . 83 ; over the HH : 33 . 42 + / - 3 . 10 ; and over the CBD : 41 . 66 + / - 6 . 33 ) , suggesting an effective sphincter - relaxing effect of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> .
CONCLUSION : These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> on the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi spasm <END> in humans .
Since <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> is able to overcome even the drastic effect of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , it might be of relevance in the treatment of <START:Disease> sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> - associated <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> .
INTRODUCTION : <START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> is used in the treatment of <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> , which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia , and can be associated with permanent <START:Disease> visual loss <END> .
We report 3 cases which presented with <START:Disease> bitemporal hemianopia <END> .
CLINICAL PICTURE : Three patients with <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> - associated toxic <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> are described .
All 3 patients had <START:Disease> loss of central visual acuity , colour vision ( Ishihara ) and visual field <END> .
The <START:Disease> visual field loss <END> had a bitemporal flavour , suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm .
TREATMENT : Despite stopping <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> on diagnosis , visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months .
Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases .
In the third case , visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale .
OUTCOME : All 3 patients had some permanent <START:Disease> loss of visual function <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> usage is associated with permanent <START:Disease> visual loss <END> and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow - up .
The author postulates that in cases of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> associated chiasmopathy , <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm .
<START:Disease> Myocardial ischemia <END> due to <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> during <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress echocardiography .
<START:Chemical> Dobutamine <END> stress echocardiography ( DSE ) is a useful and safe provocation test for <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
Until now , the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery , and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed <START:Disease> coronary artery stenosis <END> .
The aim of the present study is to examine whether <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> due to <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> is induced by <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> .
We performed DSE on 51 patients with <START:Disease> coronary spastic angina <END> but without significant fixed <START:Disease> coronary artery stenosis <END> .
All patients had <START:Disease> anginal <END> attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ( <START:Disease> variant angina <END> ) .
Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> , and no fixed <START:Disease> coronary artery stenosis <END> was documented on angiograms in all patients .
DSE was performed with intravenous <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion with an incremental doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 minutes .
Of the 51 patients , 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation .
All 7 patients ( 13 . 7 % ) had <START:Disease> chest pain <END> during asynergy , and both <START:Disease> chest pain <END> and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy .
These findings indicate that <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> can provoke <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> in some patients with <START:Disease> coronary spastic angina <END> .
When DSE is performed to evaluate <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , not only fixed <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> , but also <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> should be considered as a genesis of asynergy .
Assessment of the onset and persistence of <START:Disease> amnesia <END> during procedural sedation with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To assess patients ' ability to repeat and recall words presented to them while undergoing procedural sedation with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> , and correlate their recall with their level of awareness as measured by bispectral index ( BIS ) monitoring .
METHODS : This was a prospective , single - intervention study of consenting adult patients undergoing procedural sedation with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> between December 28 , 2002 , and October 31 , 2003 .
BIS monitoring was initiated starting 3 minutes before the procedure and continuing until the patient had regained baseline mental status .
At 1 - minute intervals during the procedural sedation , until the patient regained baseline mental status at the end of the procedure , a word from a standardized list was read aloud , and the patient was asked to immediately repeat the word to the investigator .
The BIS score at the time the word was read and the patient ' s ability to repeat the word were recorded .
After the procedure , the patient was asked to state all of the words from the list that he or she could recall , and to identify the last word recalled from prior to the start of the procedure and the first word recalled from after the procedure was completed .
RESULTS : Seventy - five consenting patients were enrolled ; one patient was excluded from data analysis for a protocol violation .
No serious adverse events were noted during the procedural sedations .
The mean ( + / - standard deviation ) time of data collection was 16 . 4 minutes ( + / - 7 . 1 ; range 5 to 34 minutes ) .
The mean initial ( preprocedure ) BIS score was 97 . 1 ( + / - 2 . 3 ; range 92 to 99 ) .
The mean lowest BIS score occurring during these procedural sedations was 66 . 9 ( + / - 14 . 4 ; range 33 to 91 ) .
The mean lowest BIS score corresponding to the ability of the patient to immediately repeat words read from the list was 77 . 1 ( 95 % CI = 74 . 3 to 80 . 0 ) .
The mean highest BIS score corresponding to the <START:Disease> inability to repeat words <END> was 81 . 5 ( 95 % CI = 78 . 1 to 84 . 8 ) .
The mean BIS score corresponding to the last word recalled from prior to the initiation of the sedation was 96 . 7 ( + / - 2 . 4 ; range 84 to 98 ) .
The mean BIS score corresponding to the first word recalled after the procedure was completed was 91 . 2 ( 95 % CI = 88 . 1 to 94 . 3 ) .
All patients recalled at least one word that had been read to them during the protocol .
The mean lowest BIS score for any recalled word was 91 . 5 ( + / - 11 . 1 ; range 79 to 98 ) , and no words were recalled when the corresponding BIS score was less than 90 .
CONCLUSIONS : There is a range of BIS scores during which sedated patients are able to repeat words read to them but are not able to subsequently recall these words .
Furthermore , patients had no recall of words repeated prior to procedural sedation in BIS ranges associated with recall after procedural sedation , suggestive of <START:Disease> retrograde amnesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Vasopressin <END> in the treatment of <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in severe <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> in the treatment of severe <START:Disease> heart failure <END> is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
In patients with decompensated <START:Disease> heart failure <END> with <START:Disease> hypotension <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> , low doses of <START:Chemical> vasopressin <END> restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of <START:Chemical> milrinone <END> .
Transient <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> following unilateral <START:Disease> substantia nigra lesion <END> reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
Following unilateral <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> induced <START:Disease> SN lesion <END> , a transient period of <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> has been reported to precede the predominant <START:Disease> ipsilateral circling <END> .
In order to clarify the nature of this initial <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> rotational behavior <END> .
Three days post lesion , most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion .
Such <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> may result from either degeneration - induced breakdown of the DA pool , or lesion - induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons .
A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> .
However , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> dose , or post - lesion motor exercise ) , <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> rotation <END> tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> injections .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> has an irreversible effect on the post - lesion DA pool contributing to <START:Disease> contralateral rotation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Clarithromycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Clarithromycin <END> is a relatively new <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antibiotic that offers twice - daily dosing .
It differs from <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6 .
Although the side - effect profile of <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> is established , including <START:Disease> gastroenteritis <END> and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed - function oxidase metabolism , experience with the newer <START:Chemical> macrolides <END> is still being recorded .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxicity <END> has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> but has never been reported with the newer <START:Chemical> macrolides <END> .
We report a case of <START:Disease> ventricular dysrhythmias <END> that occurred after six therapeutic doses of <START:Chemical> clarithromycin <END> .
The <START:Disease> dysrhythmias <END> resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
Auditory disturbance associated with interscalene brachial plexus block .
We performed an audiometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an interscalene brachial plexus block ( IBPB ) .
<START:Chemical> Bupivacaine <END> 0 . 75 % with <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> was given followed by a 24 - hr continuous infusion of 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
Three audiometric threshold measurements ( 0 . 25 - 18 kHz ) were made : the first before IBPB , the second 2 - 6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation .
In four patients <START:Disease> hearing impairment <END> on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation , in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day .
The frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients ; in one only low frequencies ( 0 . 25 - 0 . 5 kHz ) were involved .
The maximum change in threshold was 35 dB at 6 kHz measured at the end of the continuous infusion of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
This patient had hearing threshold changes ( 15 - 20 dB ) at 6 - 10 kHz on the opposite side also .
IBPB may cause transient <START:Disease> auditory dysfunction <END> in the ipsilateral ear , possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbital <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> in a <START:Disease> neurologically - impaired <END> child .
A 2 - year - old child with known <START:Disease> neurologic impairment <END> developed a <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> soon after starting <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> therapy for <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Known causes of <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> were eliminated after evaluation .
On repeat challenge with <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> , the <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> recurred .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbital <END> should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor <START:Chemical> N 10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , <START:Chemical> N 10 - propargyl - 5 , 8 - dideazafolic acid <END> , is a tight - binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) whose <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme .
Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> polyglutamates .
Following a 12 - hour exposure of L 1210 cells to 50 microM [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , 30 % of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> tetra - and pentaglutamate , as determined by high - pressure liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) analyses .
As inhibitors of isolated L 1210 TS , CB 3717 di - , tri - , tetra - and pentaglutamate are 26 - , 87 - , 119 - and 114 - fold more potent than <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , respectively , and their formation may , therefore , be an important determinant of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> .
In early clinical studies with <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> , activity has been seen in <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> , <START:Disease> hepatoma <END> , and <START:Disease> mesothelioma <END> .
<START:Disease> Toxicities <END> included <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , <START:Disease> malaise <END> , and dose - limiting <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> under acidic conditions .
In an attempt to overcome this problem , a clinical trial of <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> administered with alkaline diuresis is under way .
Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg / m 2 suggest that a reduction in <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> may have been achieved with only 1 instance of <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> in 10 patients .
<START:Disease> Hepatotoxicity <END> and <START:Disease> malaise <END> are again the most frequent side effects .
Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients .
Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter <START:Chemical> CB 3717 <END> plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved .
Reduced <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel density , altered voltage dependence of inactivation , and increased susceptibility to <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice lacking <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel beta 2 - subunits .
<START:Chemical> Sodium <END> channel beta - subunits modulate channel gating , assembly , and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems .
We generated beta 2 ( - / - ) mice to investigate the role of beta 2 in control of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel density , localization , and function in neurons in vivo .
Measurements of [ ( 3 ) H ] <START:Chemical> saxitoxin <END> ( <START:Chemical> STX <END> ) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channels in beta 2 ( - / - ) neurons .
The loss of beta 2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in <START:Chemical> sodium <END> current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons .
The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced , and the threshold for action potential generation was increased , indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channels .
In contrast , the conduction velocity , the number and size of axons in the optic nerve , and the specific localization of <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( v ) 1 . 6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged .
beta 2 ( - / - ) mice displayed increased susceptibility to <START:Disease> seizures <END> , as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , but seemed normal in other neurological tests .
Our observations show that beta 2 - subunits play an important role in the regulation of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability .
Influence of diet free of <START:Chemical> NAD <END> - precursors on <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in mice .
Recently , we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of <START:Chemical> nicotinic acid amide <END> , a selective inhibitor of <START:Chemical> poly ( ADP - ribose ) <END> polymerase ( PARP ; EC 2 . 4 . 2 . 30 ) on mice suffering from <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ( <START:Chemical> AAP <END> ) - <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> , suggesting that the <START:Chemical> AAP <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> involves a step which depends on adenoribosylation .
The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of <START:Chemical> NAD <END> , the substrate on which PARP acts , in female NMRI mice with <START:Chemical> AAP <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> and evaluates the influence of simultaneous <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> consumption in these animals .
<START:Disease> Liver injuries <END> were quantified as serum activities of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> - <START:Chemical> oxaloacetate <END> transaminase ( GOT ) and <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> - <START:Chemical> pyruvate <END> transaminase ( GPT ) .
While <START:Chemical> AAP <END> caused a 117 - fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet , which was significantly exacerbated by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> and inhibited by <START:Chemical> nicotinic acid amide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NAA <END> ) , adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of <START:Chemical> NAD <END> .
In these animals , only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of <START:Chemical> AAP <END> , and unlike the exacerbation caused by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> in mice on a standard diet , the <START:Disease> liver damage <END> was inhibited by 50 % by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> .
A further 64 % reduction of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> was observed , when <START:Chemical> NAA <END> was given to <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> / <START:Chemical> AAP <END> - mice .
Our results provide evidence that the <START:Chemical> AAP <END> - induced <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> and its exacerbation by <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> can either be reduced by end - product inhibition of PARP by <START:Chemical> NAA <END> or by dietary depletion of the enzyme ' s substrate <START:Chemical> NAD <END> .
We see the main application of <START:Chemical> NAA <END> as for the combinational use in pharmaceutical preparations of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> in order to avoid <START:Disease> hepatic damage <END> in patients treated with this widely used analgesic .
Reversal of neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> by novel <START:Chemical> aryl - piperazine <END> anxiolytic drugs .
The novel anxiolytic drug , <START:Chemical> buspirone <END> , reverses <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
A series of <START:Chemical> aryl - piperazine <END> analogues of <START:Chemical> buspirone <END> and other <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptaminergic agonists <END> were tested for their ability to reverse <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
Those drugs with strong affinity for <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamine <END> 1 a receptors were able to reverse <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
Drugs with affinity for other <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> receptors or weak affinity were ineffective .
However , inhibition of postsynaptic <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> in freely - moving conscious rats : behavioral approach to a new model of <START:Disease> visceral pain <END> .
PURPOSE : To develop a model of <START:Disease> visceral pain <END> in rats using a behavioral approach .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CP <END> ) , an antitumoral agent known to produce toxic effects on the bladder wall through its main toxic metabolite <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> , was used to induce <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : <START:Chemical> CP <END> was administered at doses of 50 , 100 and 200 mg . / kg . i . p . to male rats , and their behavior observed and scored .
The effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( 0 . 5 to 4 mg . / kg . i . v . ) on <START:Chemical> CP <END> - induced behavioral modifications were tested administered alone and after <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> ( 1 mg . / kg . s . c . ) .
In addition , 90 minutes after <START:Chemical> CP <END> injection , that is , at the time of administration of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , the bladder was removed in some rats for histological examination .
Finally , to show that the bladder is essential for the <START:Chemical> CP <END> - induced behavioral modifications , female rats also received <START:Chemical> CP <END> at doses of 200 mg . / kg . i . p . and of 20 mg . by the intravesical route , and <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> at doses of 0 . 5 mg . by the intravesical route and of 5 mg . / kg . i . v . RESULTS : <START:Chemical> CP <END> dose - relatedly induced marked behavioral modifications in male rats : breathing rate decrease , closing of the eyes and occurrence of specific postures .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> dose - dependently reversed these <START:Disease> behavioral disorders <END> .
A dose of 0 . 5 mg . / kg . produced a reduction of almost 50 % of the behavioral score induced by <START:Chemical> CP <END> 200 mg . / kg .
This effect was completely prevented by pretreatment with <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
At the time of administration of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , histological modifications of the bladder wall , such as chorionic and muscle layer <START:Disease> edema <END> , were observed .
In female rats , <START:Chemical> CP <END> 200 mg . / kg . i . p . produced the same marked behavioral modifications as those observed in male rats .
Administered at the dose of 20 mg . intravesically , <START:Chemical> CP <END> did not produce any behavioral effects , whereas <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> at 0 . 5 mg . intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under <START:Chemical> CP <END> 200 mg . / kg . i . p . , with the same maximal levels .
Conversely , <START:Chemical> acrolein <END> 5 mg . / kg . i . v . did not produce any behavioral effects at all .
CONCLUSIONS : Overall , these results indicate that this experimental model of <START:Chemical> CP <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory <START:Disease> visceral pain <END> , allowing a better understanding of these <START:Disease> painful syndromes <END> and thus a better therapeutic approach to them .
Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> with <START:Chemical> iodine - 125 - metaiodobenzylguanidine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> ) , an analog of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ( <START:Chemical> NE <END> ) , serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function .
Using a rat model of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose - dependently in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
The degree of <START:Disease> vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells <END> was analyzed in relation to the duration of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> treatment ( 2 mg / kg , once a week ) .
There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1 - or 2 - wk treatment groups , isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3 - wk group , frequent scattered degeneration in the 4 - wk group , scattered or focal degeneration in the 5 - wk group , and extensive degeneration in the 8 - wk group .
Myocardial accumulation of [ 125 I ] <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less .
However , the 4 - wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall ( 82 % of the control ) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0 . 05 ) .
In the 5 - wk group , <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35 % and 27 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
In the 8 - wk group , <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18 % and 14 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0 . 001 ) .
Thus , <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> dose - dependent manner .
The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight <START:Disease> myocardial impairment <END> ( scattered or focal <START:Disease> vacuolar degeneration <END> ) indicates that <START:Chemical> MIBG <END> scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
<START:Disease> St . Anthony ' s fire <END> , then and now : a case report and historical review .
A rare case of morbid <START:Disease> vasospasm <END> , together with striking angiographic findings , is described secondary to the ingestion of <START:Chemical> methysergide <END> by a 48 - year - old woman .
A brief review of the literature on similar cases is presented .
A discussion of the history of <START:Chemical> ergot <END> includes its original discovery , the epidemics of <START:Disease> gangrene <END> that it has caused through the ages and its past and present role in the management of <START:Disease> migraine headache <END> .
Despite the advent of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockers and beta - adrenergic antagonists , <START:Chemical> ergot <END> preparations continue to play a major role in <START:Disease> migraine <END> therapy , so that the danger of <START:Disease> St . Anthony ' s fire <END> persists .
<START:Disease> Myoclonic , atonic , and absence seizures <END> following institution of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> therapy in children .
Five children , aged 3 to 11 years , treated with <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> for <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> , had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of <START:Disease> myoclonic , atypical absence and / or atonic ( minor motor ) seizures <END> within a few days .
When the <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> was discontinued , two of the children returned to their former state very quickly , two had the minor motor <START:Disease> seizures <END> resolve in 3 and 6 months , and one had the <START:Disease> seizures <END> persist .
The child in whom the <START:Disease> seizures <END> persisted was later found to have <START:Disease> ceroid lipofuscinosis <END> .
The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants .
Adverse reactions to <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> for the treatment of mild <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Report of Medical Research Council Working Party on Mild to Moderate <START:Disease> Hypertension <END> .
Participants in the Medical Research Council treatment trial for mild <START:Disease> hypertension <END> are randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups : <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> , <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , or a placebo for either of these drugs .
The trial is single - blind .
23 582 patient - years of observation have been completed so far , 10 684 on active drugs and 12 898 on placebos .
The results show an association between <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> treatment and <START:Disease> impotence <END> , and <START:Disease> impotence <END> also occurred more frequently in patients taking <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> than in those taking placebos .
Other adverse reactions significantly linked with active drugs include <START:Disease> impaired glucose tolerance <END> in men and women and <START:Disease> gout <END> in men , associated with <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> treatment , and <START:Disease> Raynaud ' s phenomenon <END> and <START:Disease> dyspnoea <END> in men and women taking <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> .
No <START:Disease> corneal disease <END> is known to have occurred in the <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> group .
Mean serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> level fell , and <START:Chemical> urea <END> and <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> levels rose , in men and women taking <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> .
In the <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> group , serum <START:Chemical> potassium <END> and <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> levels rose in both sexes , but the <START:Chemical> urea <END> level rose significantly in women only .
Postinfarction <START:Disease> ventricular septal defect <END> associated with long - term <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy .
Two cases of postinfarction <START:Disease> ventricular septal rupture <END> in patients on long - term <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy are presented and the favourable outcome in both cases described .
A possible association between <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy and subsequent postinfarction <START:Disease> septal rupture <END> is discussed .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> and cardiac protection for non - cardiac surgery : a meta - analysis of randomised controlled trials .
We conducted a systematic review of the effects of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> on cardiac outcomes following non - cardiac surgery .
We included prospective , randomised peri - operative studies of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> that reported mortality , cardiac morbidity or adverse drug events .
A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007 .
The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials .
Of 425 studies identified , 20 were included in the meta - analysis ( 840 patients ) .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> was associated with a trend towards improved cardiac outcomes ; all - cause mortality ( OR 0 . 27 , 95 % CI 0 . 01 - 7 . 13 , p = 0 . 44 ) , non - fatal <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( OR 0 . 26 , 95 % CI 0 . 04 - 1 . 60 , p = 0 . 14 ) , and <START:Disease> myocardial ischaemia <END> ( OR 0 . 65 , 95 % CI 0 . 26 - 1 . 63 , p = 0 . 36 ) .
Peri - operative <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( 26 % , OR 3 . 80 , 95 % CI 1 . 91 - 7 . 54 , p = 0 . 0001 ) and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> ( 17 % , OR 5 . 45 , 95 % CI 2 . 98 - 9 . 95 , p < 0 . 00001 ) were significantly increased .
An anticholinergic did not reduce the incidence of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> ( p = 0 . 43 ) .
A randomised placebo - controlled trial of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> is warranted .
<START:Chemical> Clarithromycin <END> - associated <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis .
<START:Disease> Visual hallucinations <END> are a rare event in <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> and not related to <START:Disease> uremia <END> per se .
Unreported in the literature is <START:Disease> visual hallucinations <END> occurring in association with the new <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antibiotic , <START:Chemical> clarithromycin <END> .
We describe such a case in a patient with <START:Disease> end - stage renal disease <END> ( <START:Disease> ESRD <END> ) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
The combination of a relatively high dose of <START:Chemical> clarithromycin <END> in face of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> in a functionally anephric patient , with underlying <START:Chemical> aluminum <END> intoxication , may have facilitated the appearance of this <START:Disease> neurotoxic <END> side effect .
It is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of <START:Disease> chronic renal failure <END> , the possibility of drug interactions , and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the <START:Disease> ESRD <END> patient .
<START:Chemical> Warfarin <END> - induced <START:Disease> leukocytoclastic vasculitis <END> .
Skin reactions associated with oral <START:Chemical> coumarin <END> - derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occurrence .
<START:Disease> Leukocytoclastic vasculitis <END> ( <START:Disease> LV <END> ) is primarily a <START:Disease> cutaneous small vessel vasculitis <END> , though systemic involvement may be encountered .
We report 4 patients with late - onset <START:Disease> LV <END> probably due to <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
All 4 patients presented with <START:Disease> skin eruptions <END> that developed after receiving <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> for several years .
The results of <START:Disease> skin lesion <END> biopsies were available in 3 patients , confirming <START:Disease> LV Cutaneous lesions <END> resolved in all patients after <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> was discontinued .
In 2 of the 4 patients , rechallenge with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> led to recurrence of the lesions .
<START:Disease> LV <END> may be a late - onset adverse reaction associated with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> therapy .
Long - term prognosis for transplant - free survivors of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : The prognosis for transplant - free survivors of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> remains unknown .
AIM : To examine whether <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> increases long - term mortality .
METHODS : We followed up all transplant - free survivors of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver injury <END> , hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984 - 2004 .
We compared age - specific mortality rates from 1 year post - discharge through 2008 between those in whom the <START:Disease> liver injury <END> led to an <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> and those in whom it did not .
RESULTS : We included 641 patients .
On average , age - specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver injury <END> had caused an <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1 . 70 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 - 2 . 85 ) , but the association was age - dependent , and no survivors of <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> died of <START:Disease> liver disease <END> , whereas suicides were frequent in both groups .
These observations speak against long - term effects of <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
More likely , the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of <START:Disease> substance abuse <END> among survivors of <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Paracetamol <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> did not affect long - term mortality .
Clinical follow - up may be justified by the cause of the <START:Disease> liver failure <END> , but not by the <START:Disease> liver failure <END> itself .
Failure of ancrod in the treatment of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced arterial <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
The morbidity and mortality associated with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> remain high despite numerous empirical therapies .
Ancrod has been used successfully for prophylaxis against development of <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> in patients with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> induced <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> who require brief reexposure to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , but its success in patients who have developed the <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> syndrome is not well defined .
The authors present a case of failure of ancrod treatment in a patient with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Chlorpropamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> .
A 65 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> adult - onset diabetes <END> treated with <START:Chemical> chlorpropamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> Diabenese <END> ) had a <START:Disease> toxic optic neuropathy <END> that resolved with discontinuation of <START:Chemical> chlorpropamide <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Visual loss <END> occurs in <START:Disease> diabetics <END> for a variety of reasons , and accurate diagnosis is necessary to institute appropriate therapy .
The possibility of a drug - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of <START:Disease> visual loss <END> in <START:Disease> diabetics <END> .
<START:Disease> Postoperative myalgia <END> after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> : no evidence for an inflammatory origin .
A common side effect associated with <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> is <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> .
The pathogenesis of this <START:Disease> myalgia <END> is still unclear ; <START:Disease> inflammation <END> has been suggested but without convincing evidence .
We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this <START:Disease> myalgia <END> .
The incidence and severity of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - associated <START:Disease> myalgia <END> was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> before <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> ( n = 32 for each ) .
Incidence and severity of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> did not differ significantly between the two groups : 15 patients in the <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> group complained of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> compared with 18 patients in the saline group , and severe <START:Disease> myalgia <END> was reported by five patients and three patients , respectively ( not significant ) .
At 48 h after surgery , 12 patients in both groups still suffered from <START:Disease> myalgia <END> ( not significant ) .
In addition , interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) as an early marker of <START:Disease> inflammation <END> was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with saline .
We found an increase of IL - 6 for only three patients , but only one patient reported <START:Disease> myalgia <END> ; no relationship between <START:Disease> myalgia <END> and the increase of IL - 6 was found .
In conclusion , there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - associated <START:Disease> myalgia <END> .
IMPLICATIONS : Administration of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> before <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - induced <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> .
Furthermore , there was no significant relationship between <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> and time course of interleukin - 6 concentrations , a marker of <START:Disease> inflammation <END> .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> is not justified to prevent <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> .
Time course alterations of QTC interval due to <START:Chemical> hypaque 76 <END> .
Sequential measurement of QT interval during left ventricular angiography was made 30 seconds and one , three , five and ten minutes after injection of <START:Chemical> hypaque 76 <END> .
The subjects were ten patients found to have normal left ventricles and coronary arteries .
Significant <START:Disease> QTC prolongation <END> occurred in 30 seconds to one minute in association with marked <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and elevation of cardiac output .
<START:Disease> Endometrial carcinoma <END> after <START:Disease> Hodgkin disease <END> in childhood .
A 34 - year - old patient developed metastic <START:Disease> endometrial carcinoma <END> after <START:Disease> Hodgkin disease <END> in childhood .
She had <START:Disease> ovarian failure <END> after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for <START:Disease> Hodgkin disease <END> , and received exogenous <START:Chemical> estrogens <END> , a treatment implicated in the development of <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> in menopausal women .
Young women on replacement <START:Chemical> estrogens <END> for <START:Disease> ovarian failure <END> after <START:Disease> cancer <END> therapy may also have increased risk of <START:Disease> endometrial carcinoma <END> and should be examined periodically .
Neuropeptide - Y immunoreactivity in the <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> model of <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> .
Neuropeptide - Y ( NPY ) is expressed by granule cells and mossy fibres of the hippocampal dentate gyrus during experimental <START:Disease> temporal lobe epilepsy <END> ( <START:Disease> TLE <END> ) .
This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block <START:Disease> seizure <END> - like events following high - frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices .
The <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PILO <END> ) model of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> is characterized by an acute period of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> followed by spontaneous recurrent <START:Disease> seizures <END> and related <START:Disease> brain damage <END> .
We report peroxidase - antiperoxidase immunostaining for NPY in several brain regions in this model .
<START:Chemical> PILO <END> - injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals , in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and , in a few cases , within presumed granule cells .
NPY immunoreactivity was also dramatically changed in the entorhinal cortex , amygdala and sensorimotor areas .
In addition , <START:Chemical> PILO <END> injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY - immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls .
The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression , including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons , are present in the <START:Chemical> PILO <END> model of <START:Disease> TLE <END> .
However , the significance of this changed synthesis of NPY remains to be determined .
High - dose <START:Chemical> tranexamic Acid <END> is associated with nonischemic clinical <START:Disease> seizures <END> in cardiac surgical patients .
BACKGROUND : In 2 separate centers , we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative <START:Disease> convulsive <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> from 1 . 3 % to 3 . 8 % in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures .
These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high - dose <START:Chemical> tranexamic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> TXA <END> ) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage .
The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between <START:Chemical> TXA <END> usage and <START:Disease> seizures <END> after cardiac surgery .
METHODS : An in - depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients , and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies .
RESULTS : Twenty - one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new <START:Disease> cerebral ischemic injury <END> , but <START:Disease> seizures <END> were likely due to <START:Disease> ischemic brain injury <END> in 3 patients .
All patients with <START:Disease> seizures <END> did not have permanent <START:Disease> neurological abnormalities <END> .
All 24 patients with <START:Disease> seizures <END> received high doses of <START:Chemical> TXA <END> intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg / kg , had a mean age of 69 . 9 years , and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures .
All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass .
No evidence of <START:Disease> brain ischemic <END> , metabolic , or <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> - induced causes for their <START:Disease> seizures <END> was apparent .
CONCLUSION : Our results suggest that use of high - dose <START:Chemical> TXA <END> in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open - chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical <START:Disease> seizures <END> in susceptible patients .
Neutrophil <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production in patients with <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> .
Defects in <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production may be implicated in the high incidence of <START:Disease> bacterial infections <END> in patients with <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> ( <START:Disease> ALF <END> ) .
In the present study , <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> radical production in patients with <START:Disease> ALF <END> due to <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> was compared with that of healthy volunteers .
Neutrophils from 14 <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with <START:Disease> ALF <END> or control serum .
<START:Chemical> Superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production by <START:Disease> ALF <END> neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with <START:Disease> ALF <END> serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Superoxide <END> and <START:Chemical> hydrogen peroxide <END> production in neutrophils stimulated with <START:Chemical> formyl - methionyl - leucyl - phenylalanine <END> ( <START:Chemical> fMLP <END> ) from a further 18 <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils .
Serum C 3 complement levels were significantly reduced in <START:Disease> ALF <END> patients compared with control subjects ( P < 0 . 0005 ) .
These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in <START:Disease> ALF <END> due to <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement , possibly connected to the complement receptor .
Treatment of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> with a <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> agonist in children .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> , a potent antagonist of both serotonergic ( 5 HT 2 A ) and dopaminergic D 2 receptors is associated with <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in adults and children .
Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with <START:Disease> prolactinomas <END> may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either <START:Disease> delayed puberty <END> or short stature .
These possibilities stress the importance of developing a safe and effective approach to drug - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in youth .
We report the successful treatment of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> in youth .
METHODS : We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> treated with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> .
RESULTS : Four males ( age 6 - 11 years ) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <START:Disease> Mental Disorders <END> ( fourth edition ) <START:Disease> bipolar disorder <END> or <START:Disease> psychoses <END> , with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced elevations in serum prolactin levels ( 57 . 5 - 129 ng / mL , normal 5 - 15 ng / mL ) , were treated with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> ( mean dose 2 . 13 + / - 0 . 09 mg / week ) .
When serum prolactin levels normalized in all four subjects ( mean 11 . 2 + / - 10 . 9 ng / mL ) , the <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> dose was reduced to 1 mg / week in three of four subjects .
The mean duration of therapy with <START:Chemical> cabergoline <END> was 523 . 5 + / - 129 . 7 days , and the mean duration of therapy with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> was 788 . 5 + / - 162 . 5 days .
<START:Chemical> Cabergoline <END> was well tolerated without adverse effects .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Cabergoline <END> may be useful for the treatment of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> in youth ; however , further research is needed .
A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB .
The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) and / or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound .
A Tween 80 - coated <START:Chemical> poly - L - lactid acid <END> nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system , able to trespass the BBB .
<START:Chemical> Tacrine <END> , administered in <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> pre - treated rats , induces electrocorticographic <START:Disease> seizures <END> and delayed <START:Disease> hippocampal damage <END> .
The toxic effects of <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - loaded <START:Chemical> poly - L - lactid acid <END> nanoparticles ( 5 mg / kg ) , a saline solution of <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i . p . administration in <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> - pre - treated Wistar rats .
All the animals treated with <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms , i . e . <START:Disease> epileptic <END> onset , with respect to those animals treated with the free compound ( 10 min vs . 22 min respectively ) .
In addition , <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - loaded nanoparticles administration induced <START:Disease> damage of neuronal cells <END> in CA 1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals , while the saline solution of <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> only in 60 % of animals .
Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control ( saline - treated ) group of animals .
In conclusion , the evaluation of time - to - onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> - <START:Chemical> lithium <END> model of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> in the rat , could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass ( or not ) the BBB in vivo .
Detailed spectral profile analysis of <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> in anesthetized rats .
<START:Chemical> Penicillin <END> model is a widely used experimental model for <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> research .
In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats .
Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i . p . <START:Chemical> urethane <END> and connected to an electrocorticogram setup .
After a short period of basal activity recording , <START:Disease> epileptic <END> focus was induced by injecting 400 IU / 2 microl <START:Chemical> penicillin - G potassium <END> into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded .
Basal activity , latent period and the <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis .
Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta , theta ( slow and fast ) , alpha - sigma , beta ( 1 and 2 ) and gamma ( 1 and 2 ) bands .
Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta , theta , beta - 2 and gamma - 2 bands during the <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes ( basal activity , latent period and <START:Disease> epileptiform activity <END> ) .
Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental <START:Disease> epilepsies <END> .
Gastrointestinal tolerability of <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> in <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> patients : results of the <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> vs <START:Chemical> diclofenac sodium <END> gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial ( EDGE - II ) .
OBJECTIVE : A randomised , double - blind study to compare the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tolerability , safety and efficacy of <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> and <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RA <END> ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 4086 patients ( mean age 60 . 8 years ) diagnosed with <START:Disease> RA <END> were enrolled and received <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> 90 mg daily ( n = 2032 ) or <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> 75 mg twice daily ( n = 2054 ) .
Use of gastroprotective agents and low - dose <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> was allowed .
The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences ( AEs ) .
General safety was also assessed , including adjudicated <START:Disease> thrombotic cardiovascular <END> event data .
Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status ( PGADS ; 0 - 4 point scale ) .
RESULTS : Mean ( SD ; maximum ) duration of treatment was 19 . 3 ( 10 . 3 ; 32 . 9 ) and 19 . 1 ( 10 . 4 ; 33 . 1 ) months in the <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> and <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> groups , respectively .
The cumulative discontinuation rate due to <START:Disease> GI AEs <END> was significantly lower with <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> than <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> ( 5 . 2 vs 8 . 5 events per 100 patient - years , respectively ; hazard ratio 0 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 , 0 . 81 ; p < or = 0 . 001 )) .
The incidence of discontinuations for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> - related and <START:Disease> oedema <END> - related AEs were significantly higher with <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> ( 2 . 5 % and 1 . 1 % respectively ) compared with <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> ( 1 . 5 % and 0 . 4 % respectively ; p < 0 . 001 for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and p < 0 . 01 for <START:Disease> oedema <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Etoricoxib <END> and <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> treatment resulted in similar efficacy ( PGADS mean changes from baseline - 0 . 62 vs - 0 . 58 , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Etoricoxib <END> 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to <START:Disease> GI AEs <END> compared with <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> 150 mg . Discontinuations from renovascular AEs , although less common than discontinuations from <START:Disease> GI AEs <END> , were significantly higher with <START:Chemical> etoricoxib <END> .
National project on the prevention of mother - to - infant <START:Disease> infection by hepatitis B virus <END> in Japan .
In Japan , a nationwide prevention program against mother - to - infant <START:Disease> infection by hepatitis B virus <END> ( HBV ) started in 1985 .
This program consists of double screenings of pregnant women and prophylactic treatment to the infants born to both <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> ) and <START:Chemical> hepatitis B e antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> ) positive mothers .
These infants are treated with two injections of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin ( HBIG ) and at least three injections of plasma derived <START:Chemical> hepatitis B vaccine <END> .
We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987 .
93 . 4 % pregnant women had the chance to be examined for <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> , and the positive rate was 1 . 4 to 1 . 5 % .
The <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> positive rate in <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> positive was 23 to 26 % .
The <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3 % and 2 % respectively .
Some problems may arise , because 27 to 30 % of infants need the fourth vaccination in some restricted areas .
<START:Disease> Cholestatic jaundice <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> .
We report a patient who developed <START:Disease> cholestatic jaundice <END> shortly after initiation of treatment with <START:Chemical> metformin hydrochloride <END> .
Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal .
An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy .
A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> , with portal <START:Disease> edema <END> , ductular proliferation , and acute <START:Disease> inflammation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Metformin hydrochloride <END> was discontinued , and the patient ' s <START:Disease> jaundice <END> resolved slowly over a period of several months .
Given the onset of his <START:Disease> jaundice <END> 2 wk after the initiation of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> , we believe that this case represents an example of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> - associated <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , the first such case reported .
The use of serum cholinesterase in <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> <START:Disease> apnoea <END> .
Fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged <START:Disease> apnoea <END> lasting several hours after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholinesterase .
Adequate spontaneous respiration was re - established in an average period of ten minutes after the injection .
In 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholinesterase .
In three patients none of the usual variants were found .
It is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> .
The use of serum cholinesterase in <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> <START:Disease> apnoea <END> provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthetist .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> <START:Disease> pulmonary toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side - effects , the most problematic being <START:Disease> pneumonitis <END> .
The <START:Disease> pulmonary toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and T cell - mediated <START:Disease> hypersensitivity pneumonitis <END> .
The clinical and radiographic features of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> - induced <START:Disease> pulmonary toxicity <END> are characteristic but nonspecific .
The diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities , such as <START:Disease> heart failure <END> , <START:Disease> infection <END> , and <START:Disease> malignancy <END> .
While withdrawal of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases , this is not always possible or advisable .
Dose reduction or concomitant <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy may have a role in selected patients .
<START:Chemical> Dexrazoxane <END> protects against <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> from the DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> and <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> but not <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
PURPOSE : The <START:Chemical> anthracyclines <END> <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and the <START:Chemical> epipodophyllotoxin <END> <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> are potent DNA cleavage - enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology ; however , <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> limit their use .
<START:Chemical> Dexrazoxane <END> ( <START:Chemical> ICRF - 187 <END> ) is recommended for protection against <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Because of their widespread use , the <START:Disease> hematologic toxicity <END> following coadministration of <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated : Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> , and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> + / - <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> was determined in granulocyte - macrophage colony forming assays .
Likewise , in vivo , B 6 D 2 F 1 mice were treated with <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> , and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> , with or without <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> over a wide range of doses : posttreatment , a full hematologic evaluation was done .
RESULTS : Nontoxic doses of <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> reduced <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> and <START:Disease> weight loss <END> from <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay ; however , <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> neither reduced <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> , <START:Disease> weight loss <END> , nor the in vitro <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> from <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
CONCLUSION : Although our findings support the observation that <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> clinically , the potent antagonism of <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> activity raises concern ; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention .
Our data also suggest that significant <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> .
Clinical trials in patients with brain <START:Disease> metastases <END> combining <START:Chemical> dexrazoxane <END> and high doses of <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating <START:Disease> hematologic toxicity <END> .
If successful , this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy .
Severe <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> patient on <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> presenting with <START:Disease> myxedemic coma <END> : a case report .
This is a case report of <START:Disease> myxedema coma <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> in a patient with severe <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) .
To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of <START:Disease> myxedema coma <END> during long term <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Myxedema coma <END> is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20 % with treatment .
The condition is treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> thyroxine <END> ( <START:Chemical> T 4 <END> ) or intravenous <START:Chemical> tri - iodo - thyronine <END> ( <START:Chemical> T 3 <END> ) .
Patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> on <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> , and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels .
This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> among <START:Disease> CHF <END> patients .
The myriad clinical presentation of <START:Disease> myxedema coma <END> and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among <START:Disease> CHF <END> patients presenting with <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> weakness <END> or other unexplained symptoms .
<START:Disease> Tetany <END> and <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> due to surreptitious <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> -- importance of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> supplementation .
Diuretics may induce <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> , <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> and <START:Disease> hypomagnesemia <END> .
While severe <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> may cause <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> , severe <START:Disease> hypomagnesemia <END> is associated with <START:Disease> muscle spasms <END> and <START:Disease> tetany <END> which cannot be corrected by <START:Chemical> potassium <END> and <START:Chemical> calcium <END> supplementation alone ( 1 , 2 ) .
Surreptitious diuretic ingestion has been described , mainly in women who are concerned that they are <START:Disease> obese <END> or <START:Disease> edematous <END> .
Symptomatic <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> has been reported in such patients ( 3 - 7 ) and in one case <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> was observed ( 8 ) , but the effects of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> depletion were not noted in these patients .
Management strategies for <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> hepatitis C <END> : clinical and economic implications .
OBJECTIVES : Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost - effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha - 2 b / <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> compared with <START:Chemical> interferon - alpha <END> monotherapy in the treatment of <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> ( <START:Disease> CHC <END> ) .
Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect : <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> ( <START:Disease> RIHA <END> ) .
The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health - care costs and management of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> during treatment of <START:Disease> CHC <END> in a clinical trial setting .
METHODS : A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> .
Decision - analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating <START:Disease> RIHA <END> .
Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> RIHA <END> , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / L , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with combination therapy .
The standard of care for management of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> is reduction or discontinuation of the <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> dosage .
We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant <START:Disease> RIHA <END> to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 - week treatment course ( range 68 - 692 ) .
The results of the one - way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 317 .
In comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16 , 459 .
CONCLUSIONS : The direct cost of treating clinically significant <START:Disease> RIHA <END> is 1 % ( 170 / 16 , 459 ) of drug treatment costs .
Questions remain about the optimal dose of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> and the incidence of <START:Disease> RIHA <END> in a real - world population .
Despite these uncertainties , this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating <START:Disease> RIHA <END> provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect .
Anti - <START:Disease> carcinogenic <END> action of <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> given simultaneously with <START:Chemical> diethylnitrosamine <END> in the rat .
The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> ( <START:Chemical> PB <END> : 15 mg per rat of ingested dose ) on <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> when it is administered simultaneously with <START:Chemical> diethylnitrosamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DEN <END> : 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Wistar rats ( 180 g ) were treated by <START:Chemical> DEN <END> alone or by <START:Chemical> DEN <END> + <START:Chemical> PB <END> during 2 , 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for <START:Disease> hepatocarcinogenesis <END> .
After the end of the treatment , the number and the size of induced PAS positive <START:Disease> preneoplastic foci <END> was significantly reduced when <START:Chemical> PB <END> was given simultaneously with <START:Chemical> DEN <END> for 4 and 6 weeks .
The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in <START:Chemical> DEN <END> treated rats were also significantly decreased in <START:Chemical> DEN <END> + <START:Chemical> PB <END> treated rats .
When the treatment last only 2 weeks , the presence of <START:Chemical> PB <END> did not change significantly the last parameters .
In <START:Chemical> DEN <END> + <START:Chemical> PB <END> treated rats , the survival was prolonged and the <START:Disease> tumor <END> incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by <START:Chemical> DEN <END> alone .
It is concluded that <START:Chemical> PB <END> , which promotes <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> when administered after the <START:Chemical> DEN <END> treatment , reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with <START:Chemical> DEN <END> .
This ' anti - carcinogen ' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the <START:Disease> precancerous lesions <END> .
Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this ' paradoxical ' <START:Chemical> PB <END> effect .
Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on <START:Chemical> bupropion hydrochloride <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice .
BACKGROUND : It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
This is important , since different controlled release formulations of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> release the active drug at different rates .
METHODS : We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg , a known <START:Disease> convulsive <END> dose 50 ( CD 50 ) , on the incidence and severity of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in the Swiss albino mice .
A total of 69 mice , approximately 7 weeks of age , and weighing 21 . 0 to 29 . 1 g were randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg treatment by intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration in 7 groups ( 9 to 10 animals per group ) .
<START:Chemical> Bupropion HCl <END> was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min , 15 min , 30 min , 60 min , 90 min , 120 min , and 240 min .
The number , time of onset , duration and the intensity of the <START:Disease> convulsions <END> or absence of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> were recorded .
RESULTS : The results showed that IP administration of <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg by bolus injection induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in 6 out of 10 mice ( 60 % of convulsing mice ) in group 1 . Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant ( p = 0 . 0004 ; odds ratio = 0 . 974 ) and increasing the IP infusion time of <START:Chemical> bupropion HCl <END> 120 mg / kg was associated with a 91 % reduced odds of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection .
Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> to 99 . 8 % reduction at 240 min .
CONCLUSION : In conclusion , the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and <START:Disease> convulsive <END> dose of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and the risk of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in a prospective study is novel .
Induction of the <START:Disease> obstructive sleep apnea syndrome <END> in a woman by exogenous <START:Chemical> androgen <END> administration .
We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54 - yr - old woman who had developed physical changes and the <START:Disease> syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea <END> while being administered exogenous <START:Chemical> androgens <END> .
When the <START:Chemical> androgens <END> were withdrawn , the patient ' s physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal .
A rechallenge with <START:Chemical> androgen <END> produced symptoms of <START:Disease> obstructive sleep apnea <END> that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone .
Previous reports have favored a role of <START:Chemical> androgens <END> in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> sleep apnea <END> .
Our report provides direct evidence for this role .
Structural and functional measurements indicate that <START:Chemical> androgens <END> exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep .
Development of the <START:Disease> obstructive sleep apnea syndrome <END> must be considered a possible side effect of <START:Chemical> androgen <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Cardiac arrest <END> after intravenous <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> - a case of five repeated injections of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> causing five episodes of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> .
We describe a patient where intravenous injection of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> was immediately followed by <START:Disease> asystole <END> repeatedly .
The patient received <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> 10 mg i . v . five times during 48 h .
After interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation , it is clear that every administration of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> was immediately ( within s ) followed by <START:Disease> asystole <END> .
The <START:Disease> asystole <END> lasted 15 - 30 s on four occasions , on one occasion it lasted 2 min .
The patient received <START:Chemical> atropine <END> 0 . 5 - 1 mg and chest compressions , before sinus rhythm again took over .
We interpret this as episodes of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> caused by <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> .
The rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction .
Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
A prospective , randomized , double - blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) refractory to medical treatment was designed .
Ten consecutive patients ( mean age , 58 . 4 + / - 6 . 8 years ; 7 men , 3 women ) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease ( mean disease time , 8 . 4 + / - 3 . 5 years ) , disabling motor fluctuations ( Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3 - 5 in off - drug phases ) and <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> were selected .
All patients had bilateral symptoms and their <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> equivalent dosing were analysed .
Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna ( GPi ) and four in the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) .
Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s Disease <END> Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Hoehn _ Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living ( ADL ) score in ' on ' - and ' off ' - drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery .
There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group .
Changes in UPDRS , Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups .
Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups .
Complications were observed in two patients : one had a left <START:Disease> homonymous hemianopsia <END> after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with <START:Chemical> Valproate <END> 1000 mg / day .
The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced <START:Disease> PD <END> refractory to medical treatment .
<START:Chemical> Yohimbine <END> treatment of <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> induced by <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers .
BACKGROUND : Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of <START:Disease> male impotence <END> .
A single case report suggests that <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> may be used to treat the <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> of <START:Chemical> clomipramine <END> .
This study evaluated <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> as a treatment for the <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> caused by <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers .
METHOD : Six patients with either <START:Disease> obsessive compulsive disorder <END> , <START:Disease> trichotillomania <END> , <START:Disease> anxiety <END> , or <START:Disease> affective disorders <END> who suffered <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> after treatment with <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers were given <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> on a p . r . n .
basis in an open clinical trial .
Various doses of <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient .
RESULTS : Five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> .
One patient who failed to comply with <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> treatment had no therapeutic effects .
Side effects of <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> included excessive sweating , increased <START:Disease> anxiety <END> , and a wound - up feeling in some patients .
CONCLUSION : The results of this study indicate that <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> may be an effective treatment for the <START:Disease> sexual side effects <END> caused by <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake blockers .
Future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> for this indication .
Epileptogenic activity of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> after drug induces <START:Disease> SLE <END> ( <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> and <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> )
OBJECTIVE : To study the effect of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> - containing multivitamin supplementation in <START:Disease> epileptic <END> women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural <START:Disease> birth defects <END> and <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - related side effects .
STUDY DESIGN : First a randomised trial , later periconception care including in total 12225 females .
RESULTS : Of 60 <START:Disease> epileptic <END> women with periconceptional <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> ( 0 . 8 mg ) - containing multivitamin supplementation , no one developed <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - related side effects during the periconception period .
One <START:Disease> epileptic <END> woman delivered a newborn with <START:Disease> cleft lip and palate <END> .
Another patient exhibited with a cluster of <START:Disease> seizures <END> after the periconception period using another multivitamin .
This 22 - year - old <START:Disease> epileptic <END> woman was treated continuously by <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> and a <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> ( 1 mg ) - containing multivitamin from the 20 th week of gestation .
She developed <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> and later symptoms of <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematodes <END> .
Her pregnancy ended with <START:Disease> stillbirth <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : The <START:Disease> epileptic <END> pregnant patient ' s <START:Disease> autoimmune disease <END> ( probably drug - induced <START:Disease> lupus <END> ) could damage the blood - brain barrier , therefore the therapeutic dose ( > or = 1 mg ) of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> triggered a cluster of <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Physiological dose ( < 1 mg ) of <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> both in healthy and 60 <START:Disease> epileptic <END> women , all without any <START:Disease> autoimmune disease <END> , did not increase the risk for <START:Disease> epileptic seizures <END> .
Why may <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> EACA <END> ) induce <START:Disease> myopathy <END> in man ?
Report of a case and literature review .
A case of <START:Disease> necrotizing myopathy <END> due to a short <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> EACA <END> ) treatment in a 72 year - old patient with <START:Disease> subarachnoid haemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> SAH <END> ) is described .
Pathogenetic hypotheses are discussed .
<START:Chemical> Valproate <END> - induced <START:Disease> chorea <END> and <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> in atypical <START:Disease> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> is a <START:Disease> disorder of amino acid metabolism <END> in which a defect in the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> cleavage system leads to an accumulation of <START:Chemical> glycine <END> in the brain and other body compartments .
In the classical form it presents as neonatal <START:Disease> apnea <END> , intractable <START:Disease> seizures <END> , and <START:Disease> hypotonia <END> , followed by significant <START:Disease> psychomotor retardation <END> .
An important subset of children with <START:Disease> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous manner .
This report describes a patient with mild <START:Disease> language delay <END> and <START:Disease> mental retardation <END> , who was found to have <START:Disease> nonketotic hyperglycinemia <END> following her presentation with acute <START:Disease> encephalopathy <END> and <START:Disease> chorea <END> shortly after initiation of <START:Chemical> valproate <END> therapy .
Tolerability of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in patients with <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
Previous studies evaluated the tolerance of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in subjects with cutaneous , respiratory and anaphylactoid reactions induced by <START:Chemical> nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs <END> ( <START:Chemical> NSAIDs <END> ) .
In this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well - documented history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
Furthermore , we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> and <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> .
A single - placebo - controlled oral challenge procedure with <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> or <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> was applied to 829 patients with a history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
A total of 75 / 829 ( 9 . 4 % ) patients experienced reactions to <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> or <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> .
Of the 715 patients tested with <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> 62 ( 8 . 6 % ) showed a positive test , while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> , 13 ( 9 . 6 % ) did not tolerate this drug .
Furthermore , 18 . 28 % of patients with a history of chronic <START:Disease> urticaria <END> and 11 . 8 % of subjects with an history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> or <START:Disease> angioedema <END> alone ( with or without chronic <START:Disease> urticaria <END> ) resulted to be intolerant to alternative drugs .
Taken together , our results confirm the good tolerability of <START:Chemical> nimesulide <END> and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> in patients who experienced <START:Disease> urticaria <END> / <START:Disease> angioedema <END> caused by <START:Chemical> NSAIDs <END> .
However , the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic <START:Disease> urticaria <END> and , above all , by a history of <START:Chemical> NSAID <END> - induced <START:Disease> angioedema <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> in high dose <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> chemotherapy .
<START:Chemical> Carboplatin <END> has been reported to cause <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> when administered in high doses to adult patients .
We report a 4 1 / 2 - year - old girl who was treated with high - dose <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> for metastatic parameningeal <START:Disease> embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function .
Possible contributing factors are discussed .
<START:Chemical> Spironolactone <END> : is it a novel drug for the prevention of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> - related <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> in <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients ?
OBJECTIVE : <START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> is the major adverse effect of <START:Chemical> amphotericin B <END> ( <START:Chemical> AmB <END> ) , often limiting administration of full dosage .
Selective distal tubular epithelial <START:Disease> toxicity <END> seems to be responsible for the profound <START:Chemical> potassium <END> wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with <START:Chemical> AmB <END> .
<START:Chemical> Potassium <END> depletion also potentiates the tubular <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> AmB <END> .
This study was designed to assess the ability of <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> to reduce <START:Chemical> potassium <END> requirements and to prevent <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> in <START:Disease> neutropenic <END> patients on <START:Chemical> AmB <END> treatment .
METHODS : In this study 26 patients with various <START:Disease> hematological disorders <END> were randomized to receive either intravenous <START:Chemical> AmB <END> alone or <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and oral <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected <START:Disease> fungal infection <END> .
RESULTS : Patients receiving concomitant <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> had significantly higher plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels than those receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> alone ( P = 0 . 0027 ) .
Those patients receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> required significantly less <START:Chemical> potassium <END> supplementation to maintain their plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> within the normal range ( P = 0 . 022 ) .
Moreover , urinary <START:Chemical> potassium <END> losses were significantly less in patients receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> and <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> than those receiving <START:Chemical> AmB <END> alone ( P = 0 . 040 ) .
CONCLUSION : This study showed that <START:Chemical> spironolactone <END> can reduce <START:Chemical> potassium <END> requirements and prevent <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> by reducing urinary <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss in <START:Disease> neutropenic <END> patients on <START:Chemical> AmB <END> treatment .
Epileptogenic properties of <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and their clinical interpretation .
Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> anesthesia are reported .
In one patient , <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Until the cause of the <START:Disease> seizures <END> was correctly identified , the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants .
Two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized <START:Disease> seizures <END> uncontrolled by medication .
<START:Disease> Epileptic <END> foci delineated and activated by <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> were surgically ablated and the patients are now <START:Disease> seizure <END> - free .
Previous exposures to <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG .
On the other hand , <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of <START:Disease> epileptic <END> foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings .
<START:Disease> Hepatotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> in inflammatory <START:Disease> arthritis <END> : A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events .
BACKGROUND : Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) are handicapped by under - reporting and limited detail on individual cases .
We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti - rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of <START:Disease> liver failure <END> in two of our patients .
METHODS : Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years .
Patients ' , who had <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> on <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> and met a definition of a serious ADR , were identified .
Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument .
The likely frequency of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions .
RESULTS : Ten cases were identified : eight occurred during surveillance .
Eight patients were hospitalised , two in <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> - one died after a liver transplant .
All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment .
Seven patients had a <START:Disease> skin rash <END> , three <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> and one <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> .
Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent .
Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six .
Drug - related <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients .
The likely frequency of serious <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> was estimated at 0 . 4 % of treated patients .
CONCLUSION : Serious <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> sulfasalazine <END> appears to be under - appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .
<START:Chemical> Ethopropazine <END> and <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> in neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> .
In a 12 - week controlled study <START:Chemical> ethopropazine <END> was compared to <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> induced by <START:Chemical> fluphenazine enanthate <END> in 60 <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> outpatients .
<START:Chemical> Ethopropazine <END> and <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> were found to be equally effective in controlling <START:Disease> parkinsonian symptoms <END> and were as efficacious as <START:Chemical> procyclidine <END> , their previous antiparkinsonian drug .
However , <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> treated patients had a significant increase in <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> compared to their condition during <START:Chemical> procyclindine <END> treatment , and significantly more <START:Disease> anxiety <END> and <START:Disease> depression <END> than <START:Chemical> ethopropazine <END> treated patients .
This suggests that <START:Chemical> benztropine <END> is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonian symptoms <END> , because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect .
Fear - potentiated <START:Disease> startle <END> , but not light - enhanced <START:Disease> startle <END> , is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs .
RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES : The light - enhanced <START:Disease> startle <END> paradigm ( LES ) is suggested to model <START:Disease> anxiety <END> , because of the non - specific cue and the long - term effect .
In contrast , the fear - potentiated <START:Disease> startle <END> ( FPS ) is suggested to model conditioned fear .
However , the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar .
The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms .
METHODS : Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha ( 2 ) - adrenoceptor antagonist <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> ( 0 . 25 - 1 . 0 mg / kg ) , the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ( 2 C ) receptor agonist <START:Chemical> m - chlorophenylpiperazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> mCPP <END> , 0 . 5 - 2 . 0 mg / kg ) or the <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) inverse receptor agonist <START:Chemical> pentylenetetrazole <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> , 3 - 30 mg / kg ) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS .
RESULTS : None of the drugs enhanced LES , whereas <START:Chemical> mCPP <END> increased percentage FPS and <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> increased absolute FPS values .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> increased baseline <START:Disease> startle <END> amplitude in the LES , while <START:Chemical> mCPP <END> suppressed baseline <START:Disease> startle <END> in both the LES and FPS and <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> suppressed baseline <START:Disease> startle <END> in the FPS .
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm , none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response .
Thus , a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS .
Mitochondrial DNA and its respiratory chain products are defective in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> induces a self - perpetuating <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> characterized by early <START:Disease> glomerular and late - onset tubular lesions <END> in rats .
We investigated the potential role of <START:Disease> mitochondrial injury <END> in the onset of these lesions .
METHODS : Rats were treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 mg kg ( - 1 ) week ( - 1 )) for 7 weeks and were sacrificed either 1 week ( ' short - term ' ) or 30 weeks ( ' long - term ' ) following the last dose .
Additional rats received a single dose either 6 days or 2 h prior to euthanasia .
All rats were killed at 48 weeks of age .
<START:Disease> Glomerular and tubular injury <END> was monitored and correlated to the activity or expression of respiratory chain components .
Finally , we quantified both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) as well as <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> production and the 4834 base pair ' common ' mtDNA deletion .
RESULTS : The ' long - term ' group had significant <START:Disease> glomerular and tubular lesions <END> , depressed activities of mtDNA - encoded NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome - c oxidase ( COX ) and increased <START:Chemical> citrate <END> synthase activity .
In addition , expression of the mtDNA - encoded COX subunit I was reduced and mtDNA levels were decreased .
In ' short - term ' rats , there were fewer <START:Disease> tubular lesions <END> , but similar numbers of <START:Disease> glomerular lesions <END> activity .
Among all animals , <START:Disease> glomerular and tubular injury <END> were inversely correlated with mtDNA levels , mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain activities and with the expression of the mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain subunit COX - I .
Injury was positively correlated with <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> production and the activities of nucleus - encoded mitochondrial or cytoplasmic enzymes .
Kidneys from the ' long - term ' group showed more mtDNA deletions than in ' short - term ' animals and these were not observed in the other groups .
CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest an important role for quantitative and qualitative mtDNA alterations through the reduction of mtDNA - encoded respiratory chain function and induction of <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> in <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal lesions <END> .
Obsolete but dangerous antacid preparations .
One case of acute <START:Disease> hypercalcaemia <END> and two of recurrent <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> are reported in patients who had regularly consumed large amounts of <START:Chemical> calcium carbon - ate <END> - <START:Chemical> sodium bicarbonate <END> powders for more than 20 years .
The powders had been obtained from pharmacists unknown to the patients ' medical practitioners .
It is suggested that these preparations were responsible for the patient ' s problems , and that such powders should no longer be freely obtainable .
Beta - 2 - adrenoceptor - mediated <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> and its abolishment by <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> .
The time course and concentration - effect relationship of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> was studied , using computer - aided pharmacokinetic - dynamic modeling .
Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> in antagonizing such <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> , together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs .
Six healthy subjects were given a 0 . 5 mg subcutaneous dose of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> on two occasions : 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> orally .
In the 7 - hour period after <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> administration , plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> levels and drug concentrations .
The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> concentrations and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> effects .
<START:Chemical> Oxprenolol <END> caused decreases of 65 % and 56 % of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> volume of distribution and clearance , respectively , and an increase of 130 % of its AUC .
In spite of higher <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> concentrations after <START:Chemical> oxprenolol <END> pretreatment , the <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2 - blocking action .
A phase II study of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in advanced metastatic <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and activity of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in patients with advanced metastatic <START:Disease> renal cell cancer <END> and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) 165 , with therapy .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : 29 patients were enrolled on a study of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> using an intra - patient dose escalation schedule .
Patients began <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> at 400 mg / d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg / d by day 54 .
Fifty - nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL - 2 and 52 % were performance status 2 or 3 .
Systemic plasma VEGF 165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients .
RESULTS : 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary <START:Disease> metastases <END> ( 4 % ) , one minor response , and 2 patients stable for over 6 months .
<START:Disease> Somnolence <END> and <START:Disease> constipation <END> were prominent <START:Disease> toxicities <END> and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg / day dose level .
Systemic plasma VEGF 165 levels did not change with therapy .
CONCLUSION : These results are consistent with a low level of activity of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> in <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> .
Administration of doses over 800 mg / day was difficult to achieve in this patient population , however lower doses were practical .
The dose - response relationship , if any , of <START:Chemical> thalidomide <END> for <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> is unclear .
Results of a comparative , phase III , 12 - week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double - blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed - dose combination of <START:Chemical> telmisartan <END> and <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> versus <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> monotherapy in Indian adults with stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed - dose combination ( FDC ) of <START:Chemical> telmisartan <END> 40 mg + <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> 5 mg ( T + A ) compared with <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> 5 - mg monotherapy ( A ) in adult Indian patients with stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
METHODS : This comparative , Phase III , 12 - week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double - blind study was conducted in Indian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Patients were treated with oral FDC of T + A or A QD before breakfast for 12 weeks ; blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate were measured in the sitting position .
Primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic BP ( SBP ) / diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie , patients who achieved target SBP / DBP < 130 / < 80 mm Hg ) at end of study .
Tolerability was assessed by treatment - emergent adverse events , identified using physical examination , laboratory analysis , and electrocardiography .
RESULTS : A total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study ; 203 patients ( 143 men , 60 women ) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow - up ( 4 patients in the T + A group and 3 in the A group ) and considered with - drawn .
At study end , statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in SBP ( T + A [ - 27 . 4 % ] ;
A [ - 16 . 6 % ] ) and DBP ( T + A [ - 20 . 1 % ] ;
A [ - 13 . 3 % ] ) ( all , P < 0 . 05 ) .
Response rates were 87 . 3 % ( 89 / 102 ) in the T + A group and 69 . 3 % ( 70 / 101 ) in the A group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
The prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups ( T + A , 16 . 0 % [ 17 / 106 ] ; A , 15 . 4 % [ 16 / 104 ] ) .
Peripheral <START:Disease> edema <END> was reported in 8 . 5 % patients ( 9 / 106 ) in the T + A group compared with 13 . 5 % ( 14 / 104 ) in the A group , and <START:Disease> cough <END> was reported in 3 . 8 % patients ( 4 / 106 ) in the T + A group and 1 . 0 % ( 1 / 104 ) patients in the A group ; these differences did not reach statistical significance .
The incidences of <START:Disease> headache <END> , <START:Disease> dizziness <END> , and <START:Disease> diarrhea <END> were similar between the 2 groups .
CONCLUSIONS : Among these Indian patients with stage II <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , the FDC of T + A was found to be significantly more effective , with regard to BP reductions , than A , and both treatments were well tolerated .
<START:Disease> Hypoxia <END> in <START:Disease> renal disease <END> with <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and / or glomerular <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level , relatively few methods have been available .
In this study , we developed a new <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - responsive reporter vector using a <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - responsive element of the 5 ' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - sensing transgenic rat .
We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> in the <START:Disease> diseased kidney <END> .
With this model , we were able to identify diffuse cortical <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> in the <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> and focal and segmental <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> in the remnant kidney model .
Expression of the <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> - responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period , reaching 2 . 2 - fold at 2 weeks in the <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> model and 2 . 6 - fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model , whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease , reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes .
The degree of <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> showed a positive correlation with microscopic <START:Disease> tubulointerstitial injury <END> in both models .
Finally , we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen - positive , ED - 1 - positive , and terminal dUTP nick - end labeled - positive cells in the <START:Disease> hypoxic <END> cortical area in the remnant kidney model .
We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial <START:Disease> hypoxia <END> and progressive <START:Disease> glomerular diseases <END> .
Anxiogenic potential of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> in rats .
INTRODUCTION : The possible anxiogenic effects of <START:Chemical> fluoroquinolones <END> , namely <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> , were investigated in adult Charles Foster albino rats of either sex , weighing 150 - 200 g .
METHODS : The drugs were given orally , in doses of 50 mg / kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day .
The tests included open - field exploratory behaviour , elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze , social interaction and novelty - suppressed feeding latency behaviour .
RESULTS : The results indicate that <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> - treated rats showed <START:Disease> anxious behaviour <END> in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studied .
However , <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> - treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameters .
CONCLUSION : The present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxiogenic potential of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> and <START:Chemical> norfloxacin <END> .
Fatal <START:Disease> haemopericardium <END> and <START:Disease> gastrointestinal haemorrhage <END> due to possible interaction of cranberry juice with <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
We report a case of fatal internal <START:Disease> haemorrhage <END> in an elderly man who consumed only cranberry juice for two weeks while maintaining his usual dosage of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
We propose that naturally occurring compounds such as <START:Chemical> flavonoids <END> , which are present in fruit juices , may increase the potency of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> by competing for the enzymes that normally inactivate <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> .
While traditionally regarded as foodstuffs , consumption of fruit juices should be considered when patients develop adverse drug reactions .
<START:Disease> Catalepsy <END> induced by combinations of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> : potentiation , antagonism , tolerance and cross - tolerance in the rat .
Previous studies demonstrated that both <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> induced <START:Disease> analgesia <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in the rat .
Pre - treatment with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> produced cross - tolerance to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , whereas pretreatment with <START:Chemical> morphine <END> did not induce cross - tolerance to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> but rather augmented the <START:Disease> cataleptic <END> response ; this augmentation was attributed to residual <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in the brain .
The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub - effective doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , administered simultaneously .
There was mutual potentiation between sub - effective doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , but sub - effective doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> partly antagonized fully - effective doses of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Latency to the loss of righting reflex , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> and behavior on recovery , reflected the relative predominance of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> or <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in each combination .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> inhibited the induced <START:Disease> cataleptic <END> effects .
The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub - effective dose combinations of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> and <START:Chemical> morphine <END> were similar .
Rats , tolerant to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - dominant combinations , were cross - tolerant to both drugs , while those tolerant to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - dominant combinations were cross - tolerant to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> but showed either no cross - tolerance or an augmented response to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
While the mutual potentiation , antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , differences in latency , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> and behavior , asymmetry of cross - tolerance and a widely - different ID 50 for <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> would argue against an action at a single opioid site .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> combined with <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> in the first - line treatment of advanced <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> .
In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> ( <START:Chemical> Taxol <END> ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) given as a 3 - hour infusion in combination with <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> administered every 21 days to women with advanced <START:Disease> ovarian cancer <END> , <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> doses were escalated as follows : level 1 , 135 mg / m 2 ; level 2 , 160 mg / m 2 ; level 3 , 185 mg / m 2 ; and level 4 , 210 mg / m 2 .
The fixed dose of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) of 5 using the Calvert formula .
In levels 5 and 6 the <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7 . 5 , respectively , combined with a fixed <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> dose of 185 mg / m 2 .
To date , 30 previously untreated patients , all with a good performance status ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2 ) have been entered into this ongoing study .
The dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of the combination was <START:Disease> myelosuppression <END> ( <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> , <START:Disease> granulocytopenia <END> , and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxicity <END> was largely moderate .
So far , 14 patients are evaluable for response ; of these , eight ( 57 % ) showed objective ( complete or partial ) response and disease stabilized in six patients .
No patient had disease progression .
We conclude that the combination of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> 185 mg / m 2 administered as a 3 - hour infusion followed immediately by a 1 - hour infusion of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21 - day schedule in the outpatient setting .
The recommended dose for phase III studies is <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> 185 mg / m 2 and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> AUC 6 .
Definition and management of <START:Disease> anemia <END> in patients <START:Disease> infected with hepatitis C virus <END> .
<START:Disease> Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus <END> ( HCV ) can progress to <START:Disease> cirrhosis <END> , <START:Disease> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> , and <START:Disease> end - stage liver disease <END> .
The current best treatment for <START:Disease> HCV infection <END> is combination therapy with pegylated <START:Chemical> interferon <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( SVRs ) in approximately 50 % of patients , it can be associated with a potentially dose - limiting <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> , and this <START:Disease> anemia <END> can be problematic in patients with <START:Disease> HCV infection <END> , especially those who have comorbid <START:Disease> renal or cardiovascular disorders <END> .
In general , <START:Disease> anemia <END> can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality , and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life .
Although <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - associated <START:Disease> anemia <END> can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation , this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates .
Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> - associated <START:Disease> anemia <END> but has other potential disadvantages .
<START:Chemical> Viramidine <END> , a liver - targeting prodrug of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> while decreasing the risk of <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> in patients with <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute renal failure <END> in patients with <START:Disease> AIDS <END> on <START:Chemical> tenofovir <END> while receiving prolonged <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> course for <START:Disease> osteomyelitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Renal failure <END> developed after a prolonged course of <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> therapy in 2 patients who were receiving <START:Chemical> tenofovir disoproxil fumarate <END> as part of an antiretroviral regimen .
<START:Chemical> Tenofovir <END> has been implicated in the development of <START:Disease> Fanconi syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule .
<START:Chemical> Vancomycin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> agent .
Clinicians should be aware that <START:Chemical> tenofovir <END> may raise the risk of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> during prolonged administration of <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> .
<START:Disease> Myocardial infarction <END> in pregnancy associated with <START:Chemical> clomiphene citrate <END> for ovulation induction : a case report .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Clomiphene citrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> CC <END> ) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction .
It is considered safe , with minimal side effects .
<START:Disease> Thromboembolism <END> is a rare but life - threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
Spontaneous <START:Disease> coronary thrombosis <END> or <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:Disease> MI <END> ) during pregnancy , with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram .
CASE : A 33 - year - old woman with a 5 - week gestation had recently received <START:Chemical> CC <END> for ovulation induction and presented with <START:Disease> chest pain <END> .
An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9 . 10 ng / mL .
An initial exercise stress test was normal .
At the time of admission , the patient was at high risk of <START:Disease> radiation injury <END> to the fetus , so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester .
It showed normal coronary vessels .
CONCLUSION : This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between <START:Chemical> CC <END> and <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
<START:Disease> Thrombosis <END> might be a rare but hazardous complication of <START:Chemical> CC <END> .
Given this life - threatening complication , appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high - risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation .
Electrocardiographic changes and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> in patients receiving psychotropic drugs .
Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life - threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs , either <START:Chemical> phenothiazines <END> or tricyclic antidepressants .
Although most patients were receiving several drugs , <START:Chemical> Mellaril <END> ( <START:Chemical> thioridazine <END> ) appeared to be responsible for five cases of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> , one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman .
<START:Disease> Supraventricular tachycardia <END> developed in one patient receiving <START:Chemical> Thorazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> chlorpromazine <END> ) .
<START:Chemical> Aventyl <END> ( <START:Chemical> nortriptyline <END> ) and <START:Chemical> Elavil <END> ( <START:Chemical> amitriptyline <END> ) each produced <START:Disease> left bundle branch block <END> in a 73 year old woman .
Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients .
The <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> responded to intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and to direct current electric shock ; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> combined with ventricular pacing in one .
The <START:Disease> tachyarrhythmias <END> generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped .
Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger ; only one clearly had antecedent <START:Disease> heart disease <END> .
Major <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> are a potential hazard in patients without <START:Disease> heart disease <END> who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs .
A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of <START:Disease> cardiac complications <END> to patients receiving <START:Chemical> phenothiazines <END> or tricyclic antidepressant drugs .
Acute blood pressure elevations with <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in men with borderline systemic <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> are enhanced in <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> persons has not been demonstrated .
Thus , <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years ) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions .
Borderline <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( BP ) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and / or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg .
Low - risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and had screening BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg .
Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 - hour abstinence from <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits .
<START:Chemical> Caffeine <END> - induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8 . 4 vs + 3 . 8 mm Hg , p < 0 . 0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance - derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45 dynes . s . cm - 5 , p < 0 . 004 ) .
These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols .
The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % .
Consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> BP levels after <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> ingestion .
Thus , in borderline <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> men , exaggerated responses to <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> were : selective for diastolic BP , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative of nearly all borderline <START:Disease> hypertensives <END> .
We suspect that the potential for <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> induced by combined <START:Chemical> levomepromazine <END> - <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> treatment .
We report a case of combined <START:Chemical> levomepromazine <END> - <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> treatment - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
It seems that combined treatment of <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> with <START:Chemical> phenothiazines <END> may possess proconvulsive activity .
Nightmares and <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> after long - term intake of <START:Chemical> tramadol <END> combined with antidepressants .
<START:Chemical> Tramadol <END> is a weak opioid with effects on adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission that is used to treat <START:Disease> cancer <END> <START:Disease> pain <END> and chronic non malignant <START:Disease> pain <END> .
This drug was initiated in association with <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> dosulepine hydrochloride <END> in a <START:Disease> tetraparetic <END> patient with <START:Disease> chronic pain <END> .
Fifty - six days after initiation of the treatment the patient presented <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> that only stopped after the withdrawal of psycho - active drugs and <START:Chemical> tramadol <END> .
The case report questions the long term use of <START:Disease> pain <END> killers combined with psycho - active drugs in chronic non malignant <START:Disease> pain <END> , especially if <START:Disease> pain <END> is under control .
Chronic effects of a novel synthetic <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> derivative ( <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> ) on normal heart and <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in beagle dogs .
This study was designed to investigate the chronic <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> potential of <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> and a possible deteriorating effect of <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> on low - grade <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> pre - induced by <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> in beagle dogs .
In the chronic treatment , beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks , either a sublethal dose of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) .
The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing .
Animals which received over six courses of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> demonstrated the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , decrease of blood pressure and high - grade histopathological <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> administration did not show any changes in ECG , blood pressure and histopathological examinations .
To examine a possibly deteriorating <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> , low - grade <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> was induced in dogs by four courses of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) .
Nine weeks after pre - treatment , dogs were given four courses of either <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) or <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) once every 3 weeks .
The low - grade <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> changes were enhanced by the additional <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> treatment .
On the contrary , the <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> treatment did not progress the grade of <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
In conclusion , <START:Chemical> SM - 5887 <END> does not have any potential of chronic <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and deteriorating effect on <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> in dogs .
<START:Chemical> Debrisoquine <END> phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta - 2 receptor pharmacodynamics of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and its enantiomers .
The metabolism of the cardioselective beta - blocker <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> is under genetic control of the <START:Chemical> debrisoquine <END> / <START:Chemical> sparteine <END> type .
The two metabolic phenotypes , extensive ( EM ) and poor metabolizers ( PM ) , show different stereoselective metabolism , resulting in apparently higher beta - 1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> in EMs .
We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta - 2 adrenoceptor antagonism by <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
The drug effect studied was the antagonism by <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> .
By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and the active S - isomer , were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC 50 values , representing <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> plasma concentrations resulting in half - maximum receptor occupancy .
Six EMs received 0 . 5 mg of <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> s . c . on two different occasions : 1 ) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2 ) 1 hr after 150 mg of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> p . o .
Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol , except for a higher <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> dose ( 0 . 75 mg ) on day 2 .
Blood samples for the analysis of plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> , <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> ( racemic , R - and S - isomer ) , and <START:Chemical> alpha - hydroxymetoprolol <END> concentrations were taken at regular time intervals , during 8 hr after <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
In PMs , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> increased the <START:Chemical> terbutaline <END> area under the plasma concentration vs . time curve ( + 67 % ) .
Higher <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> / <START:Chemical> alpha - hydroxymetoprolol <END> ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R - / S - isomer ratios of unchanged drug .
There was a difference in <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> potency with higher racemic <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> IC 50 values in PMs ( 72 + / - 7 ng . ml - 1 ) than EMs ( 42 + / - 8 ng . ml - 1 , P less than . 001 ) . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Transient <START:Disease> hemiparesis <END> : a rare manifestation of <START:Chemical> diphenylhydantoin <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Report of two cases .
Among the common side effects of <START:Chemical> diphenylhydantoin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DPH <END> ) <START:Disease> overdose <END> , the most frequently encountered neurological signs are those of <START:Disease> cerebellar dysfunction <END> .
Very rarely , the toxic neurological manifestations of this drug are of cerebral origin .
Two patients are presented who suffered progressive <START:Disease> hemiparesis <END> due to <START:Chemical> DPH <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
Both had brain surgery before <START:Chemical> DPH <END> treatment .
It is assumed that patients with some <START:Disease> cerebral damage <END> are liable to manifest <START:Chemical> DPH <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> as focal neurological signs .
Selective injection of <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> , <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> and <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> into the left coronary artery of the dog .
Induction of <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> and decrease of aortic pressure .
In twenty beagle dogs selective injections were made into the left coronary artery with <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> , <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> and <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> in doses of 4 ml , 8 ml and 16 ml . Thirty - six <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> injections , 35 <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> injections and 37 <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> injections were made .
Frequencies of <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> were significantly lower ( p less than 0 . 05 ) after <START:Chemical> iopentol <END> ( 0 % ) and <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> ( 3 % ) than after <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> ( 22 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Iopentol <END> and <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> also produced significantly less decrease in aortic blood pressure than <START:Chemical> metrizoate <END> at the different doses .
Systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and resuscitation in <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - , <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> - , or <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> - infused rats .
We compared the systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> , and <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> in anesthetized rats .
We also compared the ability to resuscitate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthetics .
<START:Chemical> Bupivacaine <END> , <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> , or <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> was infused at a rate of 2 mg . kg ( - 1 ) . min ( - 1 ) while electrocardiogram , electroencephalogram , and arterial pressure were continuously monitored .
When <START:Disease> asystole <END> was recorded , drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was begun .
<START:Chemical> Epinephrine <END> 0 . 01 mg / kg was administered at 1 - min intervals while external cardiac compressions were applied .
Resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure > or = 100 mm Hg was achieved within 5 min .
The cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> that produced <START:Disease> seizures <END> were similar and were larger than those of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
The cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> that produced <START:Disease> dysrhythmias <END> and <START:Disease> asystole <END> were smaller than the corresponding doses of <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> , but they were larger than those of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> .
The number of successful resuscitations did not differ among groups .
However , a smaller dose of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> was required in the <START:Chemical> Ropivacaine <END> group than in the other groups .
We conclude that the systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> is intermediate between that of <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> when administered at the same rate and that <START:Chemical> ropivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> or <START:Chemical> levobupivacaine <END> .
Dynamic response of blood vessel in <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
In this study we postulated that during <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> induced by <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected , and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels .
The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered , but also dynamics of this response , was used in this paper .
Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals .
The beneficial effects of <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> administration to <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals are also confirmed through : lower level of blood <START:Chemical> urea <END> and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and higher level of <START:Chemical> potassium <END> .
The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals ( 8 . 07 + / - 1 . 7 s vs . 5 . 64 + / - 0 . 18 s ) .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values .
The pressure dynamic properties , quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic , confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - treated animals and beneficial effects of <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> administration .
Rosaceiform <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> associated with topical <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> treatment .
We describe herein 3 patients who developed <START:Disease> rosacea <END> - like <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> <START:Disease> eruptions <END> while using 0 . 03 % or 0 . 1 % <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ointment for <START:Disease> facial dermatitis <END> .
Skin biopsy specimens showed <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> and noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous tissue formation in the papillary to mid dermis .
Continuous topical use of immunomodulators such as <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> or <START:Chemical> pimecrolimus <END> should be regarded as a potential cause of rosaceiform <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> , although many cases have not been reported .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> , and <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
Sixty - two patients with a <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> are reported .
Clinical manifestations of this disorder include <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> or , more frequently , <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> events in patients receiving <START:Chemical> heparin <END> .
Laboratory testing has revealed <START:Disease> a falling platelet count <END> , increased resistance to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , and aggregation of platelets by the patient ' s plasma when <START:Chemical> heparin <END> is added .
Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - dependent platelet membrane antibody .
The 20 deaths , 52 <START:Disease> hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications <END> , and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder .
Specific risk factors have not been identified ; therefore , all patients receiving <START:Chemical> heparin <END> should be monitored .
If the platelet count falls to less than 100 , 000 / mm 3 , while the patient is receiving <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> testing , using the patient ' s plasma , is indicated .
Management consists of cessation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , platelet anti - aggregating agents , and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated .
Effect of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> on gross behavioural changes produced by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> in cats .
The effect of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> injected into the cerebral ventricles of group - housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization ( rage , hissing and snarling ) , fighting ( attack with paws and claws , defense with paws and claws and biting ) , <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> , <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> clonic - tonic convulsions <END> produced by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> injected similarly was investigated .
<START:Chemical> Calcium chloride <END> depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> .
On the other hand , <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> , <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> clonic - tonic convulsions <END> evoked by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> were not significantly changed by <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> .
It is apparent that <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> can " dissociate " vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as <START:Disease> mydriasis <END> , <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> clonic - tonic convulsions <END> caused by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Calcium chloride <END> inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> and <START:Chemical> eserine <END> most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites .
These results further support the view that <START:Chemical> calcium <END> ions in excess have an <START:Chemical> atropine <END> - like action also in the central nervous system .
DSMM XI study : dose definition for intravenous <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> / <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> myeloma <END> .
A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> and <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> multiple myeloma <END> ( <START:Disease> MM <END> ) .
Thirty patients were treated with three 21 - day cycles of <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> 1 . 3 mg / m ( 2 ) on days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 plus <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> 40 mg on the day of <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> injection and the day after plus <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> at 900 , 1 , 200 , or 1 , 500 mg / m ( 2 ) on day 1 .
The maximum tolerated dose of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> was defined as 900 mg / m ( 2 ) .
At this dose level , 92 % of patients achieved at least a partial response .
The overall response rate [ complete response ( CR ) plus partial response ( PR ) ] across all dose levels was 77 % , with a 10 % CR rate .
No patient experienced progressive disease .
The most frequent adverse events were <START:Disease> hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities <END> as well as <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> .
The results suggest that <START:Chemical> bortezomib <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> at 900 mg / m ( 2 ) and <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> MM <END> that warrants further investigation .
Refractory <START:Disease> cardiogenic shock <END> and complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> after <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> SR and <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> treatment .
A case report .
A seventy - eight - year - old woman presented with complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> and refractory <START:Disease> hypotension <END> two days after a therapeutic dose of sustained - release <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> with concomitant use of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> .
The patient continued to remain <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> with complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> , even with multiple uses of intravenous <START:Chemical> atropine <END> as well as high doses of pressor agents such as <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> .
However , shortly after the use of intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> , the refractory <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> resolved .
Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable <START:Disease> non - small cell lung cancer <END> with <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> : a phase II trial .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> ( <START:Chemical> Taxol <END> ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different <START:Disease> tumor <END> types , notably <START:Disease> ovarian and breast carcinoma <END> .
Two phase II trials of 24 - hour <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> infusions in chemotherapy - naive patients with stage IIIB or IV <START:Disease> non - small cell lung cancer <END> ( <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> ) reported response rates of 21 % and 24 % .
<START:Disease> Leukopenia <END> was dose limiting : as many as 62 . 5 % of patients experienced grade 4 <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> .
We investigated the efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of a 3 - hour <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
The 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women ) had a median age of 59 years ( age range , 25 to 75 ) and a performance status of 0 through 2 .
Most patients ( 72 . 4 % ) had stage IV <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> 225 mg / m 2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication .
Of 50 patients evaluable for response , 12 ( 24 % ) had partial remission , 26 ( 52 % ) had no change , and 12 had disease progression ( 24 % ) .
Hematologic <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were mild : only one patient ( 2 % ) developed grade 3 or 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> , while 29 % had grade 1 or 2 .
Grade 1 or 2 <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> affected 56 % of patients while only one ( 2 % ) experienced severe <START:Disease> polyneuropathy <END> .
Similarly , grade 1 or 2 <START:Disease> myalgia <END> / <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> was observed in 63 . 2 % of patients , but only 14 . 3 % experienced grade 3 or 4 .
<START:Disease> Nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> were infrequent , with 14 % of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2 % experiencing grade 3 or 4 .
<START:Chemical> Paclitaxel <END> is thus an active single agent in this patient population , with a 3 - hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 - hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Further phase II studies with <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> combined with other drugs active against <START:Disease> NSCLC <END> are indicated , and phase III studies comparing <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed .
<START:Disease> Cognitive deterioration <END> from long - term abuse of <START:Chemical> dextromethorphan <END> : a case report .
<START:Chemical> Dextromethorphan <END> ( <START:Chemical> DM <END> ) , the dextrorotatory isomer of <START:Chemical> 3 - hydroxy - N - methylmorphinan <END> , is the main ingredient in a number of widely available , over - the - counter antitussives .
Initial studies ( Bornstein 1968 ) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability .
Subsequently , however , several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature .
The drug is known to cause a variety of acute toxic effects , ranging from <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> restlessness <END> , <START:Disease> insomnia <END> , <START:Disease> ataxia <END> , slurred speech and <START:Disease> nystagmus <END> to mood changes , perceptual alterations , inattention , disorientation and <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> ( Rammer et al 1988 ; Katona and Watson 1986 ; Isbell and Fraser 1953 ; Devlin et al 1985 ; McCarthy 1971 ; Dodds and Revai 1967 ; Degkwitz 1964 ; Hildebrand et al 1989 ) .
There have also been two reported fatalities from <START:Chemical> DM <END> overdoses ( Fleming 1986 ) .
However , there are no reports describing the effects of chronic abuse .
This report describes a case of <START:Disease> cognitive deterioration <END> resulting from prolonged use of <START:Chemical> DM <END> .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cyclosporin A <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> : inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase .
<START:Chemical> Cyclosporin A <END> ( <START:Chemical> CsA <END> ; 50 mg / kg ) and <START:Chemical> Fujimycine <END> ( <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> ; 5 mg / kg ) , but not the related <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> immunosuppressant <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) , caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate , degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium , and <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days .
The molecular mechanisms of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were investigated .
Cyclophilin A and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> - binding protein , the main intracytoplasmic receptors for <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , respectively , were each detected in renal tissue extract .
In the kidney , high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , but not by <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> .
Finally , specific immunophilin - drug - calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> , but not <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> .
These results suggest that the <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> CsA <END> and <START:Chemical> FK 506 <END> is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase .
Comparison of aqueous and gellan ophthalmic <START:Chemical> timolol <END> with placebo on the 24 - hour heart rate response in patients on treatment for <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> .
PURPOSE : Topical beta - blocker treatment is routine therapy in the management of patients with <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> .
Therapy results in systemic absorption , however , the degree of reduction of resting and peak heart rate has not been quantified .
DESIGN : This trial evaluated the effect of placebo , 0 . 5 % aqueous <START:Chemical> timolol <END> ( <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution ) and a 0 . 5 % <START:Chemical> timolol <END> suspension that forms a gel on application to the conjunctiva ( <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan ) on the 24 - hour heart rate in patients currently being treated for <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> to quantify the reduction in mean heart rate .
METHODS : Forty - three Caucasian patients with primary <START:Disease> open - angle glaucoma <END> or <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> with a mean ( + / - SD ) age of 63 ( + / - 8 ) years were randomized and crossed over in a double - masked manner to 14 days of treatment with placebo ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution ( morning and evening in both eyes ) , or <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan ( morning in both eyes with placebo in the evening ) .
On the 13 th day of each period , heart rate was recorded continuously during a typical , ambulant 24 - hour period .
RESULTS : Both <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution and <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan reduced the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo ( P < or = . 001 ) , and this reduction was most pronounced during the daytime ( - 7 . 5 % change in mean heart rate , - 5 . 7 beats / min ) .
<START:Chemical> Timolol <END> gellan showed a numerically but not significantly smaller reduction in 24 - hour heart rate , compared with <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution .
During the night , the mean 12 - hour heart rate on placebo and <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan were both significantly less than on <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution ; the difference between solution and gellan treatments was statistically significant ( P = . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : Both <START:Chemical> timolol <END> solution and <START:Chemical> timolol <END> gellan decrease the mean 24 - hour heart rate compared with placebo .
This response was most pronounced during the active daytime period .
These data quantify the modest <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> associated with ophthalmic beta - blocker therapy in a typical patient population on therapy for <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> .
Although exercise performance was not assessed in this trial , reductions of this magnitude should not have substantial clinical consequences .
Urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of <START:Disease> injury to different regions of the kidney <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute experimental models of renal damage <END> to the proximal tubular , glomerular , and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of <START:Chemical> hexachloro - 1 : 3 - butadiene <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCBD <END> ) , <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> 2 - bromoethylamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> BEA <END> ) , respectively .
Several routine indicators of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase , and the molecular weight of <START:Disease> protein excretion <END> were determined on urine samples .
Tubular damage produced by <START:Chemical> HCBD <END> or <START:Chemical> BEA <END> was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from <START:Disease> glomerular damage <END> produced by <START:Chemical> PAN <END> .
The latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in <START:Disease> protein excretion <END> , especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40 , 000 Da .
In contrast , <START:Disease> protein excretion <END> in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by <START:Disease> excretion of proteins <END> of a wide range of molecular weights .
Proximal tubular damage caused by <START:Chemical> HCBD <END> and papillary damage caused by <START:Chemical> BEA <END> were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity ) and by measurement of the two urinary enzymes .
Alkaline phosphatase and <START:Chemical> glucose <END> were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and N - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary damage .
It is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of <START:Disease> renal damage <END> .
<START:Disease> Angioedema <END> associated with <START:Chemical> droperidol <END> administration .
<START:Disease> Angioedema <END> , also known as <START:Disease> angioneurotic edema <END> or <START:Disease> Quincke ' s disease <END> , is a well - demarcated , localized <START:Disease> edema <END> involving the subcutaneous tissues that may cause <START:Disease> upper - airway obstruction <END> .
We report the case of a previously healthy 19 - year - old man with no known <START:Disease> drug allergies <END> in whom <START:Disease> angioedema <END> with significant <START:Disease> tongue swelling <END> and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single IV dose of <START:Chemical> droperidol <END> .
Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> .
PURPOSE : To map and identify the pattern , in vivo , of <START:Disease> axonal degeneration <END> in <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
<START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> .
A serious complication of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> is an <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> that impairs visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and color vision .
However , early on , when the toxic <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> is mild and partly reversible , the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss .
METHODS : Three subjects with a history of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> ( <START:Chemical> EMB <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> of short - , intermediate - , and long - term <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> were administered a full neuro - ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity , color vision , contrast sensitivity , and fundus examination .
In addition , OCT ( OCT 3000 , Humphrey - Zeiss , Dublin , CA ) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) analysis protocol .
OCT interpolates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the RNFL .
RESULTS : The results were compared to the calculated average RNFL of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using OCT , n = 661 .
In all subjects with history of <START:Chemical> EMB <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> , there was a mean loss of 72 % nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient A , with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields , 58 % loss ; patient B , with intermediate <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> , 68 % loss ; patient C , with chronic <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> , 90 % loss ) , with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / - 16 microm .
There was a combined mean loss of 46 % of fibers from the superior , inferior , and nasal quadrants in the ( six ) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / - 29 microm ) .
In both sets ( four ) of eyes of the subjects with persistent <START:Disease> visual deficits <END> ( patients B and C ) , there was an average loss of 79 % of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant .
CONCLUSIONS : The OCT results in these patients with <START:Chemical> EMB <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers .
This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo - cellular axons ( or small - caliber axons ) within the papillo - macular bundle in toxic or hereditary <START:Disease> optic neuropathies <END> .
OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of <START:Disease> optic neuropathies <END> .
Additionally , in terms of management of <START:Chemical> EMB <END> - induced <START:Disease> optic neuropathy <END> , it is important to properly manage <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> dosing in patients with <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached .
<START:Chemical> Metformin <END> prevents experimental <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> by a mitochondria - dependent pathway .
The antidiabetic drug <START:Chemical> metformin <END> can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent <START:Disease> vascular dysfunction <END> even in nondiabetic patients .
Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
Mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> administration .
<START:Chemical> Metformin <END> treatment fully blocked <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - mediated <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
This was accompanied by a lower activity of N - acetyl - beta - D - glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems .
<START:Chemical> Metformin <END> also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> administration .
These in vivo markers of <START:Disease> kidney dysfunction <END> and their correction by <START:Chemical> metformin <END> were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function .
We found that <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , NADH ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores .
These injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by <START:Chemical> metformin <END> .
Thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of <START:Chemical> metformin <END> can lessen <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and improve mitochondrial homeostasis .
Treatment of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> urothelial toxicity <END> by oral administration of <START:Chemical> sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonate <END> ( <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> ) to patients with inoperable <START:Disease> lung cancer <END> .
The protective effect of oral administration of the <START:Chemical> thiol <END> compound <START:Chemical> sodium 2 - mercaptoethane sulphonate <END> ( <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> ) against <START:Disease> urothelial toxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> IF <END> ) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable <START:Disease> lung cancer <END> under treatment with <START:Chemical> IF <END> ( 2250 mg / m 2 on days 2 - 5 ) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4 - week cycle .
<START:Chemical> MESNA <END> was given orally on the days of treatment with <START:Chemical> IF <END> in 3 doses of 840 mg / m 2 , each administered at 0 hr ( = injection of <START:Chemical> IF <END> ) , 4 hr and 8 hr p . i .
Out of a total of 88 courses of this treatment we observed 10 episodes of asymptomatic microscopic <START:Disease> haematuria <END> and no episodes of gross <START:Disease> haematuria <END> .
In this group of 45 patients under protection with <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions ( total 31 % ) .
A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with <START:Chemical> IF <END> were treated by conventional prophylactic measures ( raised fluid intake and forced diuresis ) .
In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions ( total 24 % ) , but nearly all patients developed either gross <START:Disease> haematuria <END> and / or symptoms of <START:Disease> bladder irritation <END> ( <START:Disease> cystitis <END> and <START:Disease> pollakisuria <END> ) .
There were no appreciable differences between the <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of the cytostatic treatment .
Our results support the view that <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> , given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include <START:Chemical> IF <END> , simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium .
Protection with oral <START:Chemical> MESNA <END> is particularly suitable for outpatients .
High - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> may do more harm for <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> .
Because of the National Acute <START:Disease> Spinal Cord Injury <END> Studies ( NASCIS ) , high - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> became the standard of care for the acute <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> .
In the NASCIS , there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> that high - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> may cause .
The dosage of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> ever being used during a 2 - day period for any clinical condition .
We hypothesize that it may cause some <START:Disease> damage to the muscle <END> of <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> patients .
Further , <START:Chemical> steroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , instead of any protection that <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> offers to the <START:Disease> spinal cord injury <END> .
To our knowledge , this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> recommended by NASCIS may cause acute <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary <END> associated with antecedent <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use .
BACKGROUND : Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
Review of the literature reveals an association between <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use and gynecologic <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
CASE : A 52 - year - old postmenopausal woman was treated with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> for stage II <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> receptor - positive <START:Disease> breast carcinoma <END> .
Her <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> transaminase and <START:Chemical> alanine <END> transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use .
After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases , the patient was found to have a stage Ic <START:Disease> granulosa cell tumor of the ovary <END> .
CONCLUSION : Patients with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> - induced <START:Disease> liver dysfunction <END> may be at increased risk for <START:Disease> granulosa cell tumors <END> because of alterations in <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> metabolism .
Placebo - level incidence of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> ( <START:Disease> EPS <END> ) with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> in controlled studies of patients with <START:Disease> bipolar mania <END> .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> ( <START:Disease> EPS <END> ) , including <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> in patients with <START:Disease> bipolar mania <END> .
METHODS : Data were analyzed from four similarly designed , randomized , double - blind , 3 - to 12 - week studies .
Two studies evaluated <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> monotherapy ( up to 800 mg / day ) ( n = 209 ) versus placebo ( n = 198 ) , with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> or <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> monotherapy as respective active controls .
Two studies evaluated <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> ( up to 800 mg / day ) in combination with a mood stabilizer ( <START:Chemical> lithium <END> or <START:Chemical> divalproex <END> , <START:Chemical> QTP <END> + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ) ( n = 196 ) compared to placebo and mood stabilizer ( PBO + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ) ( n = 203 ) .
<START:Disease> Extrapyramidal symptoms <END> were evaluated using the Simpson - Angus Scale ( SAS ) , the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) , adverse event reports and anticholinergic drug usage .
RESULTS : The incidence of <START:Disease> EPS <END> - related adverse events , including <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , was no different with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> monotherapy ( 12 . 9 % ) than with placebo ( 13 . 1 % ) .
Similarly , <START:Disease> EPS <END> - related adverse events with <START:Chemical> QTP <END> + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 21 . 4 % ) were no different than with PBO + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 19 . 2 % ) .
Adverse events related to <START:Disease> EPS <END> occurred in 59 . 6 % of patients treated with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( n = 99 ) monotherapy , whereas 26 . 5 % of patients treated with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> ( n = 98 ) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to <START:Disease> EPS <END> .
The incidence of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> was low and similar with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> monotherapy ( 3 . 3 % ) and placebo ( 6 . 1 % ) , and with <START:Chemical> QTP <END> + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 3 . 6 % ) and PBO + <START:Chemical> Li <END> / <START:Chemical> DVP <END> ( 4 . 9 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> was associated with a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 05 ) of <START:Disease> tremor <END> ( 18 . 4 % ) than <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> ( 5 . 6 % ) ; cerebellar <START:Disease> tremor <END> , which is a known adverse effect of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , may have contributed to the elevated rate of <START:Disease> tremor <END> in patients receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> induced a significantly higher incidence ( p < 0 . 001 ) of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> ( 33 . 3 % versus 5 . 9 % ) , <START:Disease> tremor <END> ( 30 . 3 % versus 7 . 8 % ) , and <START:Disease> extrapyramidal syndrome <END> ( 35 . 4 % versus 5 . 9 % ) than <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> .
No significant differences were observed between <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> and placebo on SAS and BARS scores .
Anticholinergic use was low and similar with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> or placebo .
CONCLUSIONS : In <START:Disease> bipolar mania <END> , the incidence of <START:Disease> EPS <END> , including <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> therapy is similar to that with placebo .
<START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> in perfusion - cultured human eyes .
PURPOSE : Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> corticosteroid glaucoma <END> in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility .
The purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes .
METHODS : The anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow , variable pressure perfusion culture system .
Paired eyes were perfused in serum - free media with or without 10 ( - 7 ) M <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> for 12 days .
Intraocular pressure was monitored daily .
After incubation , the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy , transmission and scanning electron microscopy , and scanning laser confocal microscopy .
RESULTS : A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> with an average pressure rise of 17 . 5 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg after 12 days of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> exposure .
The contralateral control eyes , which did not receive <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> , maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period .
The outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal .
In contrast , the <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - treated <START:Disease> hypertensive eyes <END> had thickened trabecular beams , decreased intertrabecular spaces , thickened juxtacanalicular tissue , activated trabecular meshwork cells , and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material , especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm .
The <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - treated nonresponder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes , although several subtle <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced morphologic changes were evident .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> treatment of isolated , perfusion - cultured human eyes led to the generation of <START:Disease> ocular hypertension <END> in approximately 30 % of the <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - treated eyes .
<START:Chemical> Steroid <END> treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for <START:Disease> corticosteroid glaucoma <END> and <START:Disease> open angle glaucoma <END> .
This system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in <START:Disease> steroid glaucoma <END> and <START:Disease> primary open angle glaucoma <END> .
<START:Chemical> Remifentanil <END> pretreatment reduces <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : The aim of the study was to compare the effect of pretreatment with <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> 1 microg / kg and the effect of gender on the incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after anesthesia induction with <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> .
DESIGN : This was a randomized , double - blind study .
SETTING : The study was conducted at a university hospital .
PATIENTS : Sixty patients were pretreated in a randomized double - blinded fashion with <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> 1 microg / kg or placebo .
Two minutes after <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> or placebo injection , <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> 0 . 3 mg / kg was given .
MEASUREMENTS : <START:Disease> Myoclonus <END> was recorded with a scale of 0 to 3 .
The grade of sedation ( none , mild , moderate , severe ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , <START:Disease> pruritus <END> , and <START:Disease> apnea <END> were recorded after injection of both drugs .
MAIN RESULTS : The incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> was significantly lower in the <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> group ( 6 . 7 % ) than in the placebo group ( 70 % ) ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
None of the patients experienced sedation , <START:Disease> apnea <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , or <START:Disease> pruritus <END> after injection of both drugs .
In the placebo group , male patients were associated with significantly increased incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> administration .
CONCLUSION : Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> 1 microg / kg reduced <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> induction without side effects such as sedation , <START:Disease> apnea <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> , or <START:Disease> pruritus <END> .
Men experience increased incidence of <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> than women after <START:Chemical> etomidate <END> administration .
Association of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> production and apoptosis in a model of experimental <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
BACKGROUND : In recent studies increased amounts of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney .
We have studied the role of <START:Chemical> NO <END> and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> induced by a single injection of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ) .
METHODS : The alteration in the <START:Chemical> NO <END> pathway was assessed by measuring <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney ( IPRK ) system .
Rats were stratified into control groups and <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> groups .
These two groups were then divided into : group 1 , animals receiving saline ; and group 2 , animals receiving <START:Chemical> aminoguanidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AG <END> ) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible - <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase .
On day 21 , rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis .
RESULTS : Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with <START:Chemical> ADR <END> revealed focal areas of <START:Disease> mesangial proliferation <END> and mild <START:Disease> tubulointerstitial inflammation <END> .
They also had significantly higher levels of <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> compared with control and treatment groups ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
Urine <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> levels were significantly increased in the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
In the IPRK <START:Chemical> phenylephrine <END> and <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> related responses were significantly impaired in the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group .
Apoptosis was not detected in controls .
However , in the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> group , numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas .
Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED 1 , a marker for monocytes / macrophages .
Treatment with <START:Chemical> AG <END> prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> levels and apoptosis to control levels .
CONCLUSION : We suggest that interactions between <START:Chemical> NO <END> and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the <START:Chemical> ADR <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> .
Circulating lysosomal enzymes and <START:Disease> acute hepatic necrosis <END> .
The activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , N - acetylglucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> .
Acid protease ( cathepsin D ) activity was increased about tenfold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> after <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , whereas activities were increased equally in patients with <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> due to <START:Disease> viral hepatitis <END> whether or not they survived .
A correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin D activity was sustained over several days compared with <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> aminotransferase , which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall .
Circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs , and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition .
Case report : <START:Chemical> Dexatrim <END> ( <START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ) as a cause of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) is a sympathetic <START:Chemical> amine <END> used in over - the - counter cold remedies and weight - control preparations worldwide .
Its use has been associated with <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> episodes and <START:Disease> hemorrhagic strokes <END> in younger women .
Several reports have linked the abuse of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> with <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> , especially when <START:Disease> overdose <END> is involved .
We report here the first case of <START:Chemical> Dexatrim <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight control .
In addition , we review the 7 other cases of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> related <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> that have been reported so far .
Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of <START:Chemical> PPA <END> , even at doses generally considered to be safe .
Behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> on <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - treated mice .
The effects of <START:Chemical> dizocilpine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ) , a noncompetitive <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptor antagonist , were studied on <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - related behaviors induced by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> treatments .
This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , or <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> , and its response after glutamatergic blockage .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered once every other day for 4 days , produced increases in <START:Disease> orofacial dyskinesia <END> , tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice , which are signs indicative of <START:Disease> tardive dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> also produced <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , which are signs suggestive of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) , administered 30 min before the observation test , prevented the vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
However , <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> injection produced a significant increase of <START:Disease> tremor <END> in <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - treated mice .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) , administered 90 min before the test and followed by <START:Chemical> apomophine <END> injection ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) 5 min before the test , did not produce <START:Disease> oral dyskinesia <END> in mice .
On the other hand , <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> induced increases in <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> compared to control mice .
<START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) administration attenuated the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and <START:Disease> tremor <END> induced by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg ) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion , as well as increases in <START:Disease> tremor <END> and <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , whereas <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 0 . 1 mg / kg ) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> .
These results show that <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> produces different and <START:Disease> abnormal movements <END> , which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> - like and <START:Disease> tardive dsykinesia <END> signs .
The glutamatergic blockage produced by <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> can restore these signs , such as vacuous chewing movements , tongue protrusions , <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and <START:Disease> tremor <END> according to the employed model .
<START:Disease> Neuromuscular blockade <END> with <START:Chemical> magnesium sulfate <END> and <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> .
A patient who received tocolysis with <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> developed <START:Disease> neuromuscular blockade <END> after 500 mg of <START:Chemical> magnesium sulfate <END> was administered .
This reaction demonstrates that <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> can seriously potentiate the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> .
Caution should be exercised when these two tocolytics are combined .
Worsening of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> by motor and mental tasks .
Ten patients who had <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> with disabling <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental ( mental calculation ) and motor ( flexion / extension of right fingers , flexion / extension of left fingers , flexion / extension of the neck , speaking aloud ) tasks on the worsening of peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> following administration of an effective single dose of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> .
Compared with the score at rest ( 1 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 ) , a significant aggravation of the <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> score was observed during speaking aloud ( 5 . 2 + / - 1 . 1 , p < 0 . 05 ) , movements of right ( 4 . 5 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) and left ( 3 . 7 + / - 0 . 8 , p < 0 . 05 ) fingers , movements of the neck ( 5 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) , and mental calculation ( 3 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 , p < 0 . 05 ) .
These results suggest that activation tasks such as " speaking aloud " could be used for objective assessment of <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> severity .
Activation of <START:Chemical> poly ( ADP - ribose ) <END> polymerase contributes to development of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
Activation of the nuclear enzyme <START:Chemical> poly ( ADP - ribose ) <END> polymerase ( PARP ) by oxidant - mediated DNA damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress .
Increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ) , a widely used antitumor <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> antibiotic .
Thus , we hypothesized that the activation of PARP may contribute to the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Using a dual approach of PARP - 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phenanthridinone PARP inhibitor <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> , we now demonstrate the role of PARP in the development of <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> induced by <START:Chemical> DOX <END> .
PARP - 1 + / + and PARP - 1 - / - mice received a single injection of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ( 25 mg / kg i . p ) .
Five days after <START:Chemical> DOX <END> administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in PARP - 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in PARP - 1 - / - ones .
Similar experiments were conducted in BALB / c mice treated with <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> or vehicle .
Treatment with a <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> significantly improved <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> and increased the survival of the animals .
In addition <START:Chemical> PJ 34 <END> significantly reduced the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - induced increase in the serum <START:Chemical> lactate <END> dehydrogenase and <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart .
Thus , PARP activation contributes to the <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> .
PARP inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe <START:Disease> cardiac complications <END> associated with the <START:Chemical> DOX <END> treatment .
Post - operative <START:Disease> rigidity <END> after <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> administration .
A case of thoraco - abdominal <START:Disease> rigidity <END> leading to <START:Disease> respiratory failure <END> is described in the post - operative period in an elderly patient who received a moderate dose of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> .
This was successfully reversed by <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> .
The mechanisms possibly implicated in this accident are discussed .
<START:Disease> Water intoxication <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> administration during saline - induced <START:Disease> abortion <END> .
Four cases of <START:Disease> water intoxication <END> in connection with <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> administration during saline - induced <START:Disease> abortions <END> are described .
The mechanism of <START:Disease> water intoxication <END> is discussed in regard to these cases .
<START:Chemical> Oxytocin <END> administration during midtrimester - induced <START:Disease> abortions <END> is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff , aware of the symptoms of <START:Disease> water intoxication <END> and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as <START:Disease> asthenia <END> , muscular <START:Disease> irritability <END> , or <START:Disease> headaches <END> .
The <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> should be given only in Ringers <START:Chemical> lactate <END> or , alternately , in Ringers <START:Chemical> lactate <END> and a 5 per cent <START:Chemical> dextrose <END> and water solutions .
The urinary output should be monitored and the <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases .
The <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> should not be administered in excess of 36 hours .
If the patient has not aborted by then the <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance .
Reversible <START:Disease> cerebral lesions <END> associated with <START:Chemical> tiazofurin <END> usage : MR demonstration .
<START:Chemical> Tiazofurin <END> is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation .
We report our results with magnetic resonance ( MR ) in demonstrating reversible <START:Disease> cerebral abnormalities <END> concurrent with the use of this drug .
The abnormalities on MR were correlated with findings on CT as well as with cerebral angiography .
The utility of MR in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> is not essential for the development of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
It is widely believed that <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) mediates <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> to brain dopaminergic neurons , because drugs that interfere with <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurotransmission decrease <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , whereas drugs that increase <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurotransmission enhance <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
However , temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain <START:Chemical> DA <END> neurotransmission confound interpretation of the data .
Here we show that the recently reported ability of <START:Chemical> L - dihydroxyphenylalanine <END> to reverse the protective effect of <START:Chemical> alpha - methyl - para - tyrosine <END> on <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Chemical> DA <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is also confounded by drug effects on body temperature .
Further , we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain <START:Chemical> DA <END> develop <START:Chemical> METH <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> , as long as the thermic effects of <START:Chemical> METH <END> are preserved .
In addition , we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain <START:Chemical> DA <END> deficits develop <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> dopaminergic deficits <END> that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain .
Taken together , these findings demonstrate that <START:Chemical> DA <END> is not essential for the development of <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced dopaminergic <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> and suggest that mechanisms independent of <START:Chemical> DA <END> warrant more intense investigation .
Modification of drug action by <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> ammonium acetate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> ) ( 6 mmol / kg s . c . ) approximately doubled the time <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - treated mice remained on a hot surface and similarly increased muscular <START:Disease> incoordination <END> by <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , but <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> treatment alone had no effect .
Thus , <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> is capable of altering drug action and must be considered along with impaired drug metabolism in enhanced drug responses associated with <START:Disease> liver disease <END> .
Experiments in vitro showed that <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> - induced <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50 % by 0 . 3 mM <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> and <START:Chemical> KCl <END> - induced contractions of guinea - pig ileum were inhibited 20 % by 5 mM <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> .
Addition of excess <START:Chemical> calcium <END> reversed the <START:Disease> depression <END> in both tissues , but <START:Chemical> calcium <END> - independent <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> release by <START:Chemical> acetaldehyde <END> was not blocked by <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> .
These results suggested that <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> blocks <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channels .
Parallels in the actions of <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> and the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> support this concept .
Both <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> ( 10 mg / kg i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> pretreatment enhanced <START:Chemical> morphine <END> <START:Disease> analgesia <END> - and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced muscular <START:Disease> incoordination <END> and antagonized <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced motor activity , and neither <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> nor <START:Chemical> NH 4 Ac <END> affected the convulsant action of <START:Chemical> metrazol <END> .
The data suggest that <START:Disease> hyperammonemia <END> exerts a <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocking action which enhances the effects of central nervous system depressants and certain opioid analgesics .
<START:Disease> Renal papillary necrosis <END> due to <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> .
A 31 - year - old man with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , who had previously been treated with <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> , <START:Chemical> fenoprofen calcium <END> , high dose <START:Chemical> salicylates <END> and <START:Chemical> gold <END> salts , developed <START:Disease> renal papillary necrosis <END> ( <START:Disease> RPN <END> ) 4 months after institution of <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> therapy .
No other factor predisposing to <START:Disease> RPN <END> could be discovered .
<START:Chemical> Sulindac <END> was substituted for <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> and no further adverse renal effects occurred over the next 12 months .
We review previous reports linking <START:Disease> RPN <END> to antiinflammatory drug use and discuss possible advantages of <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> in patients who have experienced <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> from other antiinflammatory agents .
<START:Chemical> All - trans - retinoic acid <END> - induced <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> in patients with <START:Disease> acute promyelocytic leukemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Erythema nodosum <END> associated with <START:Chemical> all - trans - retinoic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> ) for <START:Disease> acute promyelocytic leukemia <END> ( <START:Disease> APL <END> ) is very rare .
We describe four patients with classic <START:Disease> APL <END> who developed <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> during <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Fever <END> and subsequent multiple <START:Disease> painful <END> <START:Disease> erythematous nodules <END> over extremities developed on D 11 , D 16 , D 17 , and D 19 , respectively , after <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> therapy .
The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> .
All patients received short course of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
<START:Disease> Fever <END> subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely .
All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> .
<START:Chemical> ATRA <END> seemed to be the most possible etiology of <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> in our patients .
Short - term use of <START:Chemical> steroid <END> is very effective in <START:Chemical> ATRA <END> - induced <START:Disease> erythema nodosum <END> .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> induced by <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> on the second day of treatment .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NMS <END> ) is the rarest and most serious of the neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
We describe a case of <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NMS <END> ) associated with the use of <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> .
Although conventional neuroleptics are more frequently associated with <START:Disease> NMS <END> , atypical antipsychotic drugs like <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> may also be a cause .
The patient is a 24 - year - old male with a history of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> who developed signs and symptoms of <START:Disease> NMS <END> after 2 days of treatment with an 80 - mg / day dose of orally administrated <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> .
This case is the earliest ( second day of treatment ) <START:Disease> NMS <END> due to <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> reported in the literature .
<START:Chemical> Hydrocortisone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in humans : pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function .
Oral <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjects .
We studied the effects of 1 week of oral <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> ( 200 mg / day ) on blood pressure , cardiac output , total peripheral resistance , forearm vascular resistance , and <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> spillover to plasma in eight healthy male volunteers .
Although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged , systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm Hg ( SED + / - 3 . 4 , p less than 0 . 01 ) , associated with an <START:Disease> increased cardiac output <END> ( 5 . 85 - 7 . 73 l / min , SED + / - 0 . 46 , p less than 0 . 01 ) .
Total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15 . 1 to 12 . 2 mm Hg / l / min ( SED + / - 1 . 03 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
Resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged , but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated , the rise in resistance increasing from 10 . 5 mm Hg / ml / 100 ml / min ( R units ) before treatment to 32 . 6 R units after treatment ( SED + / - 6 . 4 , p less than 0 . 025 ) .
The rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra - arterial <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ( 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / min ) was also significantly greater after <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> , increasing from an average of 14 . 9 + / - 2 . 4 R units before treatment to 35 . 1 + / - 5 . 5 R units after <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> ( SED + / - 6 . 0 , p less than 0 . 05 ) .
A shift to the left in the dose - response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> after treatment .
Measurement of resting <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> spillover rate to plasma and <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not increased .
The <START:Disease> rise in resting blood pressure <END> with <START:Chemical> hydrocortisone <END> is associated with an <START:Disease> increased cardiac output <END> ( presumably due to increased blood volume ) . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Disease> Leg and back pain <END> after spinal anaesthesia involving hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
Fifty - four patients , aged 27 - 90 years , who were given <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> 5 % in 6 . 8 % <START:Chemical> glucose <END> solution for spinal anaesthesia were studied .
Thirteen of these patients experienced <START:Disease> pain in the legs and / or back <END> after recovery from anaesthesia .
The patients affected were younger ( p < 0 . 05 ) and the site of the dural puncture was higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) than those individuals without <START:Disease> pain <END> .
Five of the 13 patients ( 38 % ) with <START:Disease> pain <END> and seven of the 41 patients ( 17 % ) without <START:Disease> pain <END> admitted to a high <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> intake , which might be a contributing factor .
<START:Disease> Leg and / or back pain <END> is associated with the intrathecal use of hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
Iatrogenic risks of <START:Disease> endometrial carcinoma <END> after treatment for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> in a large French case - control study .
F d ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer ( FNCLCC ) .
Since <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> is widely used in <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined .
We have investigated the association between <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> and <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> use or other treatments in women treated for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> in a case - control study .
Cases of <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> diagnosed after <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> ( n = 135 ) and 467 controls matched for age , year of diagnosis of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included .
Women who had received <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> were significantly more likely to have <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> diagnosed than those who had not ( crude relative risk = 4 . 9 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment ( p = 0 . 0001 ) or the cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> received ( p = 0 . 0001 ) , irrespective of the daily dose .
Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk ( crude relative risk = 7 . 8 , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
After adjusting for confounding factors , the risk was higher for <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> users ( p = 0 . 0012 ) , treatment for more than 3 years ( all p < 0 . 03 ) and pelvic radiotherapy ( p = 0 . 012 ) .
Women who had <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> and had received <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> had more <START:Disease> advanced disease <END> and poorer prognosis than those with <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> who had not received this treatment .
Our results suggest a causal role of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> in <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> , particularly when used as currently proposed for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> prevention .
Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
<START:Disease> Endometrial cancers <END> diagnosed in women treated with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> have poorer prognosis .
Women who receive <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment .
A long - term evaluation of the risk - benefit ratio of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> as a preventive treatment for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> is clearly warranted .
<START:Chemical> Nitric oxide <END> synthase expression in the course of <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
We recently showed elevated reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species ( ROS ) , reduced urinary excretion of <START:Chemical> NO <END> metabolites ( NOx ) , and increased <START:Chemical> NO <END> sequestration as <START:Chemical> nitrotyrosine <END> in various tissues in rats with <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> is , in part , due to depressed <START:Chemical> NO <END> synthase ( NOS ) expression .
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a <START:Chemical> lead <END> - treated group ( given <START:Chemical> lead acetate <END> , 100 ppm , in drinking water and regular rat chow ) , a group given <START:Chemical> lead <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> - fortified chow , or a normal control group given either regular food and water or <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> - fortified food for 12 weeks .
Tail blood pressure , urinary NOx excretion , plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> ( <START:Chemical> MDA <END> ) , and endothelial and inducible NOS ( eNOS and iNOS ) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured .
The <START:Chemical> lead <END> - treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma <START:Chemical> MDA <END> concentration , a fall in urinary NOx excretion , and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin E <END> supplementation ameliorated <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , lowered plasma <START:Chemical> MDA <END> concentration , and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular , but not renal , tissue eNOS and iNOS expression .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin E <END> supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure , plasma <START:Chemical> MDA <END> , or NOS expression in the control group .
The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by <START:Chemical> lead <END> in cell - free preparations .
In conclusion , <START:Chemical> lead <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression .
This is , in part , due to ROS - mediated <START:Chemical> NO <END> inactivation , <START:Chemical> lead <END> - associated inhibition of NOS activity , and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
Exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout ( VIP - / - ) mice with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CYP <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( VIP ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition pathways .
VIP ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> CYP <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
Given VIP ' s role as an anti - inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that VIP ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after <START:Disease> cystitis <END> .
A mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor RT 2 profiler array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( WT ) and VIP ( - / - ) mice with or without <START:Chemical> CYP <END> - induced <START:Disease> cystitis <END> ( 150 mg / kg ; i . p . ; 48 h ) .
Four binary comparisons were made : WT control versus <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) , VIP ( - / - ) control versus <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) , WT control versus VIP ( - / - ) control , and WT with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) versus VIP ( - / - ) with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment ( 48 h ) .
The genes presented represent ( 1 ) greater than 1 . 5 - fold change in either direction and ( 2 ) the p value is less than 0 . 05 for the comparison being made .
Several regulated genes were validated using enzyme - linked immunoassays including IL - 1 beta and CXCL 1 .
<START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) increased expression of CXCL 1 and IL - 1 beta in the urinary bladder of WT and VIP ( - / - ) mice , but expression in VIP ( - / - ) mice with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> treatment was significantly ( p < or = 0 . 001 ) greater ( 4 . 2 - to 13 - fold increase ) than that observed in WT urinary bladder ( 3 . 6 - to 5 - fold increase ) .
The data suggest that in VIP ( - / - ) mice with <START:Disease> bladder inflammation <END> , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in WT with <START:Chemical> CYP <END> .
This shift in balance may contribute to increased <START:Disease> bladder dysfunction <END> in VIP ( - / - ) mice with <START:Disease> bladder inflammation <END> and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways .
Conversion to <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients : report of an initial experience .
BACKGROUND : The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> conversion in patients undergoing <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CsA <END> ) or <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> Tac <END> ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
METHODS : Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> ) ( 5 mg / day ) 0 to 204 months posttransplant .
Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses .
The indications for switch were chronic <START:Chemical> CsA <END> or <START:Chemical> Tac <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 12 ) , acute <START:Chemical> CsA <END> or <START:Chemical> Tac <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ( 3 ) , severe <START:Disease> facial dysmorphism <END> ( 2 ) , <START:Disease> posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder <END> ( <START:Disease> PTLD <END> ) in remission ( 2 ) , and <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in 1 . Follow - up is 7 to 24 months .
RESULTS : In the 12 patients switched because of chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> there was a significant decrease in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> [ 233 + / - 34 to 210 + / - 56 micromol / liter ( P < 0 . 05 ) at 6 months ] .
<START:Disease> Facial dysmorphism <END> improved in two patients .
No relapse of <START:Disease> PTLD <END> was observed .
Five patients developed <START:Disease> pneumonia <END> ( two <START:Disease> Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia <END> , one <START:Disease> infectious mononucleosis <END> with polyclonal <START:Disease> PTLD <END> lung infiltrate ) and two had <START:Disease> bronchiolitis obliterans <END> .
There were no deaths .
<START:Chemical> RAPA <END> was discontinued in four patients , because of <START:Disease> pneumonia <END> in two , <START:Disease> PTLD <END> in one , and oral <START:Disease> aphtous ulcers <END> in one .
<START:Chemical> RAPA <END> levels were high ( > 15 ng / ml ) in 7 of 13 ( 54 % ) patients .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable <START:Chemical> CsA <END> withdrawal .
However , when converting patients to <START:Chemical> RAPA <END> drug levels should be monitored to avoid over - immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and <START:Disease> Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia <END> prophylaxis should be given .
<START:Disease> Syncope <END> and <START:Disease> QT prolongation <END> among patients treated with <START:Chemical> methadone <END> for <START:Chemical> heroin <END> dependence in the city of Copenhagen .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Methadone <END> is prescribed to <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts to decrease illicit opioid use .
Prolongation of the QT interval in the ECG of patients with <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> ( <START:Disease> TdP <END> ) has been reported in <START:Chemical> methadone <END> users .
As <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts sometimes faint while using illicit drugs , doctors might attribute too many episodes of <START:Disease> syncope <END> to illicit drug use and thereby underestimate the incidence of <START:Disease> TdP <END> in this special population , and the high mortality in this population may , in part , be caused by the proarrhythmic effect of <START:Chemical> methadone <END> .
METHODS : In this cross - sectional study interview , ECGs and blood samples were collected in a population of adult <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts treated with <START:Chemical> methadone <END> or <START:Chemical> buprenorphine <END> on a daily basis .
Of the patients at the Drug Addiction Service in the municipal of Copenhagen , 450 ( approximately 52 % ) were included .
The QT interval was estimated from 12 lead ECGs .
All participants were interviewed about any experience of <START:Disease> syncope <END> .
The association between opioid dose and QT , and <START:Chemical> methadone <END> dose and reporting of <START:Disease> syncope <END> was assessed using multivariate linear regression and logistic regression , respectively .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Methadone <END> dose was associated with longer QT interval of 0 . 140 ms / mg ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
No association between <START:Chemical> buprenorphine <END> and QTc was found .
Among the subjects treated with <START:Chemical> methadone <END> , 28 % men and 32 % women had <START:Disease> prolonged QTc interval <END> .
None of the subjects treated with <START:Chemical> buprenorphine <END> had QTc interval > 0 . 440 s (( 1 / 2 )) .
A 50 mg higher <START:Chemical> methadone <END> dose was associated with a 1 . 2 ( 95 % CI 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 ) times higher odds for <START:Disease> syncope <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Methadone <END> is associated with <START:Disease> QT prolongation <END> and higher reporting of <START:Disease> syncope <END> in a population of <START:Chemical> heroin <END> addicts .
<START:Chemical> Prednisolone <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle dysfunction <END> is caused more by <START:Disease> atrophy <END> than by altered <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor expression .
Large doses of glucocorticoids can alter muscle physiology and susceptibility to neuromuscular blocking drugs by mechanisms not clearly understood .
We investigated the effects of moderate and large doses of <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> on muscle function and pharmacology , and their relationship to changes in muscle size and <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor ( AChR ) expression .
With institutional approval , 35 Sprague - Dawley rats were randomly allocated to receive daily subcutaneous doses of 10 mg / kg <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> ( P 10 group ) , 100 mg / kg <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> ( P 100 group ) , or an equal volume of saline ( S group ) for 7 days .
A fourth group of rats was pair fed ( food restricted ) with the P 100 rats for 7 days ( FR group ) .
On Day 8 , the nerve - evoked peak twitch tensions , <START:Disease> tetanic <END> tensions , and fatigability , and the dose - response curves of <START:Chemical> d - tubocurarine <END> in the tibialis cranialis muscle were measured in vivo and related to muscle mass or expression of AChRs .
Rate of body weight gain was depressed in the P 100 , FR , and P 10 groups compared with the S group .
Tibialis muscle mass was smaller in the P 100 group than in the P 10 or S groups .
The evoked peak twitch and <START:Disease> tetanic <END> tensions were less in the P 100 group than in the P 10 or S groups , however , tension per milligram of muscle mass was greater in the P 100 group than in the S group .
The 50 % effective dose of <START:Chemical> d - tubocurarine <END> ( microg / kg ) in the tibialis muscle was smaller in the P 10 ( 33 . 6 + / - 5 . 4 ) than in the S ( 61 . 9 + / - 5 . 0 ) or the P 100 ( 71 . 3 + / - 9 . 6 ) groups .
AChR expression was less in the P 10 group than in the S group .
The evoked tensions correlated with muscle mass ( r ( 2 ) = 0 . 32 , P < 0 . 001 ) , however , not with expression of AChR .
The 50 % effective dose of <START:Chemical> d - tubocurarine <END> did not correlate with muscle mass or AChR expression .
Our results suggest that the <START:Disease> neuromuscular dysfunction <END> after <START:Chemical> prednisolone <END> is dose - dependent , and derives primarily from <START:Disease> muscle atrophy <END> and derives less so from changes in AChR expression .
IMPLICATIONS : The mechanisms by which chronic glucocorticoid therapy alters neuromuscular physiology and pharmacology are unclear .
We suggest that the observed effects are dose - dependent and derive primarily from <START:Disease> muscle atrophy <END> and derive less from changes in <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> receptor expression .
Effects of <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> on the isolated perfused rat kidney .
Although <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> has been associated with the development of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains unclear .
The direct <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects of a single dose of 15 mg of <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> were compared in the recirculating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell - free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg / dL of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> .
There were no significant differences in renal <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion , <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> compared with the drug - free control groups .
In contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> to the kidney perfused with <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> ; no changes were found with <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> in the absence of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> .
A significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> was found in rats given <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> , compared with drug - free controls .
However , the fractional excretion of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period .
In summary , <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> causes <START:Disease> acute declines in renal function <END> , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Atorvastatin <END> prevented and reversed <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in the rat .
To assess the antioxidant effects of <START:Chemical> atorvastatin <END> ( <START:Chemical> atorva <END> ) on <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> ( <START:Chemical> dex <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , 60 male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated with <START:Chemical> atorva <END> 30 mg / kg / day or tap water for 15 days .
<START:Chemical> Dex <END> increased systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) from 109 + / - 1 . 8 to 135 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg and plasma <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> ( 5711 + / - 284 . 9 saline , 7931 + / - 392 . 8 U / ml <START:Chemical> dex <END> , P < 0 . 001 ) .
In this prevention study , SBP in the <START:Chemical> atorva <END> + <START:Chemical> dex <END> group was increased from 115 + / - 0 . 4 to 124 + / - 1 . 5 mmHg , but this was significantly lower than in the <START:Chemical> dex <END> - only group ( P ' < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Atorva <END> reversed <START:Chemical> dex <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> ( 129 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg , vs . 135 + / - 0 . 6 mmHg P ' < 0 . 05 ) and decreased plasma <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> ( 7931 + / - 392 . 8 <START:Chemical> dex <END> , 1187 + / - 441 . 2 <START:Chemical> atorva <END> + <START:Chemical> dex <END> , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Plasma <START:Chemical> nitrate <END> / <START:Chemical> nitrite <END> ( NOx ) was decreased in <START:Chemical> dex <END> - treated rats compared to saline - treated rats ( 11 . 2 + / - 1 . 08 microm , 15 . 3 + / - 1 . 17 microm , respectively , P < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Atorva <END> affected neither plasma NOx nor thymus weight .
Thus , <START:Chemical> atorvastatin <END> prevented and reversed <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in the rat .
Effect of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> on pre - existing and <START:Chemical> aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> is a side effect of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> treatment in <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> patients .
The possibility of reproducing the same <START:Disease> renal abnormality <END> with <START:Chemical> captopril <END> was examined in SHR .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> at 100 mg / kg for 14 days failed to aggravate <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> pre - existing in SHR .
Also , <START:Chemical> captopril <END> treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> invoked by <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> in SHR .
<START:Chemical> Captopril <END> had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations , excretion of urine , <START:Chemical> sodium <END> and <START:Chemical> potassium <END> , endogenous <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance , body weight , and food and water consumption .
However , <START:Chemical> ketone <END> bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of <START:Chemical> captopril <END> in SHR .
<START:Chemical> Glyceryl trinitrate <END> induces attacks of <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> in sufferers of <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
<START:Disease> Migraine with aura <END> and <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> have the same <START:Disease> pain <END> phase , thus indicating that <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> and <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> share a common pathway of nociception .
In recent years , increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) is involved in <START:Disease> pain <END> mechanisms of <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> .
In order to clarify whether the same is true for <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> , in the present study we examined the <START:Disease> headache <END> response to intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> GTN <END> ) ( 0 . 5 microg / kg / min for 20 min ) in 12 sufferers of <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and / or an attack of <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> could be induced .
Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls .
Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject .
<START:Disease> Headache <END> was more severe in <START:Disease> migraineurs <END> than in the controls during and immediately after <START:Chemical> GTN <END> infusion ( p = 0 . 037 ) as well as during the following 11 h ( p = 0 . 008 ) .
In the controls , the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> - induced <START:Disease> headache <END> gradually disappeared , whereas in <START:Disease> migraineurs <END> peak <START:Disease> headache <END> intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post - infusion .
At this time the induced <START:Disease> headache <END> in 6 of 12 <START:Disease> migraineurs <END> fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for <START:Disease> migraine without aura <END> of the International <START:Disease> Headache <END> Society .
The results therefore suggest that <START:Chemical> NO <END> is involved in the <START:Disease> pain <END> mechanisms of <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
Since cortical spreading <START:Disease> depression <END> has been shown to liberate <START:Chemical> NO <END> in animals , this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading <START:Disease> depression <END> and <START:Disease> headache <END> in <START:Disease> migraine with aura <END> .
Amelioration of <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> by <START:Chemical> timolol <END> .
The beta adrenergic blocking drug , <START:Chemical> timolol <END> , tended to correct the <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> of short - term <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was significant .
<START:Chemical> Timolol <END> also reduced the rise in plasma <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> and urine <START:Chemical> potassium <END> excretion following <START:Chemical> bendrofluazide <END> and increased the urine <START:Chemical> sodium <END> / <START:Chemical> potassium <END> ratio .
There was no evidence of a shift of <START:Chemical> potassium <END> from the intracellular to the extracellular space .
Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and <START:Disease> hepatoma <END> of mice induced by <START:Chemical> alpha - benzene hexachloride <END> .
Peroxisomes in <START:Disease> hepatomas <END> and hyperplastic preneoplastic <START:Disease> liver lesions <END> induced in mice by 500 ppm <START:Chemical> alpha - benzene hexachloride <END> were examined histochemically and electron microscopically .
Although most of the <START:Disease> hepatomas <END> were well - differentiated <START:Disease> tumors <END> and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes , the <START:Disease> tumor <END> cells did not respond to <START:Chemical> ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate <END> with proliferation of peroxisomes .
At the 16 th week of carcinogen feeding , hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages .
A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes .
Within the nodules , foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared .
These cells proliferated further , replacing the most part of the nodules , and with this process <START:Disease> hepatomas <END> appeared to have been formed .
No abnormal matrical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by <START:Chemical> ethyl - alpha - p - chlorophenoxyisobutyrate <END> unlike in the case of rats .
Involvement of the mu - opiate receptor in peripheral <START:Disease> analgesia <END> .
The intradermal injection of mu ( <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , <START:Chemical> Tyr - D - Ala - Gly - NMe - Phe - Gly - ol <END> and <START:Chemical> morphiceptin <END> ) , kappa ( <START:Chemical> trans - 3 , 4 - dichloro - N - methyl - N [ 2 - ( 1 - pyrrolidinyl ) cyclohexyl ] benzeneactemide <END> ) and delta ( <START:Chemical> [ D - Pen 2 . 5 ] - enkephalin <END>
and <START:Chemical> [ D - Ser 2 ] - [ Leu ] enkephalin - Thr <END> ) selective opioid - agonists , by themselves , did not significantly affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in the hindpaw of the rat .
Intradermal injection of mu , but not delta or kappa opioid - agonists , however , produced dose - dependent inhibition of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
The analgesic effect of the mu - agonist <START:Chemical> morphine <END> was dose - dependently antagonized by <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> and prevented by co - injection of pertussis toxin .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> did not , however , alter the <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> 8 - bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate <END> .
We conclude that the analgesic action of opioids on the peripheral terminals of primary afferents is via a binding site with characteristics of the mu - opioid receptor and that this action is mediated by inhibition of the <START:Chemical> cyclic adenosine monophosphate <END> second messenger system .
Absence of effect of <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> on time - based sensitization of <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
This double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study evaluated the effects of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> alone and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> plus <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects .
METHOD : All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> 2 mg on Days 2 and 25 .
From Days 9 to 25 , subjects were randomly assigned to either <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> ( 12 subjects ) or placebo ( 12 subjects ) ; the <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg / day from Days 9 to 16 , and remained at 200 mg / day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period .
Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24 - hour period after dosing on Days 1 , 2 , and 25 .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Impairment of cognitive function <END> was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing .
When single - dose <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> was given again 25 days later , greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups , suggesting enhancement of this effect .
There was no indication that <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> exacerbated the impairment produced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group .
Three subjects ( 2 on <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> and 1 on placebo ) withdrew from the study because of side effects .
Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment .
The side effect profiles of <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> and of placebo were similar .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> produced a clear profile of <START:Disease> cognitive impairment <END> that was not worsened by concomitant <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> administration .
<START:Disease> Structural and functional impairment of mitochondria <END> in <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in mice : suppression of cytochrome c oxidase II gene expression .
The use of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ) in <START:Disease> cancer <END> chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicity <END> .
Earlier observations that <START:Chemical> ADR <END> interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( COX ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate <START:Chemical> ADR <END> ' s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in Balb - c mice i . p . treated with <START:Chemical> ADR <END> for several weeks .
At various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscopy .
In parallel , total RNA was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization to determine the steady - state level of three RNA transcripts encoded by the COXII , COXIII , and COXIV genes .
Similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studies .
Our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with <START:Chemical> ADR <END> caused <START:Disease> cardiovascular arrhythmias <END> characterized by <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( tQRS ) , and failure of QRS at high concentrations ( 10 - 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent <START:Disease> swelling <END> , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial cristae after several weeks of treatment .
Such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of COX enzyme examined , only COXII gene expression was suppressed by <START:Chemical> ADR <END> treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and liver .
Knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of <START:Chemical> ADR <END> on cardiovascular function involve <START:Disease> mitochondrial structural and functional impairment <END> .
Coexistence of <START:Disease> cerebral venous sinus and internal carotid artery thrombosis <END> associated with exogenous sex hormones .
A case report .
A forty - six year - old premenopausal woman developed <START:Disease> headache <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> , left <START:Disease> hemiparesis <END> and <START:Disease> seizure <END> two days after parenteral use of <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> and <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> .
<START:Disease> Diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:Disease> DM <END> ) was found during admission .
Computed tomography showed a <START:Disease> hemorrhagic infarct <END> in the right frontal lobe and increased density in the superior sagittal sinus ( SSS ) .
Left carotid angiography found <START:Disease> occlusion of the left internal carotid artery <END> ( ICA ) .
Right carotid angiograms failed to show the SSS and inferior sagittal sinus , suggestive of <START:Disease> venous sinus thrombosis <END> .
Coexistence of the <START:Disease> cerebral artery and the venous sinus occlusion <END> has been described infrequently .
In this case , the authors postulate that the use of <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> and <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> and the underlying <START:Disease> DM <END> increased vascular thrombogenicity , which provided a common denominator for <START:Disease> thrombosis of both the ICA and the venous sinus <END> .
Does hormone therapy for the treatment of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> have a <START:Disease> detrimental effect on memory and cognition <END> ?
A pilot study .
This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> affects cognition .
Patients participating in a randomised trial of <START:Chemical> anastrozole <END> , <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> alone or combined ( ATAC ) ( n = 94 ) and a group of women without <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> ( n = 35 ) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures .
Compared with the control group , the patients were impaired on a processing speed task ( p = 0 . 032 ) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory ( p = 0 . 026 ) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups .
Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity .
The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in <START:Chemical> oestrogen <END> levels , a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women .
In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly .
<START:Disease> Torsade de pointes <END> induced by <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> in an elderly woman with preexisting complete <START:Disease> left bundle branch block <END> .
There is a growing list of drugs implicated in acquired <START:Disease> long QT syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
However , the torsadogenic potential of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> , a commonly used antiemetic and prokinetic drug , has not been reported in the literature , despite its chemical similarity to <START:Chemical> procainamide <END> .
We report on a 92 - year - old woman with preexisting complete <START:Disease> left bundle branch block <END> who developed <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> after intravenous and oral administration of <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> .
This patient also developed <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> when <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> and <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> were given simultaneously .
These two episodes were suppressed successfully after discontinuing the offending drugs and administering class IB drugs .
This is the first documentation that <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> provokes <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> clinically .
<START:Chemical> Metoclopramide <END> should be used cautiously in patients with a risk of <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
Lethal <START:Disease> anuria <END> complicating high dose <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> chemotherapy in a <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> patient with an <START:Disease> impaired renal function <END> .
A sixty - year - old woman with advanced <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , previously treated with <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> , developed an irreversible lethal <START:Disease> renal failure <END> with <START:Disease> anuria <END> , the day after 5 g / m 2 bolus <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> .
<START:Disease> Postrenal failure <END> was excluded by echography .
A prerenal component could have contributed to <START:Disease> renal failure <END> because of a transient <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , due to an increasing ascitis , occurring just before <START:Disease> anuria <END> .
However , correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function .
<START:Chemical> Ifosfamide <END> is a known <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> drug with demonstrated <START:Disease> tubulopathies <END> .
We strongly suspect that this lethal <START:Disease> anuria <END> was mainly due to <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> , occurring in a patient having received previous <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
We recommend careful use of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> in patients pretreated with <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion .
<START:Chemical> Glycopyrronium <END> requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> .
We have compared , in 60 adult patients , the cardiovascular effects of <START:Chemical> glycopyrronium <END> 5 micrograms kg - 1 and 10 micrograms kg - 1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> 1 mg kg - 1 .
Significant differences between the four groups were detected ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
Both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg - 1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min - 1 ( 95 % confidence limits 28 - 32 beat min - 1 ) .
Use of <START:Chemical> glycopyrronium <END> 5 micrograms kg - 1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and , given 1 min before the <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> , was sufficient to minimize early , <START:Chemical> edrophonium <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardias <END> .
This low dose of <START:Chemical> glycopyrronium <END> provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions .
<START:Chemical> Cefotetan <END> - induced immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
Immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> due to a drug - adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving <START:Chemical> penicillins <END> and first - generation <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> .
We describe a patient who developed <START:Disease> anemia <END> while receiving intravenous <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cefotetan <END> - dependent antibodies were detected in the patient ' s serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells .
The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> , suggesting the concomitant formation of warm - reactive autoantibodies .
These observations , in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular <START:Disease> hemolysis <END> , are consistent with drug - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , possibly involving both drug - adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms .
This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> therapy on <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in rats .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hypotension <END> is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit <START:Chemical> calcium <END> influx in some tissues .
This study addressed the potential role of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
METHODS : Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel blocker <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
<START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> .
Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> IP to produce <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , QRS prolongation , and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
Fifteen min later , animals received <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> , <START:Chemical> NaHCO 3 <END> , or saline .
In a second experiment , rats received tricyclic antidepressant <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> IP followed in 15 min by <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> or saline .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> NaHCO 3 <END> briefly ( 5 min ) reversed <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and QRS prolongation .
<START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> failed to improve blood pressure .
The incidence of <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> ( p = 0 . 004 ) and <START:Disease> seizures <END> ( p = 0 . 03 ) in the <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> group was higher than the other groups .
CONCLUSION : The administration of <START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> or <START:Chemical> 4 - aminopyridine <END> did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> CaCl 2 <END> therapy may possibly worsen both <START:Disease> cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity <END> .
These findings do not support a role for <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The renal pathology in a case of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes insipidus <END> .
A case of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes insipidus <END> is reported .
At necropsy microscopy shoed unique and extensive damage to cells lining the distal nephron .
It is suggested that these changes represent a specific toxic effect of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , reported here for the first time in man .
Effects of <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> on myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply and demand in patients with chronic <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
A hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic study in patients without <START:Disease> heart failure <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> digitalis glycosides <END> on myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , but have not been measured previously in man .
We assessed the effects of <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> ( 0 . 015 mg / kg body weight ) on hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> without clinical <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> .
Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations , we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> administration was omitted .
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell in each patient given <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> , even though they were initially elevated in only two patients .
Left ventricular end - diastolic pressure fell from 11 . 5 + / - 1 . 4 ( mean + / - SE ) to 5 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 mm Hg ( P less than 0 . 001 ) and left ventricular end - diastolic volume fell from 100 + / - 17 to 82 + / - 12 ml / m 2 ( P less than 0 . 01 ) 1 h after <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> infusion was completed .
The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1 . 68 + / - 0 . 11 ml / s to 2 . 18 + / - 0 . 21 muscle - lengths / s ( P less than 0 . 05 ) and is consistent with an increase in contractility .
No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients .
No significant change in myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption occurred after <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> patients than in the control patients .
We conclude that in patients with chronic <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> who are not in clinical <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> <START:Disease> left ventricular end - diastolic volume falls <END> after <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> administration even when it is initially normal .
Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption .
Nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism .
The hemodynamics of <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cases .
<START:Chemical> Oxytocin <END> is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , particularly when given as a bolus .
The resulting <START:Disease> hypotension <END> can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return .
Parturients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this <START:Disease> hypotension <END> with a compensatory increase in heart rate and <START:Disease> stroke <END> volume .
<START:Chemical> Oxytocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to <START:Disease> blood loss <END> .
Pulse power analysis ( also called " pulse contour analysis " ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure .
Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> in response to <START:Chemical> oxytocin <END> was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in <START:Disease> stroke <END> volume , heart rate and cardiac output .
Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating <START:Disease> hypotension <END> during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia .
Case report : <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> and polymorphic <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> revisited .
<START:Chemical> Pentamidine isethionate <END> has been associated with <START:Disease> ventricular tachyarrhythmias <END> , including <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
This article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to date .
<START:Chemical> Pentamidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> may be related to serum <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> levels and <START:Disease> hypomagnesemia <END> may synergistically induce torsade .
<START:Disease> Torsade de pointes <END> occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> .
In these patients , no other acute side effects of <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> were observed .
<START:Disease> Torsade de pointes <END> can be treated when recognized early , possibly without discontinuation of <START:Chemical> pentamidine <END> .
When <START:Disease> QTc interval prolongation <END> is observed , early <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> supplementation is advocated .
Rapid reversal of life - threatening <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> - induced <START:Disease> tetany <END> with <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> .
We describe a patient who developed <START:Disease> tetany <END> with sudden <START:Disease> respiratory arrest <END> after the infusion of intravenous <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> .
The administration of <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> rapidly resolved the patient ' s <START:Disease> tetany <END> with prompt recovery of respiratory function , averting the need for more aggressive airway management and ventilatory support .
The emergency physician should be aware that life - threatening <START:Disease> tetany <END> may accompany the administration of intravenous <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> and that <START:Chemical> calcium chloride <END> may be a rapid and effective remedy .
Reduction of <START:Disease> pain <END> during induction with target - controlled <START:Chemical> propofol <END> and <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Pain <END> on injection of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> is unpleasant .
We hypothesized that <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion <START:Disease> pain <END> might be prevented by infusing <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> before starting the <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion in a clinical setting where target - controlled infusions ( TCI ) of both drugs were used .
A prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was performed to determine the effect - site concentration ( Ce ) of <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> to prevent the <START:Disease> pain <END> without producing complications .
METHODS : A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline ( control ) or <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> to a target Ce of 2 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R 2 ) , 4 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R 4 ) , or 6 ng ml ( - 1 ) ( R 6 ) administered via TCI .
After the target Ce was achieved , the infusion of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> was started .
<START:Chemical> Remifentanil <END> - related complications were assessed during the <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> infusion , and <START:Disease> pain <END> caused by <START:Chemical> propofol <END> was evaluated using a four - point scale during the <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion .
RESULTS : The incidence of <START:Disease> pain <END> was significantly lower in Groups R 4 and R 6 than in the control and R 2 groups ( 12 / 32 and 6 / 31 vs 26 / 31 and 25 / 32 , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> was less severe in Groups R 4 and R 6 than in the control and R 2 groups ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
However , both incidence and severity of <START:Disease> pain <END> were not different between Groups R 4 and R 6 .
No significant complications were observed during the study .
CONCLUSIONS : During induction of anaesthesia with TCI of <START:Chemical> propofol <END> and <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> , a significant reduction in <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion <START:Disease> pain <END> was achieved without significant complications by prior administration of <START:Chemical> remifentanil <END> at a target Ce of 4 ng ml ( - 1 ) .
Consensus statement concerning <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of <START:Disease> autoimmune diseases <END> , with special reference to <START:Disease> systemic sclerosis <END> and <START:Disease> multiple sclerosis <END> .
Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe <START:Disease> autoimmune diseases <END> .
Worldwide , over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials .
The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials .
However , as predicted , significant transplant - related morbidity and mortality have been observed .
This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to <START:Disease> infections <END> .
The number of deaths related to <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> is low .
However , caution is required when <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> or <START:Chemical> anthracyclines <END> such as <START:Chemical> mitoxantrone <END> are used in patients with a possible underlying <START:Disease> heart damage <END> , for example , <START:Disease> systemic sclerosis <END> patients .
In November 2002 , a meeting was held in Florence , bringing together a number of experts in various fields , including rheumatology , cardiology , neurology , pharmacology and transplantation medicine .
The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data , both published or available , in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation <START:Disease> autoimmune disease <END> database , and to propose a safe approach to such patients .
A full cardiological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> associated with <START:Disease> sleep deprivation <END> and sustained - release <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> .
This case report describes a generalized <START:Disease> seizure <END> associated with sustained - release <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> use and <START:Disease> sleep deprivation <END> .
The subject , a 31 - year - old female smoker , was participating in a clinical trial evaluating an investigational medication for smoking cessation that used sustained - release <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> as an active control .
After 5 weeks of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> use , the subject experienced a generalized tonic clonic <START:Disease> seizure <END> after staying up nearly all night packing and moving to a new residence .
The patient had no other risk factors for <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
We suggest that <START:Disease> sleep deprivation <END> may add to the risk of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> - associated <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> responses in <START:Chemical> methadone <END> - maintained opioid abusers .
Providing <START:Disease> pain <END> management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task , in part because little is known about their <START:Disease> pain <END> experience and analgesic requirements .
This study was designed to describe <START:Disease> pain <END> tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of <START:Disease> opioid addicts <END> stabilized in <START:Chemical> methadone <END> - maintenance ( MM ) treatment ( n = 60 ) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) .
By using a placebo - controlled , two - way factorial design , tolerance to cold - pressor ( CP ) <START:Disease> pain <END> was examined , both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( <START:Chemical> hydromorphone <END> 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory ( <START:Chemical> ketorolac <END> 10 mg ) analgesic agents .
Results showed that MM individuals were significantly less tolerant of CP <START:Disease> pain <END> than control subjects , replicating previous work .
Analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor group .
These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a <START:Disease> pain - intolerant <END> subset of clinical patients .
Their complaints of <START:Disease> pain <END> should be evaluated seriously and managed aggressively .
<START:Chemical> Daidzein <END> activates <START:Chemical> choline <END> acetyltransferase from MC - IXC cells and improves drug - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
The <START:Chemical> choline <END> acetyltransferase ( ChAT ) activator , which enhances cholinergic transmission via an augmentation of the enzymatic production of <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> ACh <END> ) , is an important factor in the treatment of <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> AD <END> ) .
Methanolic extracts from Pueraria thunbergiana exhibited an activation effect ( 46 % ) on ChAT in vitro .
Via the sequential isolation of Pueraria thunbergiana , the active component was ultimately identified as <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> ( <START:Chemical> 4 ' , 7 - dihydroxy - isoflavone <END> ) .
In order to investigate the effects of <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> from Pueraria thunbergiana on <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> impairments of learning and memory <END> , we conducted a series of in vivo tests .
Administration of <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> ( 4 . 5 mg / kg body weight ) to mice was shown significantly to reverse <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , according to the results of a Y - maze test .
Injections of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> into mice resulted in impaired performance on Y - maze tests ( a 37 % decreases in alternation behavior ) .
By way of contrast , mice treated with <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> prior to the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> injections were noticeably protected from this performance impairment ( an approximately 12 % - 21 % decrease in alternation behavior ) .
These results indicate that <START:Chemical> daidzein <END> might play a role in <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> biosynthesis as a ChAT activator , and that it also ameliorates <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
<START:Disease> Hepatonecrosis <END> and <START:Disease> cholangitis <END> related to long - term <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> therapy : an autopsy report of two patients .
<START:Chemical> Phenobarbital <END> ( <START:Chemical> PB <END> ) has a reputation for safety , and it is commonly believed that <START:Chemical> PB <END> - related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic <START:Disease> liver disease <END> .
Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> treated with <START:Chemical> PB <END> who died suddenly : one as consequence of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> , the other of acute <START:Disease> bronchopneumonia <END> .
At autopsy , analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate , which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells , associated with several foci of <START:Disease> necrosis <END> surrounded by a hard ring of non - specific granulomatous tissue .
Inflammatory reactions of internal and external hepatic biliary ducts were also seen .
Our findings illustrate that <START:Chemical> PB <END> may be associated with chronic <START:Disease> liver damage <END> , which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences .
For this reason , each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of <START:Chemical> PB <END> - related asymptomatic <START:Disease> chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> mycophenolate mofetil <END> for calcineurin - free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
Calcineurin inhibitors , such as <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> , have been available for almost 20 years .
Although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression , they are associated with acute and chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> may eventually result in graft loss .
Acute and chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation increases .
Two recently available immunosuppressive agents , <START:Chemical> mycophenolate mofetil <END> and <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> ( <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ) , have no <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
The use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therapy .
This paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
In vivo characterization of a dual <START:Chemical> adenosine A 2 A / A 1 receptor antagonist <END> in animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
The in vivo characterization of a dual <START:Chemical> adenosine A ( 2 A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist <END> in several animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> is described .
Discovery and scale - up syntheses of compound 1 are described in detail , highlighting optimization steps that increased the overall yield of 1 from 10 . 0 % to 30 . 5 % .
Compound 1 is a potent A ( 2 A ) / A ( 1 ) receptor antagonist in vitro ( A ( 2 A ) K ( i ) = 4 . 1 nM ; A ( 1 ) K ( i ) = 17 . 0 nM ) that has excellent activity , after oral administration , across a number of animal models of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> including mouse and rat models of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , mouse model of <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> akinesia <END> , rat <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - OHDA <END> ) lesion model of drug - induced rotation , and <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - treated non - human primate model .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> in a neonate .
The clinical and autopsy findings in a premature baby who died of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> after therapy with <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ( 5 mg / kg / day ) and <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> are presented .
The serum <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> concentration had reached toxic levels when <START:Disease> anuria <END> developed .
Numerous <START:Chemical> periodic acid <END> Schiff ( PAS ) positive , diastase resistant cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which appeared as myelin figures in cytosegresomes under the electron microscope were identified in the proximal convoluted tubules .
The pathological changes induced by <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> in the human neonatal kidneys have not been previously reported .
A case of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> related to <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> pretreatment .
Suboptimal <START:Disease> seizure <END> duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice , especially in older patients with higher <START:Disease> seizure <END> thresholds .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> is commonly used to improve <START:Disease> seizure <END> duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated aside from occasional reports of relatively benign <START:Disease> ventricular ectopy <END> .
We describe a patient with no previous history of <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> or <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> who developed sustained bigeminy and 2 brief runs of <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> after <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> administration .
Although intravenous <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> is generally well tolerated , the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
<START:Chemical> Carbamazepine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> .
Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes .
A patient with sinus <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and <START:Disease> atrioventricular block <END> , induced by <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> , prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases .
From the analysis of these cases , two distinct forms of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> - associated <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> emerged .
One patient group developed <START:Disease> sinus tachycardias <END> in the setting of a massive <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life - threatening <START:Disease> bradyarrhythmias <END> or <START:Disease> atrioventricular conduction delay <END> , associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> serum levels .
Because <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> conditions , the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients .
<START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> complicating bone marrow transplantation .
<START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> is a potentially serious complication of high - dose <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation .
As standard practice at our institution , patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation .
In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation , we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> , which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> that causes <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis , 4 had symptomatic <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
In contrast , two of four consecutive patients who received <START:Chemical> mesna <END> uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> for at least 2 weeks .
Because of this suboptimal result , we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
Does supplemental <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> increase <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> risk in women with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> ?
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> acts as a potent antioxidant ; however , it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro .
These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> in <START:Disease> diabetic <END> persons might promote <START:Disease> atherosclerosis <END> .
OBJECTIVE : The objective was to examine the relation between <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake and mortality from <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> .
DESIGN : We studied the relation between <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake and mortality from total <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> ( n = 281 ) , <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> ( n = 175 ) , and <START:Disease> stroke <END> ( n = 57 ) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being <START:Disease> diabetic <END> at baseline .
Diet was assessed with a food - frequency questionnaire at baseline , and subjects initially free of <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> were prospectively followed for 15 y .
RESULTS : After adjustment for <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> risk factors , type of <START:Disease> diabetes <END> medication used , duration of <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , and intakes of <START:Chemical> folate <END> , <START:Chemical> vitamin E <END> , and <START:Chemical> beta - carotene <END> , the adjusted relative risks of total <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> mortality were 1 . 0 , 0 . 97 , 1 . 11 , 1 . 47 , and 1 . 84 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) across quintiles of total <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake from food and supplements .
Adjusted relative risks of <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> were 1 . 0 , 0 . 81 , 0 . 99 , 1 . 26 , and 1 . 91 ( P for trend = 0 . 01 ) and of <START:Disease> stroke <END> were 1 . 0 , 0 . 52 , 1 . 23 , 2 . 22 , and 2 . 57 ( P for trend < 0 . 01 ) .
When dietary and supplemental <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> were analyzed separately , only supplemental <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> showed a positive association with mortality endpoints .
<START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> intake was unrelated to mortality from <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline .
CONCLUSION : A high <START:Chemical> vitamin C <END> intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> mortality in postmenopausal women with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> .
<START:Disease> Bradycardia <END> due to <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride <END> .
A chronic <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patient was treated with an anticholinergic drug , <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride <END> .
The patient developed , paradoxically , sinus <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
The reaction was specific to <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> and not to other anticholinergic drugs .
This antidyskinetic drug is widely used in clinical <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> practice and physicians should be aware of this side effect .
Arterial <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> in patients receiving systemic <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy : a complication associated with <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
Arterial <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> is a recognized complication of systemic <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy .
Characteristic of the entity is <START:Disease> arterial occlusion <END> by platelet - fibrin <START:Disease> thrombi <END> with distal <START:Disease> ischemia <END> occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy , preceded by profound <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> with platelet counts in the range of 30 , 000 to 40 , 000 per cubic millimeter .
The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by <START:Disease> gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms <END> that appear to be <START:Disease> ischemic <END> in origin , and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications .
Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> are reviewed .
The common factor relating <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> is <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> .
Appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , and anticoagulation with <START:Chemical> sodium warfarin <END> if necessary .
Vascular procedures are performed as indicated .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin E 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> bladder hyperactivity <END> in normal , conscious rats : involvement of <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> ?
In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry , intravesically instilled <START:Chemical> prostaglandin ( PG ) E 2 <END> facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure .
The effect was attenuated by both the NK 1 receptor selective antagonist <START:Chemical> RP 67 , 580 <END> and the NK 2 receptor selective antagonist <START:Chemical> SR 48 , 968 <END> , given intra - arterially , suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK 1 and NK 2 receptors .
Intra - arterially given <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the <START:Chemical> PG <END> had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle .
The effect of intra - arterial <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> could not be blocked by intra - arterial <START:Chemical> RP 67 , 580 <END> or <START:Chemical> SR 48 , 968 <END> , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra - arterial <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the <START:Chemical> PG <END> was given intravesically .
The present results thus suggest that intra - arterial <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor .
However , when given intravesically , <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> may stimulate micturition by releasing <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> from nerves in and / or immediately below the urothelium .
These <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating NK 1 and NK 2 receptors .
<START:Chemical> Prostanoids <END> may , via release of <START:Chemical> tachykinins <END> , contribute to both urge and <START:Disease> bladder hyperactivity <END> seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract .
Reversal of central <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> effects by <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> after intravenous conscious sedation with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> and opioids : report of a double - blind multicenter study .
The <START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> in Intravenous Conscious Sedation with <START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> Multicenter Study Group II .
The efficacy and safety of a new <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> antagonist , <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> , were assessed in a double - blind multicenter study .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> ( mean dose , 0 . 76 mg ) or placebo ( mean dose , 8 . 9 ml ) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients , respectively , who had been given <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> in conjunction with an opioid ( <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> , <START:Chemical> meperidine <END> , or <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical procedures .
The group assessable for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> and 64 patients given placebo .
After 5 minutes , 80 / 115 ( 70 % ) <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> - treated patients , compared with 21 / 63 ( 33 % ) placebo - treated patients , were completely awake and alert , as indicated by a score of 5 on the Observer ' s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale .
Ninety - five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5 - minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180 - minute assessment period .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> - treated patients also performed significantly better on the Finger - to - Nose Test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5 - minute assessment .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> was well tolerated , with no serious adverse effects reported .
Thirty - nine ( 30 % ) of <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> - treated patients , compared with 17 ( 25 % ) of placebo - treated patients had one or more drug - related adverse experiences .
The most common adverse effects were <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> in the <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> group and <START:Disease> nausea <END> and injection - site <START:Disease> pain <END> in the placebo group .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> in the presence of opioids .
Reversible <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> with <START:Disease> bile duct injury <END> following <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> therapy .
A case report .
A 67 - year - old patient , with primary <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> and without previous evidence of <START:Disease> liver disease <END> , developed clinical and biochemical features of severe <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> 3 months after initiation of <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> therapy .
Liver biopsy showed <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> with both cytological and architectural alterations of interlobular bile ducts .
<START:Chemical> Azathioprine <END> withdrawal resulted after 7 weeks in the resolution of clinical and biochemical abnormalities .
It is believed that this is the first reported case of reversible <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> associated with histological evidence of <START:Disease> bile duct injury <END> .
Severe immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> associated with prophylactic use of <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> in obstetric and gynecologic procedures .
Second - and third - generation <START:Chemical> cephalosporins <END> , especially <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> , are increasingly associated with severe , sometimes fatal immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
We noticed that 10 of our 35 cases of <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemolytic anemias <END> were in patients who had received <START:Chemical> cefotetan <END> prophylactically for obstetric and gynecologic procedures .
Eight of these cases of severe immune <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> are described .
Effect of <START:Chemical> alpha - tocopherol <END> and <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> on <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MA <END> ) - induced dopaminergic <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals .
This study examined the effect of <START:Chemical> alpha - tocopherol <END> ( <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> ) , a scavenger of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species , and <START:Chemical> deferoxamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ) , an <START:Chemical> iron <END> chelator , on the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Male rats were treated with <START:Chemical> MA <END> ( 10 mg / kg , every 2 h for four injections ) .
The rat received either <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> ( 20 mg / kg ) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to <START:Chemical> MA <END> administration or <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ( 50 mg / kg ) subcutaneously 30 min before <START:Chemical> MA <END> administration .
The concentrations of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) , <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> and their metabolites decreased significantly after <START:Chemical> MA <END> administration , which was inhibited by the <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> pretreatment .
<START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> attenuated the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity .
The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> concentration was lower in the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - treated rats .
These changes were significantly attenuated by <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> .
This suggests that <START:Chemical> alpha - TC <END> and <START:Chemical> DFO <END> ameliorate the <START:Chemical> MA <END> - induced <START:Disease> neuronal damage <END> by decreasing the level of oxidative stress .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> causes alterations in the MAP kinase - related pathways in the brains of mice that display increased <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> .
<START:Disease> Aggressive behaviors <END> have been reported in patients who suffer from some <START:Disease> psychiatric disorders <END> , and are common in <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) abusers .
Herein , we report that multiple ( but not single ) injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> significantly increased <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> in male CD - 1 mice .
This increase in <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> was not secondary to <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase - related pathways after multiple and single <START:Chemical> METH <END> injections .
There were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decreases in MEK 1 , Erk 2 p , GSK 3 alpha , 14 - 3 - 3 e , and MEK 7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
MEK 1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of <START:Chemical> METH <END> , but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
In the frontal cortex , there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK 3 alpha after multiple ( but not single ) injections of <START:Chemical> METH <END> .
These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase - related pathways in the prefronto - striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of <START:Disease> aggressive behaviors <END> in mice .
<START:Chemical> Chloroquine <END> related complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> with <START:Disease> blindness <END> : case report .
A 27 - year old African woman with history of regular <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> ingestion presented with progressive <START:Disease> deterioration of vision <END> , easy <START:Disease> fatiguability <END> , <START:Disease> dyspnoea <END> , <START:Disease> dizziness <END> progressing to <START:Disease> syncopal attacks <END> .
Ophthalmological assessment revealed features of <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> <START:Disease> retinopathy <END> , cardiac assessment revealed features of <START:Disease> heart failure <END> and a complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> with <START:Disease> right bundle branch block <END> pattern .
The <START:Disease> heart block <END> was treated by pacemaker insertion and the <START:Disease> heart failure <END> resolved spontaneously following <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> discontinuation .
She however remains <START:Disease> blind <END> .
Risk of <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> after consumption of nonionic <START:Chemical> contrast media <END> by children undergoing cardiac angiography : a prospective study .
Despite increasing reports on nonionic <START:Chemical> contrast media <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> ( <START:Disease> CIN <END> ) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures , the studies in pediatrics are limited , with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography .
This prospective study determined the incidence of <START:Disease> CIN <END> for two nonionic <START:Chemical> contrast media <END> ( <START:Chemical> CM <END> ) , <START:Chemical> iopromide <END> and <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> , among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of <START:Chemical> CM <END> and the presence of <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> .
The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either <START:Chemical> iopromide <END> ( group A , n = 40 ) or <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> ( group B , n = 40 ) .
Serum <START:Chemical> sodium <END> ( <START:Chemical> Na <END> ) , <START:Chemical> potassium <END> ( <START:Chemical> K <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Cr <END> ) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values , then measured again at 12 - , 24 - , and 48 - h intervals after <START:Chemical> CM <END> use .
Urine samples for <START:Chemical> Na <END> and <START:Chemical> Cr <END> also were checked at the same intervals .
Risk of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , <START:Disease> Injury to the kidney <END> , <START:Disease> Failure of kidney function <END> , <START:Disease> Loss of kidney function <END> , and End - stage <START:Disease> renal damage <END> ( RIFLE criteria ) were used to define <START:Disease> CIN <END> and its incidence in the study population .
Accordingly , among the 15 <START:Disease> CIN <END> patients ( 18 . 75 % ) , 7 . 5 % of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3 . 75 % had <START:Disease> renal injury <END> , whereas 5 % of group B had increased risk and 2 . 5 % had <START:Disease> renal injury <END> .
Whereas 33 . 3 % of the patients with <START:Disease> CIN <END> were among those who received the proper dosage of <START:Chemical> CM <END> , the percentage increased to 66 . 6 % among those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of <START:Disease> CIN <END> related to the different dosages of <START:Chemical> CM <END> ( p = 0 . 014 ) .
Among the 15 patients with <START:Disease> CIN <END> , 6 had cyanotic <START:Disease> congenital heart diseases <END> , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients ( p = 0 . 243 ) .
Although clinically silent , <START:Disease> CIN <END> is not rare in pediatrics .
The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic <START:Chemical> CM <END> , nor on the presence of <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> , and although <START:Disease> CIN <END> usually is reversible , more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children .
Assessment of perinatal <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> prevention practices in New Hampshire .
METHODS : Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother - infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire ' s 25 delivery hospitals .
Assessment was done on the following : prenatal screening for <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> , administration of the <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> vaccine birth dose to all infants , administration of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin to infants who were born to <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> - positive mothers , <START:Disease> rubella <END> immunity , and administration of in - hospital postpartum <START:Disease> rubella <END> vaccine to <START:Disease> rubella <END> nonimmune women .
RESULTS : Prenatal screening rates for <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> ( 98 . 8 % ) and <START:Disease> rubella <END> ( 99 . 4 % ) were high .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> vaccine birth dose was administered to 76 . 2 % of all infants .
All infants who were born to <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> - positive mothers also received <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin .
Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> vaccination .
The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 ( 48 . 5 % and 67 . 5 % , respectively ) was less than any other months , whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 ( 88 . 2 % ) was the highest .
Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of <START:Disease> rubella <END> nonimmunity ( 9 . 5 % ) .
In - hospital postpartum <START:Disease> rubella <END> vaccine administration was documented for 75 . 6 % of nonimmune women .
CONCLUSION : This study documents good compliance in New Hampshire ' s birthing hospitals with national guidelines for perinatal <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> and <START:Disease> rubella <END> prevention and highlights potential areas for improvement .
Expression of p 300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> is an anti - <START:Disease> tumor <END> agent that represses cardiac - specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> depletes cardiac p 300 , a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes .
However , the role of p 300 in protection against <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced apoptosis is unknown .
Transgenic mice overexpressing p 300 in the heart and wild - type mice were subjected to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> treatment .
Compared with wild - type mice , transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha - sarcomeric actin .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild - type mice but not in transgenic mice .
Expression of p 300 increased the cardiac level of bcl - 2 and mdm - 2 , but not that of p 53 or other members of the bcl - 2 family .
These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p 300 protects cardiac myocytes from <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute <START:Disease> heart failure <END> in adult mice in vivo .
<START:Chemical> Disulfiram <END> - induced transient <START:Disease> optic and peripheral neuropathy <END> : a case report .
AIM : To report a case of <START:Disease> optic and peripheral neuropathy <END> after chronic use of <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> for <START:Disease> alcohol dependence <END> management .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : A case report .
RESULTS : A 57 - year - old male presented with gradual <START:Disease> loss of vision <END> in both eyes with intermittent <START:Disease> headaches <END> for 2 months .
He also complained of <START:Disease> paraesthesia <END> with <START:Disease> numbness <END> in both feet .
His vision was 6 / 15 and 2 / 60 in the right and left eyes , respectively .
Fundoscopy revealed bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads .
Visual field testing confirmed bilateral central - caecal <START:Disease> scotomata <END> .
He had been taking <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> for <START:Disease> alcohol dependence <END> for the preceding 3 years .
<START:Chemical> Disulfiram <END> discontinuation lead to an immediate symptomatic improvement .
CONCLUSION : Physicians initiating long - term <START:Chemical> disulfiram <END> therapy should be aware of these adverse effects .
They should recommend annual ophthalmic reviews with visual field testing .
Patients should be reassured with respect to the reversibility of these adverse effects .
Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross - react with <START:Chemical> halothane <END> - induced antibodies .
Two halogenated anesthetics , <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> , have been associated with an allergic - type <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> both alone and following previous exposure to <START:Chemical> halothane <END> .
<START:Chemical> Halothane <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> appears to involve an aberrant immune response .
An antibody response to a protein - bound biotransformation product ( <START:Chemical> trifluoroacetyl <END> adduct ) has been detected on <START:Chemical> halothane <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> patients .
This study was performed to determine cross - reactivity between <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> with the <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> halothane <END> .
The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by <START:Chemical> halothane <END> - induced antibodies following <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> , and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models .
<START:Chemical> Enflurane <END> administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver .
In the same liver , biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20 - fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats .
This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which <START:Chemical> enflurane <END> and / or <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> could produce a <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> condition similar to that of <START:Chemical> halothane <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> either alone or subsequent to <START:Chemical> halothane <END> administration .
The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens .
Reduced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome - encapsulated <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> compared with conventional <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in a randomized , multicenter trial of metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
PURPOSE : To determine whether <START:Chemical> Myocet <END> ( liposome - encapsulated <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ; The Liposome Company , Elan Corporation , Princeton , NJ ) in combination with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> significantly reduces <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first - line treatment of metastatic <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> ( <START:Disease> MBC <END> ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Two hundred ninety - seven patients with <START:Disease> MBC <END> and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg / m ( 2 ) of <START:Chemical> Myocet <END> ( M ) or conventional <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( A ) , in combination with 600 mg / m ( 2 ) of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( C ) , every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxicity <END> was defined by reductions in left - ventricular ejection fraction , assessed by serial multigated radionuclide angiography scans , or <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) .
Antitumor efficacy was assessed by objective <START:Disease> tumor <END> response rates ( World Health Organization criteria ) , time to progression , and survival .
RESULTS : Six percent of MC patients versus 21 % ( including five cases of <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) of AC patients developed <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> ( P = . 0002 ) .
Median cumulative <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> dose at onset was more than 2 , 220 mg / m ( 2 ) for MC versus 480 mg / m ( 2 ) for AC ( P = . 0001 , hazard ratio , 5 . 04 ) .
MC patients also experienced less grade 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> .
Antitumor efficacy of MC versus AC was comparable : objective response rates , 43 % versus 43 % ; median time to progression , 5 . 1 % versus 5 . 5 months ; median time to treatment failure , 4 . 6 versus 4 . 4 months ; and median survival , 19 versus 16 months .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Myocet <END> improves the therapeutic index of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> by significantly reducing <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> and grade 4 <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> and provides comparable antitumor efficacy , when used in combination with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> as first - line therapy for <START:Disease> MBC <END> .
Protective effects of antithrombin on <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> in rats .
We investigated the effects of antithrombin , a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors , in rats with <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> , which is an experimental model of human <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Antithrombin ( 50 or 500 IU / kg / i . v . ) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( 50 mg / kg / i . v . ) .
Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hematological abnormalities <END> .
<START:Chemical> Puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> and <START:Disease> hyperlipidemia <END> were also suppressed .
Histopathological examination revealed severe <START:Disease> renal damage <END> such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats , while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin - treated rats .
In addition , antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased .
These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> - associated , benign transient <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> in <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patients with a past history of <START:Chemical> LSD <END> abuse .
Two <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> patients , who had a prior history of <START:Chemical> LSD <END> abuse and who had previously developed <START:Disease> EPS <END> with classic antipsychotics , were successfully treated with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
They both reported short episodes of transient <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> , which appeared immediately after starting treatment with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
This imagery resembled <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> previously experienced as " flashbacks " related to prior <START:Chemical> LSD <END> consumption .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> administration was continued and the <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> gradually wore off .
During a six - month follow - up period , there was no recurrence of <START:Disease> visual disturbances <END> .
This phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign , short - term and self - limiting side effect which does not contraindicate the use of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> or interfere with treatment .
Conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution .
A phase I clinical study of the <START:Chemical> antipurine <END> antifolate <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> ( <START:Chemical> DDATHF <END> ) given with oral <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lometrexol <END> is an antifolate which inhibits <START:Chemical> glycinamide ribonucleotide <END> formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , an enzyme essential for de novo <START:Chemical> purine <END> synthesis .
Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> has activity against <START:Disease> tumours <END> which are refractory to other drugs , notably <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> .
However , the initial clinical development of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative <START:Disease> toxicities <END> .
Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> can be prevented by low dose <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> administration , i . e . for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose .
This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> given with <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> supplementation which has confirmed that the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> can be markedly reduced by <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> supplementation .
<START:Disease> Thrombocytopenia <END> and <START:Disease> mucositis <END> were the major <START:Disease> toxicities <END> .
There was no clear relationship between clinical <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and the extent of plasma <START:Chemical> folate <END> elevation .
Associated studies demonstrated that <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by <START:Chemical> folic acid <END> administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce <START:Disease> toxicity <END> by enhancing <START:Chemical> lometrexol <END> plasma clearance .
The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor .
This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in <START:Disease> cancer <END> therapy .
Delayed <START:Disease> asystolic <END> <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> after <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> ; resuscitation with high dose intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium <END> .
A 51 year old man took a mixed <START:Disease> overdose <END> including 1 . 8 - 3 . 6 g of <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> , <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> , <START:Chemical> isosorbide <END> <START:Chemical> nitrate <END> , and <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> .
He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids .
Eighteen hours after the <START:Disease> overdose <END> he had two generalised <START:Disease> tonic - clonic seizures <END> .
The patient remained unresponsive with junctional <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , unrecordable blood pressure , and then became <START:Disease> asystolic <END> .
He was resuscitated with high dose ( 13 . 5 g ) intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> ( <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ) .
He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours .
This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous <START:Chemical> calcium <END> therapy in severe <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> , particularly with the onset of <START:Disease> asystole <END> .
It should be considered early in cases of <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> after <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
The case also highlights the problems with delayed <START:Disease> toxicity <END> when whole bowel irrigation is not administered .
Effects of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> on <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Atrial tachycardia <END> - induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:Disease> AF <END> ) and decreases L - type <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) current .
There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L - type <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote <START:Disease> AF <END> , consistent with an <START:Disease> AF <END> promoting effect of <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) channel inhibition .
METHODS : To evaluate the potential mechanisms of <START:Disease> AF <END> promotion by <START:Chemical> Ca <END> ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - <START:Chemical> chloralose <END> anesthetized dogs .
<START:Chemical> Diltiazem <END> was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with <START:Chemical> atropine <END> and <START:Chemical> nadolol <END> was applied in some experiments .
Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during <START:Disease> AF <END> .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> caused <START:Disease> AF <END> promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of <START:Disease> AF <END> induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / - 4 s ( mean + / - S . E . ) to 95 + / - 39 s ( P < 0 . 01 vs . control ) at a loading dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg and 228 + / - 101 s ( P < 0 . 0005 vs . control ) at a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg .
Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> .
In these experiments , <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> shortened mean effective refractory period ( ERP ) from 122 + / - 5 to 114 + / - 4 ms ( P < 0 . 02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased ERP heterogeneity ( from 15 + / - 1 to 10 + / - 1 % , P < 0 . 05 ) , heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of <START:Disease> AF <END> ( 94 + / - 4 to 84 + / - 3 ms , P < 0 . 005 ) .
<START:Chemical> Diltiazem <END> did not affect ERP , <START:Disease> AF <END> cycle length or <START:Disease> AF <END> duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> ( n = 5 ) .
In the presence of autonomic blockade , <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> failed to promote <START:Disease> AF <END> and increased , rather than decreasing , refractoriness .
Neither <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> nor <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade .
Epicardial mapping suggested that <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> promoted <START:Disease> AF <END> by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Verapamil <END> promotes <START:Disease> AF <END> in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> .
Effects of <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> and ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> , putative sigma 2 - preferring antagonists , on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> in mice .
Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma 1 receptors attenuates the <START:Disease> convulsive <END> , lethal , locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> in mice .
In contrast , the contribution of sigma 2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are unavailable .
To begin addressing this need , we characterized <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 1 - ( 2 - phenethyl ) - 4 - ( 2 - pyridyl ) - piperazine <END> ) and ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - tropanyl - 2 - ( 4 - chorophenoxy ) butyrate <END> ) in receptor binding and behavioral studies .
Receptor binding studies confirmed that <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> and ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> display preferential affinity for sigma 2 over sigma 1 receptors .
In behavioral studies , pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> or ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> significantly attenuated <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and locomotor activity , but not lethality .
When administered alone , ( + / - ) - <START:Chemical> SM 21 <END> produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline , but <START:Chemical> UMB 24 <END> had locomotor depressant actions .
Together , the data suggest that sigma 2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> , and further development of more selective , high affinity ligands are warranted .
Phase I trial of <START:Chemical> 13 - cis - retinoic acid <END> in children with <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> following bone marrow transplantation .
PURPOSE : Treatment of <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> cell lines with <START:Chemical> 13 - cis - retinoic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> ) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation .
Since <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> has demonstrated clinical responses in <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> patients , it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy .
This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal - tolerated dosage ( MTD ) , <START:Disease> toxicities <END> , and pharmacokinetics of <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> administered on an intermittent schedule in children with <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> following bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : Fifty - one assessable patients , 2 to 12 years of age , were treated with oral <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks , followed by a 2 - week rest period , for up to 12 courses .
The dose was escalated from 100 to 200 mg / m 2 / d until dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ( DLT ) was observed .
A single intrapatient dose escalation was permitted .
RESULTS : The MTD of <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> was 160 mg / m 2 / d .
Dose - limiting <START:Disease> toxicities <END> in six of nine patients at 200 mg / m 2 / d included <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> ( n = 3 ) , <START:Disease> rash <END> ( n = 2 ) , and <START:Disease> anemia <END> / <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> / <START:Disease> emesis <END> / <START:Disease> rash <END> ( n = 1 ) .
All <START:Disease> toxicities <END> resolved after <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> was discontinued .
Three complete responses were observed in marrow <START:Disease> metastases <END> .
Serum levels of 7 . 4 + / - 3 . 0 mumol / L ( peak ) and 4 . 0 + / - 2 . 8 mumol / L ( trough ) at the MTD were maintained during 14 days of therapy .
The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol / L .
CONCLUSION : The MTD of <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg / m 2 / d .
Serum levels known to be effective against <START:Disease> neuroblastoma <END> in vitro were achieved at this dose .
The DLT included <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> , and may be predicted by serum <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> levels .
Monitoring of serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and <START:Chemical> cis - RA <END> levels is indicated in future trials .
<START:Chemical> Mitomycin C <END> associated <START:Disease> hemolytic uremic syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Mitomycin C <END> associated <START:Disease> Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> HUS <END> ) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised .
It consists of microangiopathic <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> , <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> and progressive <START:Disease> renal failure <END> associated with <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> treatment and affects about 10 % of patients treated with this agent .
The <START:Disease> renal failure <END> usually develops about 8 - 10 mth after start of <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> treatment and the mortality is approximately 60 % from <START:Disease> renal failure <END> or <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> .
<START:Disease> Renal lesions <END> are similar to those seen in idiopathic <START:Disease> HUS <END> and include arteriolar fibrin <START:Disease> thrombi <END> , expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls , <START:Disease> ischemic <END> wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis .
The mechanism of action is postulated as <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> - induced endothelial cell damage .
We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr - old man with <START:Disease> gastric adenocarcinoma <END> who developed <START:Disease> renal failure <END> and <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> while on treatment with <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> and died in <START:Disease> pulmonary edema <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ciprofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in patients with <START:Disease> cancer <END> .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> associated with <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> is uncommon .
Five patients with <START:Disease> cancer <END> who developed <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> that followed treatment with <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are reviewed .
Other than elevation of serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels , characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present .
Allergic <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> is believed to be the underlying pathological - process .
Definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy , although this is not always feasible .
An improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
Cholinergic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> resulting from ocular instillation of <START:Chemical> echothiophate iodide <END> eye drops .
A patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of <START:Chemical> echothiophate iodide <END> ophthalmic drops , presented with profound <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> and was initially given the diagnosis of <START:Disease> myasthenia gravis <END> .
Red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops .
Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy .
The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs and <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> LID <END> ) .
We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> responsiveness of motor signs and the <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations ) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery , whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in <START:Disease> LID <END> .
We also found a highly significant correlation ( P : < 0 . 0001 , r = 0 . 8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in <START:Disease> LID <END> in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs .
The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> or <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs .
The differential predictive value of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> responsiveness for the outcome of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs and <START:Disease> LID <END> and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> and <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> ' off ' signs and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> , the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of <START:Disease> LID <END> .
We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy .
The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms , and hence could be variable .
Electro - oculography , electroretinography , visual evoked potentials , and multifocal electroretinography in patients with <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> - attributed <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> .
PURPOSE : Symptomatic <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> thought to be associated with <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> has been reported .
The current study investigated the visual fields and visual electrophysiology of eight patients with known <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> - attributed <START:Disease> visual field loss <END> , three of whom were reported previously .
Six of the patients were no longer receiving <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> .
METHODS : The central and peripheral fields were examined with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer .
Full visual electrophysiology , including flash electroretinography ( ERG ) , pattern electroretinography , multifocal ERG using the VERIS system , electro - oculography , and flash and pattern visual evoked potentials , was undertaken .
RESULTS : Seven patients showed marked <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> with some sparing of the temporal visual field .
The eighth exhibited concentric constriction .
Most electrophysiological responses were usually just within normal limits ; two patients had subnormal Arden electro - oculography indices ; and one patient showed an abnormally delayed photopic b wave .
However , five patients showed delayed 30 - Hz flicker b waves , and seven patients showed delayed oscillatory potentials .
Multifocal ERG showed abnormalities that sometimes correlated with the visual field appearance and confirmed that the deficit occurs at the retinal level .
CONCLUSION : Marked <START:Disease> visual field constriction <END> appears to be associated with <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> therapy .
The field defects and some electrophysiological abnormalities persist when <START:Chemical> vigabatrin <END> therapy is withdrawn .
Use of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> for the prevention of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
AIM : <START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> ( <START:Disease> HC <END> ) is a limiting side - effect of chemotherapy with <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> ( <START:Chemical> IFS <END> ) .
In the study presented here , we investigated the use of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> for the prevention of <START:Chemical> IFS <END> - induced <START:Disease> HC <END> .
METHODS : Male Wistar rats ( 150 - 200 g ; 6 rats per group ) were treated with saline or <START:Chemical> mesna <END> 5 min ( i . p . ) before and 2 and 6 h after ( v . o . ) administration of <START:Chemical> IFS <END> .
One , two or three doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> were replaced with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> alone or with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> plus <START:Chemical> mesna <END> .
<START:Disease> Cystitis <END> was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis .
RESULTS : The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by <START:Chemical> IFS <END> by 84 . 79 % and 89 . 13 % , respectively .
In addition , it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by <START:Chemical> IFS <END> .
Moreover , the addition of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> to the last two doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> was more efficient than three doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> alone when evaluated microscopically .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> mesna <END> was efficient in blocking <START:Chemical> IFS <END> - induced <START:Disease> HC <END> .
However , the replacement of last two doses of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> with saline or all of the <START:Chemical> mesna <END> doses with <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> did not prevent <START:Disease> HC <END> .
<START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> facilitates reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> in conscious rats .
The effects of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats .
Intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 1 - 30 mg kg - 1 ) produced a dose - dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate .
Also , reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> ( 1 . 25 - 2 . 5 micrograms kg - 1 ) .
Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , although causing no change in the <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced pressor effect , did enhance the <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> .
However , the <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> enhancement of <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> ( an agent blocks <START:Chemical> chloride <END> channels by binding to sites associated with the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> - <START:Chemical> GABA <END> - <START:Chemical> chloride <END> channel macromolecular complex ) .
The data indicate that <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> acts through the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> - <START:Chemical> GABA <END> - <START:Chemical> chloride <END> channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure .
Complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> following a single dose of <START:Chemical> trazodone <END> .
Forty minutes after receiving a single starting dose of <START:Chemical> trazodone <END> , a patient developed complete <START:Disease> heart block <END> .
The case illustrates that , despite the results of earlier studies , <START:Chemical> trazodone <END> ' s effect on cardiac conduction may be severe in individuals at risk for conduction delay .
<START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> in the treatment of <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> .
<START:Disease> Localized scleroderma <END> has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children .
There is no accepted or proven treatment for <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> .
Case reports of 11 patients with severe , extensive <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> who were treated with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> are summarized in this article .
This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 ( 64 % ) of 11 patients .
Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients , skin softening in 5 , and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children .
Joint stiffness and <START:Disease> contractures <END> also improved .
The dose of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg / kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months .
<START:Chemical> D - Penicillamine <END> caused <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> in 1 patient and milder reversible <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in 3 other patients ; none developed <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> may be effective in severe cases of <START:Disease> localized scleroderma <END> .
A murine model of <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> : the effects of <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> fluoxetine hydrochloride <END> , a selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor , on <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> induction in Wistar albino rats .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of this study was to investigate whether <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> given to castrated and noncastrated rats caused <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> and its effects with respect to <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> .
DESIGN : <START:Chemical> Fluoxetine <END> , a <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor , was given to Wistar Albino rats for 98 days to produce <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
The drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and noncastrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and noncastrated controls .
Prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 days .
SETTING : Marmara University School of Medicine , Department of Histology and Embryology , Zeynep Kamil Women and Children ' s Hospital .
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Serum prolactin levels , uterine histopathology .
RESULTS : The prolactin levels of castrated and noncastrated groups treated with <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control groups .
Histological studies revealed 11 cases of <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> , all within the noncastrated group receiving <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> .
CONCLUSION : It was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian <START:Chemical> steroids <END> that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stroma .
This invasion eventually progresses to <START:Disease> adenomyosis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Methimazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestatic jaundice <END> .
<START:Chemical> Methimazole <END> is a widely used and generally well - tolerated antithyroid agent .
A 43 - year - old woman had severe <START:Disease> jaundice <END> and <START:Disease> itching <END> 1 month after receiving <START:Chemical> methimazole <END> ( 10 mg tid ) and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> ( 20 mg tid ) for treatment of <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> .
The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of <START:Disease> jaundice <END> until she finished both medications .
When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later , she still had severe <START:Disease> icterus <END> , <START:Disease> pruritus <END> , and <START:Disease> hyperbilirubinemia <END> , formed mainly of the conjugated fraction .
<START:Chemical> Methimazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> was diagnosed , and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> therapy was resumed .
Over the following 9 days , the symptoms improved and plasma <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> levels were normal after 12 weeks without <START:Chemical> methimazole <END> .
In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy , this drug can cause severe and reversible <START:Disease> cholestatic jaundice <END> .
Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that , upon occurrence , they can discontinue <START:Chemical> methimazole <END> therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures .
Central <START:Disease> vein thrombosis <END> and topical <START:Chemical> dipivalyl epinephrine <END> .
A report is given on an 83 - year - old female who acquired central <START:Disease> vein thrombosis <END> in her seeing eye one day after having started topical medication with <START:Chemical> dipivalyl epinephrine <END> for advanced <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> discovered in the other eye .
From present knowledge about the effects of adrenergic eye drops on ocular blood circulation , it is difficult to suggest an association between the two events , which may be coincidental only .
Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients .
OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> in adult emergency department <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients .
METHODS : This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation .
Plasma was tested for <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> and the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> metabolite <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> using enzyme - mediated immunoassay methodology .
Plasma samples with <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> greater than 150 ng / mL or an <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> greater than 500 ng / mL were defined as positive .
Patient demographics , history of underlying drug or <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - related <START:Disease> seizure <END> disorder , estimated time from <START:Disease> seizure <END> to sample collection , history or suspicion of <START:Disease> cocaine or amphetamine abuse <END> , results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers .
RESULTS : Fourteen of 248 ( 5 . 6 % , 95 % CI 2 . 7 % - 8 . 5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % CI 0 - 1 . 2 % ) were positive for <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> .
Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of <START:Disease> cocaine or amphetamine abuse <END> ( p < 0 . 0005 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : During this study period , routine plasma screening for <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> amphetamines <END> in adult <START:Disease> seizure <END> patients had a low yield .
As a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of <START:Disease> drug abuse <END> in this population .
Adverse interaction between <START:Chemical> beta - adrenergic blocking drugs <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> -- report of three cases .
Three patients with <START:Disease> ischaemic heart disease <END> developed profound <START:Disease> cardiac failure <END> , <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> during combined therapy with <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> and <START:Chemical> beta - adrenergic blocking drugs <END> .
This clinical picture resolved completely with cessation of the combined therapy .
Baseline left ventricular function , assessed by cardiac catheterisation or nuclear angiography , was normal in two patients and only mildly reduced in the other .
Simultaneously administration of <START:Chemical> beta - adrenergic blocking drugs <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> may result in profound adverse interactions and should only be administered with great caution .
<START:Chemical> Thiazide <END> diuretics , <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> .
<START:Chemical> Thiazide <END> diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment programs .
<START:Disease> Hypokalemia <END> is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> therapy .
We treated 38 patients ( 22 low renin , 16 normal renin ) with moderate <START:Disease> diastolic hypertension <END> with <START:Chemical> hydrochlorothiazide <END> ( <START:Chemical> HCTC <END> ) administered on a twice daily schedule .
Initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg , 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normalized .
The serum <START:Chemical> K <END> during the control period was 4 . 5 + / - 0 . 2 mEq / l an on 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 mg <START:Chemical> HCTZ <END> daily 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 3 , 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 2 , 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 2 , and 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 mEq / l , respectively .
Corresponding figures for whole body <START:Chemical> K <END> were 4107 + / - 208 , 3722 + / - 319 , 3628 + / - 257 , 3551 + / - 336 , and 3269 + / - 380 mEq , respectively .
In 13 patients we observed the effects of <START:Chemical> HCTZ <END> therapy ( 100 mg daily ) on the occurrence of PVC ' s during rest as well as during static and dynamic exercise .
During rest we observed 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 08 PVC beats / min + / - SEM and during static and dynamic exercise 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 06 and 0 . 8 + / - 0 . 15 , respectively .
Corresponding figures during <START:Chemical> HCTZ <END> therapy 100 mg daily were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 1 , 3 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 and 5 . 7 4 / - 0 . 8 , respectively .
The occurrence of PVC ' s correlated significantly with the fall in serum <START:Chemical> K <END> + observed r = 0 . 72 , p less than 0 . 001 .
In conclusion we found that <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> diuretics cause <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> and depletion of body <START:Chemical> potassium <END> .
The more profound <START:Disease> hypokalemia <END> , the greater the propensity for the occurrence of PVC ' s .
<START:Disease> Orthostatic hypotension <END> occurs following alpha 2 - adrenoceptor blockade in chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> - pretreated conscious spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
1 . Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment alters the alpha 2 - adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats ( SHR ) .
2 .
Conscious SHR ( male 300 - 350 g ) were subjected to 90 degrees head - up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) or <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( 3 mg kg - 1 i . v . ) .
<START:Disease> Orthostatic hypotension <END> was determined by the average decrease ( % ) in mean arterial pressure ( MAP femoral ) over the 60 - s tilt period .
The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( - 23 % ( - ) - 26 % MAP ) and <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( - 16 % ( - ) - 33 % MAP ) .
However , the head - up tilt induced <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> in the SHR treated with <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( - 16 % MAP , n = 6 ) , but not in the SHR treated with <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( less than + 2 % MAP , n = 6 ) .
3 .
Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> at 2 mg kg - 1 day - 1 i . p . for chronic alpha 1 - adrenoceptor blockade .
MAP in conscious SHR after chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment was 14 % lower than in the untreated SHR ( n = 8 ) .
Head - up tilts in these rats did not produce <START:Disease> orthostatic hypotension <END> when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> ( 0 . 1 mg kg - 1 i . p . ) .
Conversely , administration of <START:Chemical> rauwolscine <END> ( 3 mg kg - 1 i . v . ) in chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12 - 31 % ( n = 4 ) , and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19 - 23 % in these rats .
4 . The pressor responses and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> to the alpha 1 - agonist <START:Chemical> cirazoline <END> ( 0 . 6 and 2 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) , the alpha 2 - agonist <START:Chemical> Abbott - 53693 <END> ( 1 and 3 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) , and <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> ( 0 . 1 and 1 . 0 micrograms kg - 1 i . v . ) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> pretreatment .
Both the pressor and <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> effects of <START:Chemical> cirazoline <END> were abolished in chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treated SHR ( n = 4 ) as compared to the untreated SHR ( n = 4 ) .
On the other hand , the pressor effects of <START:Chemical> Abbott - 53693 <END> were similar in both groups of SHR , but the accompanying <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was greater in SHR with chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment than without such treatment .
Furthermore , the <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> that accompanied the <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> - induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> treatment despite a 47 - 71 % reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1 - receptor blocked SHR . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS )
Value of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> in prevention of the <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> - <START:Disease> myalgia <END> syndrome associated with the total dose infusion of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> : a double blind randomized trial .
The safety and efficacy of total dose infusion ( TDI ) of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> has been well documented .
In 40 % of treated patients , an <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> - <START:Disease> myalgia <END> syndrome develops .
The purpose of this randomized , double - blind , prospective study was to investigate whether intravenous ( i . v . ) administration of <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> MP <END> ) prevents this complication .
Sixty - five patients , 34 women and 31 men , ages 36 to 80 years , received either normal saline before and after TDI ( group 1 ) , 125 mg i . v . <START:Chemical> MP <END> before and saline after TDI ( group 2 ) , or 125 mg i . v . <START:Chemical> MP <END> before and after TDI ( group 3 ) .
Patients were observed for 72 hours and reactions were recorded and graded according to severity .
Fifty - eight percent of group 1 patients , 33 % of group 2 , and 26 % of group 3 had reactions to TDI .
The severity of reactions ( minimal , mild , and moderate , respectively ) was as follows : group 1 -- 6 , 6 , and 2 ; group 2 -- 1 , 5 , and 0 ; group 3 -- 5 , 1 , and 0 .
Data were analyzed by the two - sided Fisher ' s exact test using 95 % confidence intervals with the approximation of Woolf .
These data demonstrate that administration of <START:Chemical> MP <END> before and after TDI reduces the frequency and severity of the <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> - <START:Disease> myalgia <END> syndrome .
We conclude that 125 mg i . v . <START:Chemical> MP <END> should be given routinely before and after TDI of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> .
Reverse or inverted <START:Disease> left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome <END> ( reverse <START:Disease> Takotsubo cardiomyopathy <END> ) in a young woman in the setting of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use .
Transient <START:Disease> left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome <END> was first described in Japan as " <START:Disease> Takotsubo cardiomyopathy <END> . "
This syndrome has been identified in many other countries .
Many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the literature .
One of the rarest is the reverse type of this syndrome , with hyperdynamic apex and complete <START:Disease> akinesia <END> of the base ( as opposed to the classic <START:Disease> apical ballooning <END> ) .
In this article , we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse <START:Disease> apical ballooning syndrome <END> occurring after <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use .
This report is followed by review of the literature .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> and thalamotomy .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> of the limbs in thirteen cases of <START:Disease> Parkinsonism <END> , which was choreic , ballistic or <START:Disease> dystonic <END> in type , was alleviated almost completely by stereotaxic surgery using a microelectrode technique for the ventralis oralis anterior and posterior nuclei of the thalamus , but much less by the ventralis intermedius nucleus .
Control of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> by <START:Disease> thalamic lesions <END> in the course of routine treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinsonism <END> is discussed .
Protective effect of a specific platelet - activating factor antagonist , <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> , on <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular impairments <END> in rats .
Administration of the local anaesthetic <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( 1 . 5 or 2 mg / kg , i . v . ) to rats elicited a marked <START:Disease> decrease of mean arterial blood pressure ( MBP ) and heart rate ( HR ) <END> leading to death ( in 67 % or 90 % of animals respectively ) .
Intravenous injection of the specific platelet - activating factor ( PAF ) antagonist <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) , 30 min before <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> administration ( 2 mg / kg i . v . ) suppressed both the <START:Disease> decrease of MBP and HR <END> .
In contrast , doses of 1 mg / kg <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> given 30 min before or 10 mg / kg administered 5 min before i . v . injection of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> were ineffective .
When <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> ( 20 mg / kg i . v . ) was injected immediately after <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> ( 2 mg / kg ) , a partial reversion of the <START:Disease> decrease of MBP and HR <END> was observed , whereas the dose of 10 mg / kg was ineffective .
A partial recovery of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> .
Since the administration of <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> , at all doses studied , did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used , the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of <START:Chemical> BN 52021 <END> , a specific antagonist of PAF , against <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicity <END> .
Thus , consistent with its direct effect on heart , PAF appears to be implicated in <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiovascular alterations <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> after <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> administration in a pediatric patient .
<START:Chemical> Flumazenil <END> is a <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> receptor antagonist used to reverse sedation and <START:Disease> respiratory depression <END> induced by <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> have complicated its use in adult patients .
<START:Disease> Overdose <END> patients who have coingested tricyclic antidepressants have a higher risk of these complications .
Little information exists concerning adverse effects of <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> in children .
We report the occurrence of a generalized <START:Disease> tonic - clonic seizure <END> in a pediatric patient following the administration of <START:Chemical> flumazenil <END> .
Pallidal stimulation : an alternative to pallidotomy ?
A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985 .
Laitinen ' s procedure improved most symptoms in drug - resistant <START:Disease> PD <END> , which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community .
Another lesioning procedure , ventrolateral thalamotomy , has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius , producing high long - term success rates and low morbidity rates .
Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success .
According to the literature pallidotomy improves the " on " symptoms of <START:Disease> PD <END> , such as <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , as well as the " off " symptoms , such as <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> bradykinesia <END> , and on - off fluctuations .
Pallidal stimulation improves <START:Disease> bradykinesia <END> and <START:Disease> rigidity <END> to a minor extent ; however , its strength seems to be in improving <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
Stimulation often produces an improvement in the <START:Disease> hyper - or dyskinetic <END> upper limbs , but increases the " freezing " phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time .
Considering the small increase in the patient ' s independence , the high costs of bilateral implants , and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices , the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy .
Sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> in elderly patients undergoing <START:Disease> hip fracture <END> repair .
OBJECTIVE : To determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for <START:Disease> hip fracture <END> repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : We performed a double - blind , randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( > or = 65 years ) without preoperative <START:Disease> delirium <END> or severe <START:Disease> dementia <END> who underwent <START:Disease> hip fracture <END> repair under spinal anesthesia with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> sedation .
Sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispectral index ( BIS ) , and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( BIS , approximately 50 ) or light ( BIS , > or = 80 ) sedation .
<START:Disease> Postoperative delirium <END> was assessed as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of <START:Disease> Mental Disorders <END> ( Third Edition Revised ) criteria using the Confusion Assessment Method beginning at any time from the second day after surgery .
RESULTS : From April 2 , 2005 , through October 30 , 2008 , a total of 114 patients were randomized .
The prevalence of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 [ 19 % ] vs 23 / 57 [ 40 % ] in the deep sedation group ; P = . 02 ) , indicating that 1 incident of <START:Disease> delirium <END> will be prevented for every 4 . 7 patients treated with light sedation .
The mean + / - SD number of days of <START:Disease> delirium <END> during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group ( 0 . 5 + / - 1 . 5 days vs 1 . 4 + / - 4 . 0 days ; P = . 01 ) .
CONCLUSION : The use of light <START:Chemical> propofol <END> sedation decreased the prevalence of <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> by 50 % compared with deep sedation .
Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple , safe , and cost - effective intervention for preventing <START:Disease> postoperative delirium <END> in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted .
An evaluation of <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in the hematology / oncology population .
<START:Chemical> Amikacin <END> is an <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> commonly used to provide empirical double gram - negative treatment for <START:Disease> febrile neutropenia <END> and other suspected <START:Disease> infections <END> .
Strategies of extended - interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population ; however , data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology / oncology population .
To evaluate <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> - associated <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in an adult hematology / oncology population , a prospective , randomized , open - label trial was conducted at a university - affiliated medical center .
Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a <START:Disease> hematologic / oncologic disorder <END> that required treatment with an <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> were randomized to either conventional or extended - interval <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> by means of an increase in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> and evaluation of efficacy via <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> was similar between the conventional and extended - interval groups , at 10 % and 5 % , respectively ( P = 1 . 00 ) .
Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture , compared with none in the extended - interval group ( P = 0 . 002 ) .
The occurrence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> was similar between the two dosing regimens , but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups .
Efficacy could not be assessed .
Quantitative drug levels in stimulant <START:Disease> psychosis <END> : relationship to symptom severity , <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> and <START:Disease> hyperkinesia <END> .
To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels , <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> , and <START:Disease> psychotic symptoms <END> , nineteen patients in a <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> emergency service with a diagnosis of <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - or <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> were interviewed , and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and <START:Chemical> catecholamine <END> metabolite levels .
<START:Chemical> Methamphetamine <END> or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global <START:Disease> hyperkinesia <END> rating .
HVA levels were related to global <START:Disease> hyperkinesia <END> but not to psychopathology ratings .
Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role , intensity of stimulant - induced <START:Disease> psychotic symptoms <END> and <START:Disease> stereotypies <END> appears to be at least in part dose - related .
<START:Chemical> Midazolam <END> compared with <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> as an induction agent .
In patients premedicated with <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> + <START:Chemical> morphine <END> ( + 5 mg <START:Chemical> nitrazepam <END> the evening before surgery ) , the sleep - inducing effect of <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> 0 . 15 mg / kg i . v . was clearly slower in onset than that of <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> 4 . 67 mg / kg i . v . Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group , but , although <START:Disease> apnoea <END> occurred less often in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group it lasted longer .
On the whole , the differences between <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> and <START:Chemical> thiopentone <END> had no apparent clinical consequences .
<START:Chemical> Midazolam <END> is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia .
Factors associated with <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and clinical outcome in patients receiving <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> .
Data from 60 patients treated with <START:Chemical> amikacin <END> were analyzed for factors associated with <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
In 42 of these patients , data were examined for factors associated with clinical outcome .
Variables evaluated included patient weight , age , sex , serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> level , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> clearance , duration of therapy , total dose , mean daily dose , organism minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) , mean peak levels , mean trough levels , mean area under the serum concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , total AUC , mean AUC greater than MIC , total AUC greater than MIC , mean Schumacher ' s intensity factor ( IF ) , total IF , In ( mean maximum concentration [ Cmax ] / MIC ) .
Model - dependent pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by computer based on a one - compartment model .
When the parameters were examined individually , duration of therapy and total AUC correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
In contrast , a stepwise discriminant function analysis identified only duration of therapy ( P less than . 001 ) as an important factor .
Based on this model and on Bayes ' theorem , the predictive accuracy of identifying " <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> " patients increased from 0 . 17 to 0 . 39 .
When examined individually , mean IF , MIC , total dose , mean daily dose , and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) correlated significantly ( P less than . 05 ) with cure .
In contrast , a simultaneous multivariable analysis identified IF , MIC , and total dose according to one model and ln ( mean Cmax / MIC ) according to a second statistical model of parameters selected to have the greatest prospective value .
Based on Bayes ' theorem and the first model , the predictive accuracy of identifying patients not cured increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 83 .
For the second model , the predictive accuracy increased from 0 . 19 to 0 . 50 . ( ABSTRACT

Time dependence of plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> , and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> during incomplete <START:Disease> cerebral ischemia <END> in the rat .
Incomplete <START:Disease> cerebral ischemia <END> ( 30 min ) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries .
Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times ( once every 5 min ) before <START:Disease> ischemia <END> ( 0 time ) and 5 , 15 , and 30 min after <START:Disease> ischemia <END> .
Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high - performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> , and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> .
During <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , a time - dependent increase of plasma <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> was observed .
Plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , which was present in minimal amount at zero time ( 0 . 058 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 015 ) , increased after 5 min of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion ( 0 . 298 mumol / liter plasma ; SD 0 . 078 ) .
Increased plasma <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model , one receiving 20 mg / kg b . w . of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylate <END> intravenously immediately before <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , the other receiving 650 micrograms / kg b . w . of the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> drug <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> at a flow rate of 103 microliters / min intravenously during <START:Disease> ischemia <END> , although in this latter group <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> was significantly higher .
The present data indicate that the determination of <START:Chemical> malondialdehyde <END> , <START:Chemical> oxypurines <END> , and <START:Chemical> nucleosides <END> in peripheral blood , may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during <START:Disease> ischemic <END> phenomena .

Treatment of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> - related adverse effects by conversion to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> in liver transplant recipients .
When <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> side effects persist despite dose reduction , conversion to <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> - based immunosuppression ( CyA ) is necessary .
We characterized <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug , and outcomes after conversion .
Of 388 liver recipients who received <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> as primary immunosuppression , 70 required conversion to CyA .
We recorded indication for conversion , whether conversion was early or late after transplantation , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> dose and trough blood level at conversion , and incidence of rejection after conversion .
Conversion was early in 29 patients ( 41 . 4 % ) and late in 41 ( 58 . 6 % ) .
Indications for early conversion were <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> ( 20 ) , <START:Disease> ( insulin - dependent ) diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:Disease> IDDM <END> ) ( 5 ) , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 3 ) , <START:Disease> gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity <END> ( 6 ) , and <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( 1 ) , and for late conversion were <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> ( 15 ) , <START:Disease> IDDM <END> ( 12 ) , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 3 ) , <START:Disease> GI toxicity <END> ( 5 ) , <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> ( 6 ) , <START:Disease> post - transplant lmphoproliferate disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PTLD <END> ) ( 2 ) , <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> ( 1 ) , <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> ( 1 ) , and <START:Disease> pruritus <END> ( 1 ) .
All early - conversion patients showed improvement / resolution of symptoms .
Among late - conversion patients , 37 ( 90 . 2 % ) had improvement / resolution ; in 4 ( 9 . 8 % ) , adverse effects persisted .
The overall rejection rate was 30 % .
Sixty - two patients ( 88 . 6 % ) are alive with functioning grafts 686 + / - 362 days ( range , 154 - 1433 days ) after conversion .
When <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction , conversion to CyA can be accomplished safely , with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long - term outcome .
Photodistributed <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> - induced facial <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> .
Five months after starting <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Adalat <END> ) , two patients developed photodistributed facial <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> , which became more noticeable with time .
Neither patient complained of photosensitivity or <START:Disease> flushing <END> .
Both patients reported a significant cosmetic improvement after discontinuing the drug .
One commenced the closely related drug <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> 3 years later , with recurrence of <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> .
The photodistribution of the <START:Disease> telangiectasia <END> suggests a significant drug / light interaction .
Prolonged <START:Disease> paralysis <END> due to <START:Chemical> nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents <END> and <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
The long - term use of <START:Chemical> nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents <END> ( <START:Chemical> ND - NMBA <END> ) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged <START:Disease> muscle weakness <END> , although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been unclear .
We report 3 patients ( age 37 - 52 years ) with acute <START:Disease> respiratory insufficiency <END> who developed prolonged <START:Disease> weakness <END> following the discontinuation of <START:Chemical> ND - NMBAs <END> .
Two patients also received intravenous <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
Renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients , and all had <START:Disease> acidosis <END> .
Electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials , normal sensory studies , and fibrillations .
Repetitive stimulation at 2 Hz showed a decremental response in 2 patients .
The serum <START:Chemical> vecuronium <END> level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng / mL .
A muscle biopsy in this patient showed <START:Disease> loss of thick , myosin filaments <END> .
The <START:Disease> weakness <END> in these patients is due to <START:Disease> pathology at both the neuromuscular junction <END> ( most likely due to <START:Chemical> ND - NMBA <END> ) and muscle ( most likely due to <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Hepatic dysfunction <END> and <START:Disease> acidosis <END> are contributing risk factors .
<START:Disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> following chemotherapy for stage IIIE diffuse large B - cell <START:Disease> gastric lymphoma <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> myotonic dystrophy <END> ( <START:Disease> Steinert ' s disease <END> ) .
The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B - cell <START:Disease> gastric lymphoma <END> and <START:Disease> myotonic dystrophy <END> , the most common form of adult <START:Disease> muscular dystrophy <END> , and sudden <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> following one cycle of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - based chemotherapy in the same patient .
<START:Disease> Atrial fibrillation <END> or other <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> are unusual complications in patients treated with chemotherapy .
The <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> in the predisposed myocardium of this patient .
Comparison of the effectiveness of <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> and <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
The H 2 - <START:Chemical> histamine <END> receptor antagonists <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> and <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short - and long - term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states .
Nineteen patients had <START:Disease> Zollinger - Ellison syndrome <END> , one patient had <START:Disease> systemic mastocytosis <END> , and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion .
The rates of onset of the action of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> and <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> were the same .
The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents , and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion .
However , <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> was threefold more potent than <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed ( 1 . 2 g per day for <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> and 3 . 6 g per day for <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> ) .
Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or <START:Disease> impotence <END> while taking <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> and in all cases these changes disappeared when <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> was replaced by <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> .
Treatment with high doses of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> ( one to 60 months ; median , 11 months ) or <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> ( two to 31 months ; median , 14 months ) was not associated with <START:Disease> hepatic or hematologic toxicity <END> or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations , but <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> level than seen with <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> therapy .
The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states .
Both are safe at high doses , but <START:Chemical> ranitidine <END> is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of <START:Chemical> cimetidine <END> .
Ocular manifestations of <START:Disease> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
We followed 210 cases of <START:Disease> juvenile rheumatoid arthritis <END> closely for eleven years .
Thirty - six of the 210 patients ( 17 . 2 % ) developed <START:Disease> iridocyclitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Iridocyclitis <END> was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the monoarticular or pauciatricular form of the <START:Disease> arthritis <END> .
However , 30 % of the patients developed <START:Disease> uveitis <END> after 16 years of age .
Although 61 % of patients had a noncontributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active <START:Disease> uveitis <END> on entry .
Our approach was effective in detecting <START:Disease> uveitis <END> in new cases and exacerbations of <START:Disease> uveitis <END> in established cases .
Forty - four percent of patients with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , <START:Disease> ocular pain <END> , <START:Disease> decreased visual acuity <END> , or <START:Disease> photophobia <END> , in order of decreasing frequency .
Even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of <START:Disease> uveitis <END> did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> and mydriatics .
Despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of <START:Disease> uveitis <END> cited in earlier studies .
<START:Disease> Cataract <END> and <START:Disease> band keratopathy <END> occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respectively .
We used <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> or <START:Chemical> hydroxychloroquine <END> in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of <START:Disease> chorioretinopathy <END> attributable to these drugs .
Systemically administered <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular <START:Disease> cataracts <END> was found .
Typical <START:Disease> keratoconjunctivitis <END> sicca developed in three of the <START:Disease> uveitis <END> cases .
This association with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> and JRA was not noted previously .
Surgical treatment of <START:Disease> cataracts <END> , <START:Disease> band keratopathy <END> , and <START:Disease> glaucoma <END> achieved uniformly discouraging results .
Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> on canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
Antiarrhythmic effects of ( + ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> and ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> were examined using two canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> models .
<START:Chemical> Digitalis <END> <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , which is suppressed by <START:Chemical> Na <END> channel blockers , was induced by intermittent intravenous ( i . v . ) injection of <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> in <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> - anesthetized dogs .
<START:Disease> Adrenaline arrhythmia <END> , which is suppressed by <START:Chemical> Ca <END> channel blockers , was induced by <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> infusion in <START:Chemical> halothane <END> - anesthetized dogs .
Ten and 5 mg / kg i . v . ( + ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> suppressed <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> , respectively .
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of ( + ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> for <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> were 1 . 4 + / - 0 . 4 and 2 . 0 + / - 0 . 6 micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SD , n = 6 ) .
A lower dose of 1 mg / kg i . v . of ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> suppressed the <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , whereas 5 mg / kg i . v . was needed to suppress <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> .
The minimum effective plasma concentrations of ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> for <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> were 0 . 06 + / - 0 . 04 and 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 1 micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SD , n = 6 ) .
The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of ( - ) - <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> indicates that ( - ) - isomer may have an effect nearly 5 - 20 times stronger in suppressing <START:Chemical> Na <END> channels , but effects of both drugs on <START:Chemical> Ca <END> channels may be almost equipotent .
<START:Chemical> GABA <END> involvement in <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> induced reversal of <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> produced by <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> .
No agent is yet available to reverse <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> produced by CNS depressants , such as general anesthetics .
In this study <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> reversed <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> in rats .
25 mg / kg , i . v . <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate , increased <START:Chemical> GABA <END> , decreased <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> , and had no effect on <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> or <START:Chemical> glycine <END> levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem .
Pretreatment of rats with <START:Chemical> thiosemicarbazide <END> for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> .
50 mg / kg , i . v . <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> produced <START:Disease> respiratory arrest <END> with further increase in <START:Chemical> GABA <END> and decrease in <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the <START:Chemical> amino acids <END> studied in four regions of rat brain .
<START:Chemical> Naloxone <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg , i . v . ) reversed <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> , <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> GABA <END> levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum .
These data suggest <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> reverses <START:Disease> respiratory paralysis <END> produced by <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> and involves <START:Chemical> GABA <END> in its action .
Receptor mechanisms of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> in chronic <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - treated rats .
Rats were pretreated with saline or <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> ( 1 . 5 mg / kg per day ) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini - pump which continuously released saline or <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 1 , 5 and 14 days .
At the end of each pretreatment period , animals were used for ( i ) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> ( 0 . 2 mg / kg , s . c . ) and ( ii ) measuring the density of L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> and [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding sites in the striatum .
We observed no changes in <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced locomotor response , striatal L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> and [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding in the animals pretreated with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 1 day .
In rats which were pretreated with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 5 days , there was a significant increase in the <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> binding sites and also with an elevated <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) level in the striatum .
The number of striatal [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding sites was not affected .
In animals pretreated with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> for 14 days , the <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated .
However , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> spiperone <END> binding sites , whereas the number of striatal L - [ 3 H ] <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> binding sites and the striatal <START:Chemical> DA <END> level were normal .
These results suggest that chronic <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> - treated rats develop <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> in response to <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and <START:Chemical> DA <END> concentration , followed by inducing <START:Chemical> DA <END> receptor supersensitivity in the striatum .
Nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 , E 2 , or F 2 alpha <END> to conscious mice .
The effects of intrathecal administration of <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> on <START:Disease> pain <END> responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and <START:Chemical> acetic acid <END> writhing tests .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin D 2 <END> ( 0 . 5 - 3 ng / mouse ) had a <START:Disease> hyperalgesic <END> action on the response to a hot plate during a 3 - 60 min period after injection .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin E 2 <END> showed a <START:Disease> hyperalgesic <END> effect at doses of 1 <START:Chemical> pg <END> to 10 ng / mouse , but the effect lasted shorter ( 3 - 30 min ) than that of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 <END> .
Similar results were obtained by <START:Chemical> acetic acid <END> writhing tests .
The <START:Disease> hyperalgesic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 <END> was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance P antagonist ( greater than or equal to 100 ng ) but not by <START:Chemical> AH 6809 <END> , a prostanoid EP 1 - receptor antagonist .
Conversely , <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 2 <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> was blocked by <START:Chemical> AH 6809 <END> ( greater than or equal to 500 ng ) but not by the substance P antagonist .
<START:Chemical> Prostaglandin F 2 alpha <END> had little effect on <START:Disease> pain <END> responses .
These results demonstrate that both <START:Chemical> prostaglandin D 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E 2 <END> exert <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> in the spinal cord , but in different ways .
Identification of a simple and sensitive microplate method for the detection of oversulfated <START:Chemical> chondroitin sulfate <END> in <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patients .
Recently , a number of commercial lots of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products were found to be contaminated with an oversulfated <START:Chemical> chondroitin sulfate <END> ( OSCS ) derivative that could elicit a <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response in pigs following a single high - dose infusion .
Using both contaminated <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products and the synthetically produced derivative , we showed that the OSCS produces dose - dependent <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in pigs .
The no observed effect level ( NOEL ) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1 mg / kg , corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3 % .
We also demonstrated that OSCS can be identified in <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products using a simple , inexpensive , commercially available <START:Chemical> heparin <END> enzyme immunoassay ( EIA ) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0 . 1 % , well below the NOEL .
This kit may provide a useful method to test <START:Chemical> heparin <END> products for contamination with oversulfated GAG derivatives .
<START:Chemical> Valproic acid <END> I : time course of lipid peroxidation biomarkers , <START:Disease> liver toxicity <END> , and <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> metabolite levels in rats .
A single dose of <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) , which is a widely used antiepileptic drug , is associated with oxidative stress in rats , as recently demonstrated by elevated levels of <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - isoprostane <END> ( <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> ) .
To determine whether there was a temporal relationship between <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - associated oxidative stress and <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> , adult male Sprague - Dawley rats were treated ip with <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ( 500 mg / kg ) or 0 . 9 % saline ( vehicle ) once daily for 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , or 14 days .
Oxidative stress was assessed by determining plasma and liver levels of <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> , <START:Chemical> lipid hydroperoxides <END> ( <START:Chemical> LPO <END> ) , and <START:Chemical> thiobarbituric acid reactive substances <END> ( <START:Chemical> TBARs <END> ) .
Plasma and liver <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> were elevated and reached a plateau after day 2 of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> treatment compared to control .
Liver <START:Chemical> LPO <END> levels were not elevated until day 7 of treatment ( 1 . 8 - fold versus control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
Liver and plasma <START:Chemical> TBARs <END> were not increased until 14 days ( 2 - fold vs . control , p < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Disease> Liver toxicity <END> was evaluated based on serum levels of alpha - <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> S - transferase ( alpha - GST ) and by histology .
Serum alpha - GST levels were significantly elevated by day 4 , which corresponded to <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> as shown by the increasing incidence of <START:Disease> inflammation <END> of the liver capsule , <START:Disease> necrosis <END> , and <START:Disease> steatosis <END> throughout the study .
The liver levels of beta - oxidation metabolites of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> were decreased by day 14 , while the levels of <START:Chemical> 4 - ene - VPA <END> and ( E ) - <START:Chemical> 2 , 4 - diene - VPA <END> were not elevated throughout the study .
Overall , these findings indicate that <START:Chemical> VPA <END> treatment results in oxidative stress , as measured by levels of <START:Chemical> 15 - F ( 2 t ) - IsoP <END> , which precedes the onset of <START:Disease> necrosis <END> , <START:Disease> steatosis <END> , and elevated levels of serum alpha - GST .
<START:Chemical> Topiramate <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Topiramate <END> is a recently developed antiepileptic medication that is becoming more widely prescribed because of its efficacy in treating <START:Disease> refractory seizures <END> .
Urologists should be aware that this medication can cause <START:Disease> metabolic acidosis <END> in patients secondary to inhibition of carbonic anhydrase .
In addition , a distal tubular acidification defect may result , thus impairing the normal compensatory drop in urine pH .
These factors can lead to the development of <START:Chemical> calcium phosphate <END> <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> .
We report the first two cases of <START:Chemical> topiramate <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrolithiasis <END> in the urologic literature .
Fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> due to <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> -- lymphocyte transformation tests in vitro .
Although <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> has been implicated as a possible cause of <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> on the basis of a few clinical observations , its role has not been definitely established .
A case of fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> is described in which no drugs other than <START:Chemical> allopurinol <END> and <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> were given .
<START:Chemical> Indomethacin <END> was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptoms .
A positive lymphocyte transformation test with <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> in vitro further substantiates the potential role of this drug in causing <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> in a susceptible patient .
Fortunately , this seems to be a very rare complication .
Effect of some convulsants on the protective activity of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> and its combinations with <START:Chemical> valproate <END> or <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> in amygdala - kindled rats .
<START:Chemical> Loreclezole <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) exerted a significant protective action in amygdala - kindled rats , reducing both <START:Disease> seizure <END> and afterdischarge durations .
The combinations of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) with <START:Chemical> valproate <END> , <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> , or <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> ( applied at their subprotective doses ) also exhibited antiseizure effect in this test .
However , only two first combinations occurred to be of pharmacodynamic nature .
Among several chemoconvulsants , <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> , <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartic acid <END> and <START:Chemical> BAY k - 8644 <END> ( the opener of L - type <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channels ) reversed the protective activity of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> alone and its combination with <START:Chemical> valproate <END> .
On the other hand , <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> , <START:Chemical> aminophylline <END> and <START:Chemical> BAY k - 8644 <END> inhibited the anticonvulsive action of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> combined with <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> .
The results support the hypothesis that the protective activity of <START:Chemical> loreclezole <END> and its combinations with other antiepileptics may involve potentiation of GABAergic neurotransmission and blockade of L - type of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> channels .
Effect of <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> on <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats .
Effect of methanolic extract of <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> ( 100 - 300 mg / kg ) was studied on <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced orofacial <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> and neurochemical alterations .
The rats were treated with intraperitoneal <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> ( 1 mg / kg , ip ) for 3 days every other day .
On day 5 , vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min .
<START:Chemical> Reserpine <END> treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however , coadministration of <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> roots extract ( 100 , 200 and 300 mg / kg , per orally ) attenuated the effects .
Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> reductase ( GSH ) , an index of oxidative stress process .
Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD , CAT and GSH levels .
The results of the present study suggested that <START:Chemical> Hibiscus rosa sinensis <END> had a protective role against <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> - induced orofacial <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> and oxidative stress .
<START:Chemical> Ketanserin <END> pretreatment reverses <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
Systemic pretreatment with <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> , a relatively specific type - 2 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> receptor antagonist , significantly attenuated the <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> produced in rats by the potent short - acting opiate agonist <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> .
Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal ' s left gastrocnemius muscle , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> was assessed by analyzing root - mean - square electromyographic activity .
Intraperitoneal <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> administration at doses of 0 . 63 and 2 . 5 mg / kg prevented the <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline .
<START:Chemical> Chlordiazepoxide <END> at doses up to 10 mg / kg failed to significantly influence the <START:Disease> rigidity <END> produced by <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> .
Despite the absence of <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , animals that received <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> ( greater than 0 . 31 mg / kg i . p . ) followed by <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> were motionless , flaccid , and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> alone .
Rats that received <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> and <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60 - min recording period than did animals that received <START:Chemical> ketanserin <END> alone .
These results , in combination with previous work , suggest that <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> , a clinically relevant side - effect of parenteral narcotic administration , may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways .
Pretreatment with type - 2 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate - induced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS , <START:Disease> cardiovascular , and respiratory depression <END> .
Mechanisms of <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> : comparison with exercise - induced <START:Disease> ischemia <END> .
The role of <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> in eliciting <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> was examined in patients with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> .
Objective signs of <START:Disease> ischemia <END> and factors increasing myocardial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> consumption were compared during <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> infusion and supine bicycle exercise .
Both <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> and exercise produced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> as evidenced by ST segment <START:Disease> depression <END> and <START:Disease> angina <END> .
However , the mechanisms of <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> were significantly different from those of exercise .
Exercise - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate - pressure product with a minor contribution of end - diastolic volume , while <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> - induced <START:Disease> ischemia <END> was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate - pressure product .
These findings indicate that <START:Disease> ischemia <END> produced by <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .
<START:Disease> Cerebral hemorrhage <END> associated with <START:Chemical> phenylpropanolamine <END> in combination with <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Phenylpropanolamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PPA <END> ) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including <START:Disease> stroke <END> .
It is often combined with <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> in diet preparations and " look - alike " pills .
In order to determine if <START:Chemical> PPA <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> can lead to <START:Disease> stroke <END> in normotensive and / or <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats , we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days .
<START:Disease> Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage <END> was noted in 18 % of the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> rats .
A single <START:Chemical> PPA <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> administration ( same dose ) lead to acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> in both the normotensive and <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> animals .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> PPA <END> / <START:Chemical> caffeine <END> can lead to <START:Disease> cerebral hemorrhage <END> in previously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage .
An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor .
Pharmacology of <START:Chemical> GYKI - 41 099 <END> ( <START:Chemical> chlorpropanol <END> , <START:Chemical> Tobanum <END> ) a new potent beta - adrenergic antagonist .
The compound <START:Chemical> GYKI - 41 099 <END> , as a beta - adrenergic antagonist , is 3 - 8 times more potent than <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> in vitro and in vivo .
Its antiarrhythmic effectiveness surpasses that of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> and <START:Chemical> pindolol <END> inhibiting the <START:Chemical> ouabain <END> <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> in dogs and cats .
<START:Chemical> GYKI - 41 900 <END> has a negligible cardiodepressant activity ; it is not cardioselective .
The compound shows a rapid and long lasting effect .
There was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of <START:Chemical> 14 C - 41 099 <END> to rats and dogs .
The half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours .
<START:Disease> Seizures <END> associated with <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> : case presentation and literature review .
PURPOSE : We present a case of a patient who developed <START:Disease> seizures <END> shortly after initiating treatment with <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> and to discuss the potential drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P 450 ( CYP ) 1 A 2 in this case , as well as in other cases , of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
METHODS : Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE , Cochrane and Ovid .
The main search terms utilized were case report and <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> .
The search was limited to studies published in English .
RESULTS : Six cases of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> have been reported in the literature .
Drug - drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP 1 A 2 by <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians are exhorted to pay close attention when initiating <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> therapy in patients taking medications with epileptogenic properties that are CYP 1 A 2 substrates .
Nature , time course and dose dependence of <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> - related side effects : results from the Multicenter Canadian <START:Chemical> Azidothymidine <END> Trial .
To characterize the nature , time course and dose dependency of <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> - related side effects , we undertook a multicenter , prospective , dose - range finding study .
Our study group consisted of 74 HIV - positive homosexual men belonging to groups II B , III and IV C 2 from the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) classification of <START:Disease> HIV disease <END> .
Following a 3 - week observation period , volunteers were treated with <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> 600 mg / day for 18 weeks , 900 mg / day for 9 weeks and 1200 mg / day for 9 weeks , followed by a washout period of 6 weeks after which they were re - started on 1200 mg / day or the highest tolerated dose at 8 - hourly intervals .
Subjects were randomly assigned to 4 - hourly or 8 - hourly regimens within CDC groups while taking 600 and 1200 mg / day .
Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at 3 - week intervals .
Symptomatic adverse effects were present in 96 % of subjects , most commonly <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( 64 % ) , <START:Disease> fatigue <END> ( 55 % ) and <START:Disease> headache <END> ( 49 % ) .
These were generally self - limited , reappearing briefly at each dose increment .
A decrease in hemoglobin occurred shortly after initiation of therapy .
This was not dose dependent and reversed rapidly upon discontinuation of treatment .
A red blood cell count decrease , a mean cell volume increase and a granulocyte count decrease developed early in a dose - independent fashion , reverting at least partially during the washout phase .
The decrease in reticulocyte count was dose related between 600 and 900 mg / day with no further change when the dose was escalated to 1200 mg / day .
Bone marrow changes occurred rapidly as demonstrated by <START:Disease> megaloblastosis <END> in 95 % of 65 specimens at week 18 . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
Increased sulfation and decreased 7 alpha - hydroxylation of <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> in <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> - induced <START:Disease> cholestasis <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Deoxycholic acid <END> conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> - treated rats .
Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> than <START:Chemical> taurodeoxycholic acid <END> , and both were decreased by <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> treatment .
During [ 24 - 14 C ] <START:Chemical> sodium deoxycholate <END> infusion , [ 14 C ] biliary <START:Chemical> bile acid <END> secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> - treated rats .
<START:Chemical> Ethinyl estradiol <END> - treated animals excreted significantly less 14 C as <START:Chemical> taurocholic acid <END> than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7 alpha - hydroxylation of <START:Chemical> taurodeoxycholic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ethinyl estradiol <END> treatment did not impair conjugation of <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> , but did result in an increase in sulfation of <START:Chemical> taurodeoxycholic acid <END> from 1 . 5 % in controls to nearly 4 . 0 % ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> than do certain other species .
Furthermore , the rat converts <START:Chemical> deoxycholic acid <END> , a poor choleretic , to <START:Chemical> taurocholic acid <END> , a good choleretic .
When this conversion is impaired with <START:Chemical> ethinyl estradiol <END> treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful <START:Chemical> bile acid <END> .
Diuretics , <START:Chemical> potassium <END> and <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> in <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> <START:Disease> coronary disease <END> .
It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> can alter the tendency towards <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmias <END> .
If this were so , patients with <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> might be especially susceptible .
Thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and known <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> after 8 weeks of treatment with a <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - conserving diuretic ( <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> ) and a similar period on a <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - losing diuretic ( <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> ) in a randomised study .
Plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> concentrations were on average 1 mmol / L lower during the <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> phase compared to <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> therapy .
Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and <START:Chemical> noradrenaline <END> ( <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> ) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens .
Compared to <START:Chemical> amiloride <END> treatment , the <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> phase was associated with an increased frequency of <START:Disease> ventricular ectopic beats <END> ( 24 - hour Holter monitoring ) and a higher Lown grading , increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation .
The above results indicate that because <START:Chemical> potassium <END> - losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with <START:Disease> ischaemic heart disease <END> , even minor falls in plasma <START:Chemical> potassium <END> concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients .
The safety and efficacy of combination <START:Chemical> N - butyl - deoxynojirimycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> ) and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> in patients with <START:Disease> HIV - 1 infection <END> and 200 - 500 CD 4 cells / mm 3 .
We conducted a double - blind , randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with <START:Chemical> N - butyl - deoxynojirimycin <END> ( <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> ) ( an alpha - glucosidase I inhibitor ) and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> versus <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> alone .
Patients with 200 to 500 CD 4 cells / mm 3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> therapy received <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> ( 1000 mg every 8 h ) and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( 100 mg every 8 h ) or <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> and placebo .
Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58 , <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> and placebo .
Twenty - three patients ( 38 % ) and 15 ( 26 % ) , in the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups , respectively , discontinued therapy ( p = 0 . 15 ) .
The mean <START:Chemical> SC - 48334 <END> steady - state trough level ( 4 . 04 + / - 0 . 99 micrograms / ml ) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> virus ( HIV ) .
The mean increase in CD 4 cells at week 4 was 73 . 8 cells / mm 3 and 52 . 4 cells / mm 3 for the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups , respectively ( p > 0 . 36 ) .
For patients with prior <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> therapy , the mean change in CD 4 cells in the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups was 63 . 7 cells / mm 3 and 4 . 9 cells / mm 3 at week 8 and 6 . 8 cells / mm 3 and - 45 . 1 cells / mm 3 at week 16 , respectively .
The number of patients with suppression of HIV p 24 antigenemia in the combination and <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> groups was six ( 40 % ) and two ( 11 % ) at week 4 ( p = 0 . 10 ) and five ( 45 % ) and two ( 14 % ) at week 24 ( p = 0 . 08 ) , respectively .
<START:Disease> Diarrhea <END> , <START:Disease> flatulence <END> , <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , and <START:Disease> weight loss <END> were common for combination recipients . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Disease> Hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> associated with ingestion of <START:Chemical> quinine <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> following <START:Chemical> quinine <END> ingestion is a newly described phenomenon , with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature .
We describe a 5 th case .
The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of <START:Chemical> quinine <END> .
Treatment has included use of plasma exchange , <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> , <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> , and <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> .
The patients have all regained some degree of renal function .
However , it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement .
<START:Chemical> Quinine <END> - associated <START:Disease> hemolytic - uremic syndrome <END> probably occurs more often than is recognized .
It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further <START:Chemical> quinine <END> exposure , since the reaction seems to be recurrent .
Renal function and hemodynamics during prolonged <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in humans .
The effect of <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> on glomerular function and renal blood flow was investigated in 20 human subjects .
Glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) and effective renal plasma flow ( ERPF ) were measured by inulin and <START:Chemical> para - aminohippurate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAH <END> ) clearance , respectively .
Anesthesia was maintained with <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> , <START:Chemical> nitrous oxide <END> , <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> , and <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> was induced for 236 . 9 + / - 15 . 1 min by increasing the <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59 . 8 + / - 0 . 4 mmHg .
GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Postoperatively , ERPF returned to preoperative values , whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values .
Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when <START:Disease> hypotension <END> was induced , allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow .
We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed .
Differential diagnosis of high serum <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase levels in <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> .
We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57 - year - old woman with severe <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
Since 1989 , she had been suffering from <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:Disease> SLE <END> ) with <START:Disease> renal involvement <END> and undergone periods of treatment with <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> and <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> .
Additional therapy with <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CQ <END> ) was started because of <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> .
At the same time , slightly increased <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase ( CK ) levels were noted .
<START:Disease> Myositis <END> was suspected , and the patient was treated with <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
The CK increase persisted , however , and she developed progressive <START:Disease> muscular weakness <END> and <START:Disease> muscular atrophy <END> .
Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1 , 700 U / l .
The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of <START:Disease> myositis <END> .
Thus , muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> or toxic <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
As it revealed <START:Chemical> chloroquine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , medication was stopped .
Discriminating between primary <START:Disease> SLE <END> - induced <START:Disease> affection of the musculoskeletal system <END> and drug - induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of <START:Disease> SLE <END> patients .
Effects of deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> with <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> on neuropsychological function .
The effect of deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients .
Twenty - four patients were anaesthetized for middle - ear surgery with deliberate <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> with <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> ( <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> group ) .
Seventeen patients without <START:Disease> hypotension <END> served as a control group .
The mean arterial pressure was 77 + / - 2 mmHg ( 10 . 3 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) before <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and 50 + / - 0 mmHg ( 6 . 7 + / - 0 . 0 kPa ) during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> group , and 86 + / - 2 mmHg ( 11 . 5 + / - 0 . 3 kPa ) during anaesthesia in the control group .
The following psychological tests were performed : four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( similarities , digit span , vocabulary and digit symbol ) , Trail - Making tests A and B , Zung tests ( self - rating <START:Disease> anxiety <END> scale and self - rating <START:Disease> depression <END> scale ) and two - part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall .
The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively .
There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value .
The results indicate that <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> with <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia .
Effects of the novel compound <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> ( <START:Chemical> Ro 13 - 5057 <END> ) upon <START:Disease> impaired learning and memory <END> in rodents .
The effect of <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> ( <START:Chemical> Ro 13 - 5057 <END> , <START:Chemical> 1 - anisoyl - 2 - pyrrolidinone <END> ) was studied on various forms of experimentally <START:Disease> impaired cognitive functions <END> ( learning and memory ) in rodents and produced the following effects : ( 1 ) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal <START:Disease> hypercapnia <END> immediately before the acquisition session ; ( 2 ) partial ( rats ) or complete ( mice ) prevention of the <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced short - term <START:Disease> amnesia <END> for a passive avoidance task ; ( 3 ) complete protection against <START:Disease> amnesia <END> for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition ; ( 4 ) prevention of the long - term retention - or retrieval - deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> or <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> administered immediately after acquisition ; ( 5 ) reversal , when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test , of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by <START:Chemical> cycloheximide <END> injected 2 days previously ; ( 6 ) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or <START:Disease> hypercapnia <END> applied immediately before retrieval testing ( 24 h after acquisition ) .
These improvements or normalizations of <START:Disease> impaired cognitive functions <END> were seen at oral <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> doses of 10 - 100 mg / kg .
Generally , the dose - response curves were bell - shaped .
The mechanisms underlying the activity of <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> and its ' therapeutic window ' are unknown .
<START:Chemical> Piracetam <END> , another <START:Chemical> pyrrolidinone <END> derivative was used for comparison .
It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one - tenth the potency of <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> .
The results indicate that <START:Chemical> aniracetam <END> improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process .
<START:Chemical> Fluconazole <END> - induced <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To present a case of <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> - associated <START:Disease> torsade de pointes <END> ( <START:Disease> TDP <END> ) and discuss <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> ' s role in causing <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 68 - year - old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed <START:Disease> TDP <END> eight days after commencing oral <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> The patient had no other risk factors for <START:Disease> TDP <END> , including <START:Disease> coronary artery disease <END> , <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> , and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> and <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
The <START:Disease> TDP <END> resolved when <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> was discontinued ; however , the patient continued to have <START:Disease> premature ventricular contractions <END> and nonsustained <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( <START:Disease> NSVT <END> ) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION : Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> and the development of <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
The possible mechanism is <START:Disease> depression <END> of rapidly activating delayed rectifier <START:Chemical> potassium <END> currents .
In our patient , there was no other etiology identified that could explain <START:Disease> QT prolongation <END> or <START:Disease> TDP <END> The complete disappearance of <START:Disease> NSVT <END> and <START:Disease> premature ventricular contractions <END> followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> as the etiology .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware that <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> , even at low doses , may cause <START:Disease> prolongation of the QT interval <END> , leading to <START:Disease> TDP <END> .
Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when <START:Chemical> fluconazole <END> is administered in patients who are at risk for <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypomania <END> - like syndrome induced by <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> .
We report a female patient with a diagnosis of a not otherwise specified <START:Disease> psychotic disorder <END> ( DSM - IV ) who developed <START:Disease> hypomania <END> shortly after the introduction of <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> treatment .
Effect of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> on hepatic and brain cytochrome P 450 s and influence of P 450 modulation in <START:Chemical> lindane <END> induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> ( 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 and 15 mg / kg , body weight ) for 5 days was found to produce a dose - dependent increase in the activity of P 450 dependent 7 - ethoxyresorufin - O - deethylase ( EROD ) , 7 - pentoxyresorufin - O - dealkylase ( PROD ) and <START:Chemical> N - nitrosodimethylamine <END> demethylase ( <START:Chemical> NDMA <END> - d ) in rat brain and liver .
A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P 450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose ( 2 . 5 mg / kg ) of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days .
As observed with different doses , the magnitude of induction in the activity of P 450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain .
Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P 450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P 450 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 , 2 B 1 / 2 B 2 and 2 E 1 isoenzymes .
In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P 450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD , EROD and <START:Chemical> NDMA <END> - d are due to the increase in the levels of P 450 2 B 1 / 2 B 2 , 1 A 1 / 1 A 2 and 2 E 1 isoenzymes , respectively .
Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of <START:Chemical> 3 - methylcholanthrene <END> ( <START:Chemical> MC <END> ) , an inducer of P 4501 A 1 / 1 A 2 , did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> , pretreatment with <START:Chemical> phenobarbital <END> ( PB ) , an inducer of P 450 2 B 1 / 2 B 2 or <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> , an inducer of P 450 2 E 1 catalysed reactions , significantly increased the incidence of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Similarly , when the P 450 - mediated metabolism of <START:Chemical> lindane <END> was blocked by <START:Chemical> cobalt chloride <END> incidence of <START:Disease> convulsions <END> was increased in animals treated with <START:Chemical> lindane <END> indicating that <START:Chemical> lindane <END> per se or its metabolites formed by PB or <START:Chemical> ethanol <END> inducible P 450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> PTU <END> - associated <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> in a girl with <START:Disease> Turner Syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> Graves ' disease <END> .
Palpable <START:Disease> purpura <END> is a concerning clinical finding in pediatric patients and can have many causes , including infectious and autoimmune processes .
A rare cause , drug - induced <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> , may result from the production of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies ( ANCAs ) in response to a medication .
We report a girl with <START:Disease> Turner syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> Graves ' disease <END> who presented with palpable <START:Disease> purpuric lesions <END> .
The diagnosis of <START:Chemical> propylthiouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTU <END> ) - associated <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> was made by observation of consistent clinical features , the detection of elevated ANA and ANCA in the blood , and the observed clinical resolution of symptoms following withdrawal of <START:Chemical> PTU <END> .
Subsequent treatment of persistent <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> with radioablation did not result in an exacerbation of the <START:Disease> vasculitis <END> , a complication described in prior case reports .
Chronic <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> inhibits the development of local anesthetic <START:Disease> seizures <END> kindled by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> carbamazepine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> ) treatment on local anesthetic - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> administration .
Chronic oral <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> inhibited the development of both <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Chronic <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> also decreased the incidence of <START:Disease> seizure <END> - related mortality in the <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - injected rats .
Acute <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> over a range of doses ( 15 - 50 mg / kg ) had no effect on completed <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - kindled or acute <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Repeated i . p . injection of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> ( 15 mg / kg ) also was without effect on the development of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - or <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The differential effects of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> depending upon stage of <START:Disease> seizure <END> development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic - kindled <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated , intermittent injections of <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens .
The possible utility of chronic <START:Chemical> CBZ <END> in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> users is suggested by these data , but remains to be directly evaluated .
Some central effects of repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
We investigated the effect of repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> , a selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> uptake inhibitor , on behavioral effects of dopaminomimetics and <START:Chemical> methoxamine <END> and on the animal behavior in the " behavioral despair " test .
A repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> ( twice daily for 14 days ) potentiated in mice and in rats ( weaker ) the <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
The <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> nomifensine <END> in mice remained unaffected by <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
The stimulation of locomotor activity by intracerebroventricularly administered <START:Chemical> methoxamine <END> was not affected by repeated treatment with <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
Given three times <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> had no effect on the immobilization time in the " behavioral despair " test in rats .
The results indicate that <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> given repeatedly acts differently than <START:Chemical> citalopram <END> , another selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> uptake inhibitor , and differs also from other antidepressant drugs .
<START:Disease> Cardiac arrest <END> in a child with <START:Disease> cerebral palsy <END> undergoing <START:Chemical> sevoflurane <END> induction of anesthesia after preoperative <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Clonidine <END> is a frequently administered alpha 2 - adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure .
We present a case of a 5 - year - old child with <START:Disease> cerebral palsy <END> and <START:Disease> seizure disorder <END> , receiving <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> for <START:Disease> restlessness <END> , who presented for placement of a <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> pump .
Without the knowledge of the medical personnel , the patient ' s mother administered three doses of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce <START:Disease> anxiety <END> .
During induction of anesthesia , the patient developed <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> and <START:Disease> hypotension <END> requiring cardiac resuscitation .
There are no previous reports of <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> - associated <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia .
Delayed - onset <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> presents 5 to 12 days after <START:Chemical> heparin <END> exposure , with or without <START:Disease> arterial or venous thromboemboli <END> .
Delayed recognition and treatment of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> contribute to poor patient outcomes .
OBJECTIVE : To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> are delayed .
DESIGN : Retrospective case series .
SETTING : Three large urban hospitals ( with active cardiovascular surgery programs ) .
PATIENTS : 14 patients seen over a 3 - year period in whom <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> became apparent on delayed presentation with <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> complications .
MEASUREMENTS : Platelet counts , onset of objectively determined <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> , results of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests , and outcomes .
RESULTS : Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included <START:Chemical> heparin <END> exposure -- in most cases , with no <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> recognized -- only to return to the hospital ( median , day 14 ) with <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> complications .
<START:Disease> Thromboemboli <END> were venous ( 12 patients , 7 with <START:Disease> pulmonary emboli <END> ) or arterial ( 4 patients ) or both .
Platelet counts were mildly decreased in all but 2 patients on second presentation .
On readmission , 11 patients received therapeutic <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , which worsened the patients ' clinical condition and , in all 11 cases , decreased the platelet count ( mean at readmission , 143 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ; mean nadir after <START:Chemical> heparin <END> re - exposure , 39 x 10 ( 9 ) cells / L ) .
Results of serologic tests for <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced antibodies were positive in all patients .
Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants ( 11 patients ) , thrombolytic drugs ( 3 patients ) , inferior vena cava filters ( 3 patients ) and , eventually , <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> ( 11 patients ) .
Three patients died .
CONCLUSIONS : Delayed - onset <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> is increasingly being recognized .
To avoid disastrous outcomes , physicians must consider <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> ; therapy with alternative anticoagulants , not <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , should be initiated .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor - associated <START:Disease> angioedema <END> of the stomach and small intestine : a case report .
This is a case report on a 45 - year old African - American female with newly diagnosed <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , who was started on a combination pill of <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> / <START:Chemical> benazapril <END> 10 / 5 mg .
The very next day , she presented at the emergency room ( ER ) with <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> .
Physical exam , complete metabolic panel , and hemogram were in the normal range .
She was discharged from the ER after a few hours of treatment with fluid and analgesics .
However , she returned to the ER the next day with the same complaints .
This time the physical exam was significant for a distended abdomen with dullness to percussion .
CT scan of the abdomen revealed markedly thickened antrum of the stomach , duodenum and jejunum , along with fluid in the abdominal and pelvic cavity .
Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) - induced <START:Disease> angioedema <END> was suspected , and anti - <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> medications were discontinued .
Her symptoms improved within the next 24 hours , and repeat CT after 72 hours revealed marked improvement in stomach and small bowel thickening and resolution of <START:Disease> ascites <END> .
The recognition of <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme ( ACE ) and <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> receptor blocker ( ARB ) <START:Disease> intestinal angioedema <END> constitutes a challenge to primary care physicians , internists , emergency room personal and surgeons .
<START:Disease> Hyperglycemic acidotic coma <END> and death in <START:Disease> Kearns - Sayre syndrome <END> .
This paper presents the clinical and metabolic findings in two young boys with long - standing <START:Disease> Kearns - Sayre syndrome <END> .
Following short exposure to oral <START:Chemical> prednisone <END> , both boys developed <START:Disease> lethargy <END> , increasing <START:Disease> somnolence <END> , <START:Disease> polydipsia <END> , <START:Disease> polyphagia <END> , and <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
Both presented in the emergency room with profound <START:Disease> coma <END> , <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , severe <START:Disease> hyperglycemia <END> , and <START:Disease> acidosis <END> .
Nonketotic <START:Disease> lactic acidosis <END> was present in one and <START:Disease> ketosis <END> without a known serum <START:Chemical> lactate <END> level was present in the other .
<START:Disease> Respiratory failure <END> rapidly ensued and both patients expired in spite of efforts at resuscitation .
We believe these two cases represent a newly described and catastrophic <START:Disease> metabolic - endocrine failure <END> in the <START:Disease> Kearns - Sayre syndrome <END> .
<START:Disease> Acute liver failure <END> with concurrent <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> therapy .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of fatal <START:Disease> liver failure <END> possibly associated with concurrent use of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> and <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 41 - year - old Chinese man with a history of <START:Disease> hyperthyroidism <END> had been treated with <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> and <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> for the past 5 years .
He received a 10 - day course of <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> as an aid for smoking cessation 10 weeks prior to presentation .
He developed <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> with rapid deterioration of renal function .
Liver biopsy showed evidence of nonspecific <START:Disease> drug - induced acute liver injury <END> .
His condition was further complicated by <START:Disease> sepsis <END> and <START:Disease> coagulopathy <END> .
Death resulted 19 days after the onset of symptoms .
The likelihood that <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> induced <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> in our patient was possible , based on the Naranjo probability scale .
DISCUSSION : Although there is increasing evidence of <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> , this is the first case of fatality that could have resulted from <START:Disease> acute liver failure <END> in a patient receiving <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> while on concomitant treatment with <START:Chemical> carbimazole <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of <START:Disease> acute liver insult <END> induced by <START:Chemical> bupropion <END> given concurrently with other <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> drugs .
Multicenter , double - blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups efficacy and safety trial of <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> , <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine <END> , and placebo in the treatment of <START:Disease> spring allergic rhinitis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Azelastine <END> , a novel antiallergic medication , was compared with <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine maleate <END> and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of <START:Disease> spring allergic rhinitis <END> in a multicenter , double - blind , multiple - dose , parallel - groups study .
One hundred fifty - five subjects participated .
Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2 - year history of <START:Disease> spring allergic rhinitis <END> , confirmed by positive skin test to spring aeroallergens .
Medications were given four times daily ; the <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> groups received 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , or 2 . 0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon ; the <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine <END> group received 4 . 0 mg four times daily .
Daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4 - week treatment period while subjects received study medications .
Individual symptoms , total symptoms , and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medication .
Elicited , volunteered , and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among groups .
Vital signs , body weights , serum chemistry values , complete blood cell counts , urine studies , and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among groups .
Symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> ( 2 . 0 mg twice daily ) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the study .
Lower doses of <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the study .
In contrast , although the <START:Chemical> chlorpheniramine <END> group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study , the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the study .
There were no serious side effects in any of the treatment groups .
<START:Disease> Drowsiness <END> and <START:Disease> altered taste perception <END> were increased significantly over placebo only in the high - dose <START:Chemical> azelastine <END> group .
<START:Chemical> Azelastine <END> appears to be a safe , efficacious medication for <START:Disease> seasonal allergic rhinitis <END> .
Remodelling of nerve structure in experimental <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> in the rat .
The <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> caused by a single dose of <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> in rats was studied with a computer - assisted morphometric method .
Scatter diagrams of the g ratio ( quotient fibre diameter / axon diameter ) define regenerating fibres as a distinct population , distinguishable from the surviving fibres by reduced sheath thickness and reduced axon calibre .
There was also evidence of a subtle direct toxic effect on the entire fibre population , causing axon shrinkage masked by readjustment of the myelin sheath .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> D 2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic drugs .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) , through D 1 / D 2 receptor - mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of <START:Disease> epileptic seizures <END> arising in the limbic system .
<START:Disease> Excitotoxicity <END> leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of <START:Disease> seizures <END> at the cellular level .
In this respect , little is known about the role of <START:Chemical> DA <END> receptors in the occurrence of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - induced neuronal cell death .
Here we analyze the occurrence of <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> in D 2 R - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
We compared these results with those previously obtained with <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> KA <END> ) , a potent <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> agonist .
Importantly , D 2 R - / - mice develop <START:Disease> seizures <END> at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
However , <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D 2 R - / - brains in comparison to <START:Chemical> KA <END> .
Thus , the absence of D 2 R lowers the threshold for <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by both <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> and <START:Chemical> acetylcholine <END> .
Moreover , the dopaminergic control of <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurodegeneration <END> seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D 2 R signaling with these two neurotransmitters .
<START:Disease> Hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> in terminal <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients treated with continuous intravenous <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Eight <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous <START:Chemical> morphine <END> developed <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> .
All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen .
Five patients developed universal <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> hyperesthesia <END> which in 2 cases were accompanied by <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> .
In 3 patients a pre - existing <START:Disease> neuralgia <END> increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> occurred simultaneously .
Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between <START:Disease> hyperalgesia <END> / <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> and high doses of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> are available , experimental support from animal studies indicates that <START:Chemical> morphine <END> , or its metabolites , plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome .
The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations .
Initial <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss and <START:Disease> hypokalaemia <END> during <START:Chemical> chlorthalidone <END> administration in patients with essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> : the influence of dietary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> restriction .
To investigate the initial <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss and development of <START:Disease> hypokalaemia <END> during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> who had shown <START:Disease> hypokalaemia <END> under prior oral diuretic treatment .
<START:Chemical> Chlorthalidone <END> ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 days .
Six patients received a normal - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> diet and four a low - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> ( 17 mmol / day ) diet .
All patients had a normal initial total body <START:Chemical> potassium <END> ( 40 K ) .
The electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> secretion rate were measured .
In both groups a <START:Chemical> potassium <END> deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment .
In the normal - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group the highest mean <START:Chemical> potassium <END> deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some <START:Chemical> potassium <END> was regained ; in the low - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13 .
The normal - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> levels ; in the low - <START:Chemical> sodium <END> group renin and <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> increased more slowly but remained elevated .
It is concluded that dietary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> restriction increases diuretic - induced <START:Chemical> potassium <END> loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - <START:Chemical> aldosterone <END> system , while <START:Chemical> sodium <END> delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased <START:Chemical> potassium <END> secretion .
<START:Disease> Toxicity <END> due to remission inducing drugs in <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
Association with HLA - B 35 and Cw 4 antigens .
Twenty - five patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RA <END> ) who developed <START:Disease> toxicity <END> while taking remission inducing drugs and 30 without <START:Disease> toxicity <END> were studied for possible associations with class I and II HLA antigens .
A strong association has been found between <START:Disease> nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> Tiopronin <END> ( a <START:Chemical> D - Penicillamine <END> like compound ) and class I antigens B 35 - Cw 4 , and between <START:Disease> dermatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> gold <END> <START:Chemical> thiosulphate <END> and B 35 .
Compared to healthy controls a lower DR 5 frequency was observed in patients with <START:Disease> RA <END> except for the <START:Chemical> Tiopronin <END> related <START:Disease> nephritis <END> group .
The role of nitrergic system in <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsion <END> in the mouse .
The effects of <START:Chemical> N - nitro - L - arginine - methyl ester <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ) a <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) synthase inhibitor and <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> , a <START:Chemical> NO <END> precursor , were investigated on <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
In the first experiment , four groups of mice received physiological saline ( 0 . 9 % ) , <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> ( 300 mg / kg , i . p . ) , <START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 2 mg / kg ) , respectively .
Thirty minutes after these injections , all mice received <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 50 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
In the second experiment , four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment , and 30 min after these injections , all mice received a higher dose of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 80 mg / kg ) .
<START:Chemical> L - NAME <END> ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 2 mg / kg ) significantly decreased the incidence of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 50 mg / kg ) - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
In contrast , the <START:Chemical> L - arginine <END> treatment increased the incidence of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> ( 80 mg / kg , i . p . ) - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> significantly .
These results may suggest that <START:Chemical> NO <END> is a proconvulsant mediator in <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Prevention of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> with <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> : preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women .
Italian <START:Chemical> Tamoxifen <END> Prevention Study .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Tamoxifen <END> is a candidate chemopreventive agent in <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , although the drug may be associated with the development of <START:Disease> endometrial cancer <END> .
Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> as a chemopreventive .
METHODS : In October , 1992 , we started a double - blind placebo - controlled , randomised trial of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> in women ( mainly in Italy ) who did not have <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> and who had had a hysterectomy .
Women were randomised to receive <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> 20 mg per day or placebo , both orally for 5 years .
The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years ' follow - up .
In June , 1997 , the trialists and the data - monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study .
Recruitment ended on July 11 , 1997 , and the study will continue as planned .
The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention - to - treat .
FINDINGS : 5408 women were randomised ; participating women have a median follow - up of 46 months for major endpoints .
41 cases of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> occurred so far ; there have been no deaths from <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
There is no difference in <START:Disease> breast - cancer <END> frequency between the placebo ( 22 cases ) and <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> ( 19 ) arms .
There is a statistically significant reduction of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> among women receiving <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> who also used hormone - replacement therapy during the trial : among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo , we found eight cases of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> compared with one case among 362 women allocated to <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
Compared with the placebo group , there was a significantly increased risk of <START:Disease> vascular events <END> and <START:Disease> hypertriglyceridaemia <END> among women on <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
INTERPRETATION : Although this preliminary analysis has low power , in this cohort of women at low - to - normal risk of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> , the postulated protective effects of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> are not yet apparent .
Women using hormone - replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> .
There were no deaths from <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> recorded in women in the study .
It is essential to continue follow - up to quantify the long - term risks and benefits of <START:Chemical> tamoxifen <END> therapy .
Cortical motor overactivation in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients with <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> - induced peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) changes induced by the execution of a finger - to - thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients on <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> medication , the first one without <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> ( n = 23 ) and the other with moderate peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> ( n = 15 ) , and of a group of 14 normal subjects .
Single photon emission tomography with i . v . 133 Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes .
The <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non - <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> patients , with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi - and contralateral primary motor areas .
These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an <START:Disease> hyperkinetic <END> <START:Disease> abnormal involuntary movement <END> , like <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> - induced peak dose <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> , is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop .
Transketolase abnormality in <START:Chemical> tolazamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> .
We studied a <START:Chemical> thiamine <END> - dependent enzyme , transketolase , from fibroblasts of a <START:Disease> diabetic <END> patient who developed <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> when treated with <START:Chemical> tolazamide <END> , in order to delineate if this patient also had transketolase abnormality [ high Km for <START:Chemical> thiamine pyrophosphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> TPP <END> ) ] , as previously reported in postalcoholic <START:Disease> Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome <END> .
In addition to this patient , we also studied this enzyme from three <START:Disease> diabetic <END> kindreds without any history of <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> and from four normal controls .
We found that the above - mentioned patient and one of the <START:Disease> diabetic <END> kindreds with no history of <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> had abnormal transketolase as determined by its Km for <START:Chemical> TPP <END> .
These data suggest a similarity between postalcoholic <START:Disease> Wernicke - Korsakoff syndrome <END> and the patient with <START:Chemical> tolazamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Wernicke ' s encephalopathy <END> from the standpoint of transketolase abnormality .
<START:Disease> Brainstem dysgenesis <END> in an infant prenatally exposed to <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
Many authors described the effects on the fetus of maternal <START:Disease> cocaine abuse <END> during pregnancy .
Vasoconstriction appears to be the common mechanism of action leading to a wide range of <START:Disease> fetal anomalies <END> .
We report on an infant with <START:Disease> multiple cranial - nerve involvement <END> attributable to <START:Disease> brainstem dysgenesis <END> , born to a <START:Disease> cocaine - addicted <END> mother .
Midline B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> nerves in rat medulla are involved in <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> effect of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> .
Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> onto the ventrolateral cells of the B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> neurons in the medulla elicits a <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord .
The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> neurons in the medulla , coinciding with the raphe magnus .
In spontaneously <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> , <START:Disease> stroke <END> - prone rats , microinjection of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> into the area of the midline B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent <START:Disease> hypotension <END> of 30 - 40 mm Hg , which was maximal 2 - 3 h after administration and was abolished by the <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> neurotoxin <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - dihydroxytryptamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DHT <END> ) injected intracerebroventricularly .
However , intraspinal injection of <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DHT <END> to produce a more selective lesion of only descending <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> projections in the spinal cord did not affect this <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Further , <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DHT <END> lesion of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle , one of the main ascending pathways from the B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> cells , did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B 3 <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> injection .
It is concluded therefore that , unlike the ventrolateral B 3 cells which mediate a <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> via descending projections , the midline <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> B 3 cells in the medulla contribute to the <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> action of <START:Chemical> methyldopa <END> , either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle , or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem .
<START:Chemical> Lamotrigine <END> associated with exacerbation or de novo <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> in <START:Disease> idiopathic generalized epilepsies <END> .
Five patients with <START:Disease> idiopathic generalized epilepsies <END> ( <START:Disease> IGE <END> ) treated with <START:Chemical> lamotrigine <END> ( <START:Chemical> LTG <END> ) experienced exacerbation or de novo appearance of <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> ( <START:Disease> MJ <END> ) .
In three patients , <START:Chemical> LTG <END> exacerbated <START:Disease> MJ <END> in a dose - dependent manner with early aggravation during titration .
<START:Disease> MJ <END> disappeared when <START:Chemical> LTG <END> dose was decreased by 25 to 50 % .
In two patients , <START:Chemical> LTG <END> exacerbated <START:Disease> MJ <END> in a delayed but more severe manner , with <START:Disease> myoclonic status <END> that only ceased after <START:Chemical> LTG <END> withdrawal .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> treatment ameliorates acute <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in mice .
The nephroprotective effect of <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> was investigated in mice with <START:Disease> acute renal injury <END> induced by a single i . p . injection of <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> ( 5 mg / kg ) .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> treatment ( 10 mg / kg / day , i . p . ) was applied for 6 consecutive days , starting 1 day before <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> administration .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> significantly reduced <START:Chemical> blood urea nitrogen <END> and serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels which were increased by <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> .
<START:Chemical> Coenzyme Q 10 <END> significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms ( <START:Chemical> reduced glutathione <END> level and <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase activity ) , suppressed lipid peroxidation , decreased the elevations of <START:Disease> tumor <END> <START:Disease> necrosis <END> factor - alpha , <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> and <START:Chemical> platinum <END> ion concentration , and attenuated the reductions of <START:Chemical> selenium <END> and <START:Chemical> zinc <END> ions in renal tissue resulted from <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> administration .
Also , histopathological <START:Disease> renal tissue damage <END> mediated by <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> was ameliorated by <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> treatment .
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> significantly decreased the <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> - induced overexpression of inducible <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase , nuclear factor - kappaB , caspase - 3 and p 53 in renal tissue .
It was concluded that <START:Chemical> coenzyme Q 10 <END> represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute <START:Chemical> cisplatin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> commonly encountered in clinical practice .
Induction by <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> of <START:Disease> bladder and liver tumours <END> in the rat .
Effects on hepatocyte fine structure .
Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0 . 5 % or 1 . 0 % <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> by weight for up to 18 months .
At the 1 . 0 % dosage level , 20 % of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver , a statistically significant incidence .
These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration , the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats .
<START:Disease> Papillomas <END> of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - treated groups , and three rats bore <START:Disease> bladder carcinomas <END> .
However , significant yields of <START:Disease> bladder tumours <END> were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males .
Additionally , 20 to 25 % of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - treated rats developed <START:Disease> hyperplasia <END> of the bladder epithelium , which was not coincident with the presence of <START:Disease> bladder calculi <END> .
A low yield of <START:Disease> tumours <END> at various other sites also arose following <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> feeding .
An electron microscope study of the livers of <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> - treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known <START:Disease> hepatocarcinogens <END> .
Two prodrugs of potent and selective GluR 5 <START:Chemical> kainate <END> receptor antagonists actives in three animal models of <START:Disease> pain <END> .
Amino acids 5 and 7 , two potent and selective competitive GluR 5 <START:Chemical> KA <END> receptor antagonists , exhibited high GluR 5 receptor affinity over other <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> receptors .
Their ester prodrugs 6 and 8 were orally active in three models of <START:Disease> pain <END> : reversal of <START:Chemical> formalin <END> - induced paw licking , <START:Chemical> carrageenan <END> - induced <START:Disease> thermal hyperalgesia <END> , and <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> mechanical hyperalgesia <END> .
Intracavitary chemotherapy ( <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> / <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> liquid crystalline cubic phases ) for recurrent <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> -- clinical observations .
Human malignant <START:Disease> brain tumors <END> have a poor prognosis in spite of surgery and radiation therapy .
Cubic phases consist of curved biocontinuous lipid bilayers , separating two congruent networks of water channels .
Used as a host for cytotoxic drugs , the gel - like matrix can easily be applied to the walls of a surgical resection cavity .
For human <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> recurrences , the feasibility , safety , and short - term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study .
A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> multiforme underwent re - resection and received an intracavitary application of <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> cubic phases in different dosages .
Six of the patients received more than 15 mg <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> and suffered from moderate to severe <START:Disease> brain edema <END> , while the remaining patients received only a total of 15 mg <START:Chemical> paclitaxel <END> .
In the latter group , <START:Disease> brain edema <END> was markedly reduced and dealt medically .
Intracavitary chemotherapy in recurrent <START:Disease> glioblastoma <END> using cubic phases is feasible and safe , yet the clinical benefit remains to be examined in a clinical phase II study .
Urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with <START:Disease> overactive bladder <END> after <START:Chemical> tolterodine <END> treatment .
OBJECTIVES : To study the urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with <START:Disease> overactive bladder <END> ( <START:Disease> OAB <END> ) after <START:Chemical> tolterodine <END> treatment .
MATERIAL AND METHOD : Thirty women ( aged 30 - 77 years ) diagnosed as having <START:Disease> OAB <END> at the Gynecology Clinic , King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital from January to April 2004 were included in the present study .
<START:Chemical> Tolterodine <END> 2 mg , twice daily was given .
After 8 weeks treatment , changes in micturition diary variables and tolerability were determined .
Short form 36 ( SF 36 ) questionaires ( Thai version ) were given before and after 8 weeks of treatment .
RESULTS : At 8 weeks , all micturition per day decreased from 16 . 7 + / - 5 . 3 to 6 . 7 + / - 2 . 4 times per day .
The number of <START:Disease> nocturia <END> episodes decreased from 5 . 4 + / - 4 . 2 to 1 . 1 + / - 1 . 0 times per night .
The most common side effect was <START:Disease> dry month <END> in 5 cases ( 16 . 7 % ) with 2 cases reporting a moderate degree and 1 case with severe degree .
Only one case ( 3 . 3 % ) withdrew from the present study due to a severe <START:Disease> dry mouth <END> .
The SF - 36 scores changed significantly in the domains of physical functioning , role function emotional , social function and mental heath .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Tolterodine <END> was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
Aging process of epithelial cells of the rat prostate lateral lobe in experimental <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
The aim of the study was to examine the influence of <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> , induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( <START:Chemical> HAL <END> ) on age related morphology and function changes of epithelial cells in rat prostate lateral lobe .
The study was performed on sexually mature male rats .
Serum concentrations of prolactin ( <START:Chemical> PRL <END> ) and <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> T <END> ) were measured .
Tissue sections were evaluated with light and electron microscopy .
Immunohistochemical reactions for Anti - Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen ( PCNA ) were performed .
In rats of the experimental group , the mean concentration of : <START:Chemical> PRL <END> was more than twice higher , whereas <START:Chemical> T <END> concentration was almost twice lower than that in the control group .
Light microscopy visualized the following : <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> and epithelium <START:Disease> hyperplasia <END> of the glandular ducts , associated with increased PCNA expression .
Electron microscopy revealed changes in columnar epithelial cells , concerning organelles , engaged in protein synthesis and secretion .
Long - term <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment and the kidney .
Interim report on fifty patients .
This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long - term <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment on the kidney .
<START:Chemical> Creatinine <END> clearance , maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long - term <START:Chemical> lithium <END> for more than one year .
These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> , available for most of our patients .
No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre - <START:Chemical> lithium <END> values .
Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients .
The concentration defect appeared reversible , at least in part .
<START:Disease> Polyuria <END> above 3 litres / 24 hours was found in 10 % of patients .
An attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings .
Development of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiac hypertrophy <END> .
The development of <START:Disease> cardiac hypertrophy <END> was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> ( <START:Chemical> ISO <END> ) ( 0 . 3 mg / kg body weight ) .
A time course was established for the change in tissue mass , RNA and DNA content , as well as <START:Chemical> hydroxyproline <END> content .
Heart weight increased 44 % after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3 . 4 days .
Ventricular RNA content was elevated 26 % after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therapy .
The half time for RNA accumulation was 2 . 0 days .
The total content of <START:Chemical> hydroxyproline <END> remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46 % after 4 days of therapy .
Ventricular DNA content was unchanged during the early stage ( 1 - 4 days ) of <START:Disease> hypertrophic <END> growth but increased to a new steady - state level 19 % above the controls after 8 days of treatment .
Intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> .
However , dP / dt in the <START:Chemical> ISO <END> - treated hearts was slightly but significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) elevated .
These data indicate that the adaptive response to <START:Chemical> ISO <END> shows an early <START:Disease> hypertrophic <END> phase ( 1 - 4 days ) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA .
However , prolonged stimulation ( 8 - 12 days ) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> and <START:Disease> hyperplasia <END> within the heart .
<START:Disease> Serotonin syndrome <END> from <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> - <START:Chemical> tranylcypromine <END> interaction .
Excessive stimulation of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 5 HT 1 A receptors causes a syndrome of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> excess that consists of shivering , <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> salivation <END> , <START:Disease> confusion <END> , <START:Disease> agitation <END> and <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> .
The most common cause of this syndrome is an interaction between a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) and a specific <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor .
<START:Chemical> Venlafaxine <END> is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> and <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> .
We report a <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> - MAOI interaction that resulted in the <START:Disease> serotonin syndrome <END> in a 23 - y - old male who was taking <START:Chemical> tranylcypromine <END> for <START:Disease> depression <END> .
He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1 / 2 tab of <START:Chemical> venlafaxine <END> .
Within 2 h he became confused with jerking movements of his extremities , <START:Disease> tremors <END> and <START:Disease> rigidity <END> .
He was brought directly to a hospital where he was found to be agitated and confused with shivering , <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> , <START:Disease> rigidity <END> , <START:Disease> salivation <END> and diaphoresis .
His pupils were 7 mm and sluggishly reactive to light .
Vital signs were : blood pressure 120 / 67 mm Hg , heart rate 127 / min , respiratory rate 28 / min , and temperature 97 F . After 180 mg of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> i . v . he remained tremulous with <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> and clenched jaws .
He was intubated for airway protection and because of <START:Disease> hypoventilation <END> , and was <START:Disease> paralyzed <END> to control <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> .
His subsequent course was remarkable for non - immune <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> which resolved .
The patient ' s maximal temperature was 101 . 2 F and his CPK remained < 500 units / L with no other evidence of <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> .
His mental status normalized and he was transferred to a psychiatry ward .
This patient survived without sequelae due to the aggressive sedation and neuromuscular <START:Disease> paralysis <END> .
<START:Chemical> 22 - oxacalcitriol <END> suppresses <START:Disease> secondary hyperparathyroidism <END> without inducing <START:Disease> low bone turnover <END> in dogs with <START:Disease> renal failure <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Calcitriol <END> therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) in patients with <START:Disease> renal failure <END> but has several drawbacks , including <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and / or marked <START:Disease> suppression of bone turnover <END> , which may lead to <START:Disease> adynamic bone disease <END> .
A new <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> analogue , <START:Chemical> 22 - oxacalcitriol <END> ( <START:Chemical> OCT <END> ) , has been shown to have promising characteristics .
This study was undertaken to determine the effects of <START:Chemical> OCT <END> on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or <START:Disease> impaired renal function <END> .
METHODS : Sixty dogs were either nephrectomized ( Nx , N = 38 ) or sham - operated ( Sham , N = 22 ) .
The animals received supplemental <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> to enhance PTH secretion .
Fourteen weeks after the start of <START:Chemical> phosphate <END> supplementation , half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of <START:Chemical> OCT <END> ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks .
Thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight months .
Biochemical and hormonal indices of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after <START:Chemical> OCT <END> or vehicle treatment , and at the end of the crossover period .
RESULTS : In Nx dogs , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> .
In long - standing <START:Disease> secondary hyperparathyroidism <END> , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> ( 0 . 03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months .
Serum PTH levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in Nx control .
These effects were accompanied by episodes of <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and <START:Disease> hyperphosphatemia <END> .
In animals with normal renal function , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0 . 1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the doses .
In Nx dogs , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> reversed abnormal bone formation , such as <START:Disease> woven osteoid <END> and <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> , but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover .
In addition , <START:Chemical> OCT <END> improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid mineralizes ) in both Nx and Sham dogs .
CONCLUSIONS : These results indicate that even though <START:Chemical> OCT <END> does not completely prevent the occurrence of <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> in experimental dogs with <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> , it may be of use in the management of <START:Disease> secondary hyperparathyroidism <END> because it does not induce <START:Disease> low bone turnover <END> and , therefore , does not increase the risk of <START:Disease> adynamic bone disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ciprofloxacin <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> autoimmune hemolytic anemia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ciprofloxacin <END> has been associated with several side effects including <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> hemolytic anemia <END> .
The combination of both side effects is extremely rare .
In this report , we describe a case of <START:Chemical> ciprofloxacin <END> - induced <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> and <START:Disease> autoimmune hemolytic anemia <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemolytic anemia <END> improved after stopping the drug and initiation of <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy .
Unfortunately , acute <START:Disease> interstitial nephritis <END> was irreversible and the patient developed <START:Disease> end - stage renal disease <END> .
Increased <START:Disease> mental slowing <END> associated with the APOE epsilon 4 allele after <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> oral anticholinergic challenge in healthy elderly .
OBJECTIVES : The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between APOE epsilon 4 and subjective effects of <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> on measures reflecting sedation and <START:Disease> confusion <END> and to investigate the relationship between <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> - induced subjective effects and objective memory performance .
METHODS : This study comprised 24 cognitively intact , health elderly adults ( 12 APOE epsilon 4 carriers ) at an outpatient geriatric psychiatry research clinic .
This was a randomized , double blind , placebo - controlled , three - way , crossover experimental design .
All participants received 1 . 0 mg or 2 . 0 mg <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> or placebo administered in counterbalanced sequences over a period of three consecutive weeks .
Bond and Lader ' s visual analog scales and alternate versions of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test were administered in a repeated measures design at baseline , 1 , 2 . 5 , and 5 hours postdrug administration .
RESULTS : A 2 . 0 - mg oral dose of <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> resulted in increased subjective ratings of <START:Disease> mental slowness <END> in carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 allele only .
Drug effects as determined by difference scores between 2 . 0 mg <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> and placebo on ratings of <START:Disease> mental slowness <END> significantly correlated with total and delayed recall on the Buschke Selective Reminding Test in carriers of the APOE epsilon 4 allele only .
However , no significant effects were found with other visual analog scales reflecting subjective sedation and clear - headedness .
CONCLUSION : The epsilon 4 allele in healthy elderly was associated with increased subjective <START:Disease> mental slowing <END> after <START:Chemical> trihexyphenidyl <END> anticholinergic challenge .
Plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> induced in the rat by <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> .
This study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> induced by <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> were due to <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> per se , or , at least in part , to the <START:Chemical> aminonucleoside <END> .
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days ) and the subsequent development of <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Since massive <START:Disease> albuminuria <END> occurred after 6 days of treatment , the time - course study was divided into two stages : pre - <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage ( day 1 - 5 ) and <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage ( day 6 - 11 ) .
In pre - <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage the plasma level of <START:Chemical> fatty acids <END> , <START:Chemical> triacylglycerol <END> and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid , <START:Chemical> cholesteryl esters <END> and HDL remained constant .
Plasma apolipoprotein A - I tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) .
At the beginning of <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein A - I increased abruptly ( 4 - fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steeply , in the following days .
The plasma concentration of HDL followed the same pattern .
Plasma VLDL and LDL increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) .
Plasma apolipoprotein A - I was found not only in HDL ( 1 . 063 - 1 . 210 g / ml ) but also in the LDL density class ( 1 . 025 - 1 . 050 g / ml ) .
In the pre - <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage lipoproteinuria was negligible , while in the early <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL .
These observations indicate that <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL .
It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism .

<START:Disease> Thromboembolic <END> and other complications of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> factors : summary report of a ten - year study .
During a ten - year period , 348 women were studied for a total of 5 , 877 patient months in four separate studies relating <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> to changes in hematologic parameters .
Significant increases in certain factors of the <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> and fibrinolysin systems ( factors I , II , VII , VIII , IX , and X and plasminogen ) were observed in the treated groups .
Severe complications developed in four patients .
All four had an abnormal <START:Disease> blood coagulation <END> profile , suggesting " <START:Disease> hypercoagulability <END> " before initiation of therapy .
Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients ; some increased further during therapy .
One of these patients developed a <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> before receiving any medication , shortly after the base - line values were obtained .
One patient developed <START:Disease> retinopathy <END> 19 months after she began therapy , and another developed <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> after 27 months of therapy .
The fourth patient developed <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy .
All four patients were of the A or AB blood group .
Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for <START:Disease> thromboembolic episodes <END> in patients possessing the A antigen .
It appears from these data that hematologic work - ups may be useful in women who are about to start long - term <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Prolongation of the QT interval <END> related to <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> - <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> interaction .
<START:Chemical> Cisapride <END> , a cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 ( CYP 3 A 4 ) substrate , is widely prescribed for the treatment of <START:Disease> gastrointestinal motility disorders <END> .
<START:Disease> Prolongation of QT interval <END> , <START:Disease> torsades de pointes <END> , and <START:Disease> sudden cardiac death <END> have been reported after concomitant administration with <START:Chemical> erythromycin <END> or <START:Chemical> azole <END> antifungal agents , but not with other CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors .
A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45 - year - old woman who was taking <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> for <START:Disease> gastroesophageal reflux disorder <END> and <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> , an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP 3 A 4 , for <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
The patient was in near <START:Disease> syncope <END> and had <START:Disease> QT - interval prolongation <END> .
After discontinuing <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> , the QT interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur .
We suggest that caution be taken when <START:Chemical> cisapride <END> is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4 , including <START:Chemical> diltiazem <END> .
A prospective study on the dose dependency of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> .
Since 1975 <START:Chemical> mitomycin C <END> ( <START:Chemical> MMC <END> ) has been suggested to be <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> , especially when combined with or given following <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known .
We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects .
Forty - four <START:Chemical> MMC <END> - treated patients were studied , 37 of them could be evaluated .
All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations , chest X - rays , electro - and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) determinations .
The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level .
One of the patients developed <START:Disease> cardiac failure <END> after 30 mg m - 2 <START:Chemical> MMC <END> and only 150 mg m - 2 <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiac failure <END> was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test .
None of the other patients developed clinical <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> , nor did the studied parameters change .
The literature on this subject was also reviewed .
Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature , we suggest that <START:Chemical> MMC <END> - related <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> is dose dependent , occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m - 2 or more , mainly in patients also ( previously or simultaneously ) treated with <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
The incidence is likely to be less than 10 % even for this risk group .
Thyroid function and urine - concentrating ability during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> and <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
We measured serum <START:Chemical> thyroxine <END> and urine - concentrating ability ( Umax ) in response to desmopressin ( DDAVP ) in 85 patients receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypothyroidism <END> developed in eight patients while they were taking <START:Chemical> lithium <END> .
Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> patients while some <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> patients concentrated their urine well .
It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which <START:Chemical> lithium <END> exerts these two effects are different .
<START:Chemical> Phlorizin <END> - induced <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> does not prevent <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> in rats .
Because rats with <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> ( <START:Disease> DM <END> ) have a high solute diuresis ( <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> of 10 to 12 g / day ) , we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> ( <START:Disease> ARF <END> ) .
The protection from <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> was studied in non - <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular <START:Chemical> glucose <END> reabsorption with <START:Chemical> phlorizin <END> ( <START:Chemical> P <END> ) .
<START:Disease> DM <END> rats with mild <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> ( similar in degree to that of the <START:Chemical> P <END> treated animals ) were also studied .
Unanesthetized adult female , Sprague - Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days .
Group 1 ( <START:Chemical> P <END> alone ) received <START:Chemical> P <END> , 360 mg / day , for 15 days ; Group II ( <START:Chemical> P <END> + <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ) ; Group III ( <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> alone ) and Group IV ( mild <START:Disease> DM <END> + <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ) .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxic <END> doses ( 40 mg / kg body wt / day ) of <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV .
In Group I , <START:Chemical> P <END> induced a moderate and stable <START:Disease> glycosuria <END> ( 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 g / day , SE ) , and no functional or morphologic evidence of <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> ( baseline CCr 2 . 1 + / - 0 . 1 ml / min , undetectable lysozymuria ) or damage ( <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> score [ maximum 4 ] , zero ) .
In Group II , <START:Chemical> P <END> did not prevent <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> - <START:Disease> ARF <END> ( maximal decrease in CCr at day 9 . 89 % , <START:Chemical> P <END> less than 0 . 001 ; peak lysozymuria , 1863 + / - 321 micrograms / day ; and <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> score , 3 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 ) .
These values were not different from those of Group III : maximal decrease in CCr 73 % ( <START:Chemical> P <END> less than 0 . 001 ) ; lysozymuria , 2147 + / - 701 micrograms / day ; <START:Disease> tubular necrosis <END> score , 3 . 8 + / - 0 . 1 . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Disease> Bilateral optic neuropathy <END> due to combined <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> treatment .
The case of a 40 - year - old patient who underwent an unsuccessful cadaver kidney transplantation and was treated with <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> is reported .
A <START:Disease> bilateral retrobulbar neuropathy <END> with an unusual central bitemporal hemianopic <START:Disease> scotoma <END> was found .
<START:Chemical> Ethambutol <END> was stopped and only small improvement of the visual acuity followed .
<START:Chemical> Isoniazid <END> was discontinued later , followed by a dramatic improvement in the visual acuity .
The hazards of optic nerve <START:Disease> toxicity <END> due to <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> are known .
We emphasize the potential danger in the use of <START:Chemical> ethambutol <END> and <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> induced acute <START:Disease> choreoathetosis <END> : case report and review of the literature .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> is an <START:Chemical> oxazolidine <END> derivative that is structurally different from <START:Chemical> amphetamines <END> and used in the treatment of <START:Disease> attention deficit disorder <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
The following case describes two children acutely poisoned with <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> who experienced profound <START:Disease> choreoathetosis <END> .
CASE REPORT : Two , 3 - year - old male , identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> originally containing 59 tablets .
The children had a medical history significant for <START:Disease> attention deficit disorder <END> previously treated with <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> without success .
This was their first day of <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> therapy .
The <START:Disease> choreoathetoid <END> movements began 45 min to 1 h after ingestion .
The children gave no history of prior <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> and there was no family history of <START:Disease> movement disorders <END> .
The children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> in an attempt to control the <START:Disease> choreoathetoid <END> movements .
Despite treatment , the children continued to have <START:Disease> choreoathetosis <END> for approximately 24 hours .
Forty - eight hours after admission , the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Pemoline <END> associated <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology literature .
The possibility of <START:Disease> choreoathetoid <END> movements should be considered in patients presenting after <START:Chemical> pemoline <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> .
Persistent <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> following <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
We report the case of a patient who developed severe hypernatraemic <START:Disease> dehydration <END> following a <START:Disease> head injury <END> .
Ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> , and <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy had been discontinued .
He remained thirsty and <START:Disease> polyuric <END> despite cessation of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmoregulated thirst and <START:Chemical> vasopressin <END> secretion , with clear evidence of <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> induced <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but <START:Disease> polyuria <END> persisted in this patient for ten years after <START:Chemical> lithium <END> was stopped .
We discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrogenic diabetes insipidus <END> .
Light chain <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> and cellular mediated immunity in <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> treated patients with <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> .
Light chain <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> was found in 9 of 17 <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> patients treated with <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> .
Concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were different .
Response to Varidase skin test antigen was negative for all eight <START:Disease> tuberculosis <END> patients tested , but there occurred a hyper - responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phytomitogen ( PHA - P ) .
as well as of those of seven other <START:Disease> tuberculous <END> patients .
This last finding may be related to time of testing and / or endogenous serum binding of <START:Chemical> rifampin <END> which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte .
Increased expression and apical targeting of renal ENaC subunits in <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> in rats .
<START:Disease> Nephrotic syndrome <END> is often accompanied by <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention and generalized <START:Disease> edema <END> .
However , the molecular basis for the decreased renal <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion remains undefined .
We hypothesized that epithelial <START:Chemical> Na <END> channel ( ENaC ) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention .
An experimental group of rats was treated with <START:Chemical> puromycin aminonucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ; 180 mg / kg iv ) , whereas the control group received only vehicle .
After 7 days , <START:Chemical> PAN <END> treatment induced significant <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> hypoalbuminemia <END> , decreased urinary <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion , and extensive <START:Disease> ascites <END> .
The protein abundance of alpha - ENaC and beta - ENaC was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( ISOM ) and in the inner medulla ( IM ) but was not altered in the cortex .
gamma - ENaC abundance was increased in the cortex , ISOM , and IM .
Immunoperoxidase brightfield - and laser - scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha - ENaC , beta - ENaC , and gamma - ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( DCT 2 ) , connecting tubule , and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments .
Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha - ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of <START:Chemical> PAN <END> - treated rats , indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha - ENaC subunits .
In contrast , the protein abundances of <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) / <START:Chemical> H <END> ( + ) exchanger type 3 ( NHE 3 ) , <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) - <START:Chemical> K <END> ( + ) - 2 <START:Chemical> Cl <END> ( - ) cotransporter ( BSC - 1 ) , and <START:Chemical> thiazide <END> - sensitive <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) - <START:Chemical> Cl <END> ( - ) cotransporter ( TSC ) were decreased .
Moreover , the abundance of the alpha ( 1 ) - subunit of the <START:Chemical> Na <END> - <START:Chemical> K <END> - ATPase was decreased in the cortex and ISOM , but it remained unchanged in the IM .
In conclusion , the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT 2 , connecting tubule , and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the <START:Chemical> sodium <END> retention associated with <START:Chemical> PAN <END> - induced <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
The decreased abundance of NHE 3 , BSC - 1 , TSC , and <START:Chemical> Na <END> - <START:Chemical> K <END> - ATPase may play a compensatory role to promote <START:Chemical> sodium <END> excretion .
Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody - ( PR 3 - ANCA ) positive necrotizing <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> after restarting <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> treatment .
A 59 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> ulcerative colitis <END> developed <START:Disease> red eyes <END> , <START:Disease> pleural effusion <END> , <START:Disease> eosinophilia <END> and <START:Disease> urinary abnormalities <END> after restarting of <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> treatment .
Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed <START:Disease> segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis <END> without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement .
Proteinase 3 - antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( PR 3 - ANCA ) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units ( EU ) in sera ( normal range less than 10 EU ) , myeloperoxidase - ANCA was negative .
PR 3 - ANCA titer was 250 and 1 , 070 EU in <START:Disease> pleural effusions <END> on right and left side , respectively .
Although cessation of <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> treatment resulted in improvements in <START:Disease> fever <END> , <START:Disease> red eyes <END> , <START:Disease> chest pain <END> , titer of C - reactive protein and volume of the <START:Disease> pleural effusions <END> , we initiated <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy , because PR 3 - ANCA titer rose to 320 EU , eosinophil count increased to 1 , 100 cells / microl , and the <START:Disease> pleural effusion <END> remained .
One month after <START:Chemical> steroid <END> therapy , the <START:Disease> pleural effusion <END> disappeared , and PR 3 - ANCA titer normalized 3 months later .
This case suggests that <START:Chemical> sulphasalazine <END> can induce PR 3 - ANCA - positive necrotizing <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> .
Nerve growth factor and <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> in the urine of female patients with <START:Disease> overactive bladder <END> .
PURPOSE : NGF and <START:Chemical> PGs <END> in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine .
We investigated changes in urinary NGF and <START:Chemical> PGs <END> in women with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The study groups included 65 women with <START:Disease> OAB <END> and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls .
Evaluation included patient history , urinalysis , a voiding diary and urodynamic studies .
Urine samples were collected .
NGF , <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> , <START:Chemical> PGF 2 alpha <END> and <START:Chemical> PGI 2 <END> were measured using enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups .
In addition , correlations between urinary NGF and <START:Chemical> PG <END> , and urodynamic parameters in patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> were examined .
RESULTS : Urinary NGF , <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> and <START:Chemical> PGF 2 alpha <END> were significantly increased in patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> compared with controls ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
However , urinary <START:Chemical> PGI 2 <END> was not different between controls and patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
In patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> urinary <START:Chemical> PGE 2 <END> positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Urinary NGF , <START:Chemical> PGF 2 alpha <END> and <START:Chemical> PGI 2 <END> did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with <START:Disease> OAB <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : NGF and <START:Chemical> PGs <END> have important roles in the development of <START:Disease> OAB <END> symptoms in female patients .
Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate <START:Disease> OAB <END> symptoms .
Fatal <START:Disease> haemorrhagic myocarditis <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Haemorrhagic myocarditis <END> is a rare but important complication of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> therapy .
Echocardiographic identification of the disorder can be made .
We believe that the ultrasound features of this disorder have not been previously reported .
Peripheral <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> induced <START:Disease> degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <END> in rat substantia nigra .
<START:Chemical> Iron <END> accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
To demonstrate the relationship between peripheral <START:Chemical> iron <END> overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( SN ) , in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry , <START:Chemical> tyrosine <END> hydroxylase ( TH ) immunohistochemistry , Perls ' <START:Chemical> iron <END> staining , and high performance liquid chromatography - electrochemical detection to study the <START:Disease> degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <END> and increased <START:Chemical> iron <END> content in the SN of <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> overloaded animals .
The findings showed that peripheral <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> overload increased the <START:Chemical> iron <END> staining positive cells and reduced the number of TH - immunoreactive neurons in the SN .
As a result , <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> release and content , as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate putamen .
Even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload group .
These results suggest that peripheral <START:Chemical> iron dextran <END> can increase the <START:Chemical> iron <END> level in the SN , where excessive <START:Chemical> iron <END> causes the <START:Disease> degeneration of dopaminergic neurons <END> .
The chronic <START:Chemical> iron <END> overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute <START:Chemical> iron <END> overload .
<START:Chemical> Methylphenidate <END> - induced <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive symptoms <END> in an elderly man .
An 82 - year - old man with <START:Disease> treatment - resistant depression <END> and early <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> was started on <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> .
Significant <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive behavior <END> ensued but diminished over several weeks when <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> was replaced by <START:Chemical> fluvoxamine <END> .
The patient had no prior <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> history , but he had a sister with <START:Disease> obsessive - compulsive disorder <END> .
It appears that <START:Chemical> methylphenidate <END> precipitated the patient ' s pathological behavior .
Mice lacking mPGES - 1 are resistant to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
Cyclooxygenase - 2 activity is required for the development of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> .
However , the involvement of a specific , terminal <START:Chemical> prostaglandin <END> ( <START:Chemical> PG <END> ) isomerase has not been evaluated .
The present study was undertaken to assess <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> in mice deficient in microsomal <START:Chemical> prostaglandin E <END> synthase - 1 ( mPGES - 1 ) .
A 2 - wk administration of <START:Chemical> LiCl <END> ( 4 mmol . kg ( - 1 ) . day ( - 1 ) ip ) in mPGES - 1 + / + mice led to a marked <START:Disease> polyuria <END> with hyposmotic urine .
This was associated with elevated renal mPGES - 1 protein expression and increased urine <START:Chemical> PGE ( 2 ) <END> excretion .
In contrast , mPGES - 1 - / - mice were largely resistant to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> and a urine concentrating defect , accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine <START:Chemical> PGE ( 2 ) <END> and cAMP output .
Immunoblotting , immunohistochemistry , and quantitative ( q ) RT - PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin - 2 ( AQP 2 ) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - treated + / + mice .
This decrease was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
qRT - PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP 2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex .
Similarly , the total protein abundance of the <START:Chemical> Na <END> - <START:Chemical> K <END> - 2 <START:Chemical> Cl <END> cotransporter ( NKCC 2 ) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the + / + mice was significantly reduced by <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment .
In contrast , the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC 2 expression was significantly attenuated in the - / - mice .
We conclude that mPGES - 1 - derived <START:Chemical> PGE ( 2 ) <END> mediates <START:Chemical> lithium <END> - induced <START:Disease> polyuria <END> likely via inhibition of AQP 2 and NKCC 2 expression .
<START:Disease> Graft - versus - host disease <END> prophylaxis with <START:Chemical> everolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> is associated with a high incidence of <START:Disease> sinusoidal obstruction syndrome <END> and <START:Disease> microangiopathy <END> : results of the EVTAC trial .
A calcineurin inhibitor combined with <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> is the standard prophylaxis for <START:Disease> graft - versus - host disease <END> ( <START:Disease> GVHD <END> ) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) .
<START:Chemical> Everolimus <END> , a derivative of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> , seems to mediate antileukemia effects .
We report on a combination of <START:Chemical> everolimus <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> in 24 patients ( median age , 62 years ) with either <START:Disease> myelodysplastic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> MDS <END> ; n = 17 ) or <START:Disease> acute myeloid leukemia <END> ( <START:Disease> AML <END> ; n = 7 ) undergoing intensive conditioning followed by HSCT from related ( n = 4 ) or unrelated ( n = 20 ) donors .
All patients engrafted , and only 1 patient experienced grade IV <START:Disease> mucositis <END> .
Nine patients ( 37 % ) developed acute grade II - IV <START:Disease> GVHD <END> , and 11 of 17 evaluable patients ( 64 % ) developed chronic extensive <START:Disease> GVHD <END> .
<START:Disease> Transplantation - associated microangiopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> TMA <END> ) occurred in 7 patients ( 29 % ) , with 2 cases of <START:Disease> acute renal failure <END> .
The study was terminated prematurely because an additional 6 patients ( 25 % ) developed <START:Disease> sinusoidal obstruction syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> SOS <END> ) , which was fatal in 2 cases .
With a median follow - up of 26 months , the 2 - year overall survival rate was 47 % .
Although this new combination appears to be effective as a prophylactic regimen for acute <START:Disease> GVHD <END> , the incidence of <START:Disease> TMA <END> and <START:Disease> SOS <END> is considerably higher than seen with other regimens .
<START:Chemical> Pravastatin <END> - associated <START:Disease> myopathy <END> .
Report of a case .
A case of acute <START:Disease> inflammatory myopathy <END> associated with the use of <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> , a new hydrophilic 3 - hydroxy - 3 methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase inhibitor , is reported .
The patient , a 69 - year - old man was affected by <START:Disease> non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus <END> and <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
He assumed <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> ( 20 mg / day ) because of <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
He was admitted with acute <START:Disease> myopathy <END> of the lower limbs which resolved in a few days after <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> discontinuation .
A previously unknown <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> , probably due to chronic <START:Disease> autoimmune thyroiditis <END> , was evidenced .
Muscle biopsy ( left gastrocnemius ) revealed a perimysial and endomysial inflammatory infiltrate with a prevalence of CD 4 + lymphocytes .
While <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> and <START:Chemical> simvastatin <END> have been associated with toxic <START:Disease> myopathy <END> , <START:Chemical> pravastatin <END> - associated <START:Disease> myopathy <END> could represent a distinct , inflammatory entity .
Behavioral effects of pubertal anabolic androgenic <START:Chemical> steroid <END> exposure in male rats with low <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> .
The goal of this study was to assess the interactive effects of chronic anabolic androgenic <START:Chemical> steroid <END> ( AAS ) exposure and brain <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptamine <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ) depletion on behavior of pubertal male rats .
<START:Chemical> Serotonin <END> was depleted beginning on postnatal day 26 with <START:Chemical> parachlorophenylalanine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> 100 mg / kg , every other day ) ; controls received saline .
At puberty ( P 40 ) , half the <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> - treated rats and half the saline - treated rats began treatment with <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> T <END> , 5 mg / kg , 5 days / week ) .
Behavioral measures included locomotion , <START:Disease> irritability <END> , copulation , partner preference , and <START:Disease> aggression <END> .
Animals were tested for <START:Disease> aggression <END> in their home cage , both with and without physical provocation ( mild tail pinch ) .
Brain levels of <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> and its metabolite , <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HIAA <END> ) , were determined using HPLC .
<START:Chemical> PCPA <END> significantly and substantially depleted <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> and <START:Chemical> 5 - HIAA <END> in all brain regions examined .
Chronic <START:Chemical> T <END> treatment significantly decreased <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> and <START:Chemical> 5 - HIAA <END> in certain brain areas , but to a much lesser extent than <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> .
Chronic exposure to <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased <START:Disease> irritability <END> but had no effect on sexual behavior , partner preference , or <START:Disease> aggression <END> .
<START:Chemical> T <END> alone had no effect on locomotion , <START:Disease> irritability <END> , or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and <START:Disease> aggression <END> .
The most striking effect of combining <START:Chemical> T <END> + <START:Chemical> PCPA <END> was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack , particularly following physical provocation .
Based on these data , it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> may be especially prone to exhibit <START:Disease> aggressive behavior <END> .
Predictors of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in patients with <START:Disease> heart failure <END> during <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy : results from the studies of <START:Disease> left ventricular dysfunction <END> ( SOLVD )
BACKGROUND : Although <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:Disease> CHF <END> ) , it may also cause <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> .
Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication .
OBJECTIVE : To quantify specific clinical predictors of <START:Disease> reduction in renal function <END> in patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> who are prescribed <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> - converting enzyme inhibitor therapy .
METHOD : We analyzed data from the Studies of <START:Disease> Left Ventricular Dysfunction <END> ( SOLVD ) , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> for the treatment of <START:Disease> CHF <END> .
There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> with a median follow - up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow - up of 967 days .
<START:Disease> Decreased renal function <END> was defined as a rise in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> > / = 0 . 5 mg / dL ( 44 micromol / L ) from baseline .
We used time - to - event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age , baseline ejection fraction , baseline <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , low systolic blood pressure ( < 100 mm Hg ) , history of <START:Disease> hypertension <END> , <START:Disease> diabetes <END> , and use of antiplatelet , <START:Chemical> diuretic <END> , and beta - blocker therapy .
RESULTS : Patients randomly assigned to <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> had a 33 % greater likelihood of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> than controls ( P = . 003 ) .
By multivariate analysis , in both the placebo and <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> groups older age , <START:Chemical> diuretic <END> therapy , and <START:Disease> diabetes <END> were associated with <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> , whereas beta - blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective .
Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in both groups , but significantly more so in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> group ( <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> : risk ratio [ RR ] 1 . 42 per 10 years , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 - 1 . 52 with <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> ; placebo : RR 1 . 18 , 95 % CI 1 . 12 - 1 . 25 ) .
<START:Chemical> Diuretic <END> therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> group ( RR 1 . 89 , 95 % CI 1 . 70 - 2 . 08 ) than in the placebo group ( RR 1 . 35 , 95 % CI 1 . 09 - 1 . 66 ) .
Conversely , <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> had a relative renoprotective effect ( RR 1 . 33 , 95 % CI 1 . 13 - 1 . 53 ) compared with placebo ( RR 1 . 96 , 95 % CI 1 . 57 - 2 . 44 ) in patients with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> .
A lower risk of <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> was seen in both groups with beta - blocker therapy ( RR 0 . 70 , 95 % CI 0 . 57 - 0 . 85 ) and higher baseline ejection fraction ( RR 0 . 93 per 5 % increment , 95 % CI 0 . 91 - 0 .
96 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Enalapril <END> use caused a 33 % increase in the risk of <START:Disease> decreased renal function <END> in patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> .
<START:Chemical> Diuretic <END> use and advanced age increased this risk .
<START:Disease> Diabetes <END> was associated with an increased risk of <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> in all patients with <START:Disease> CHF <END> , but this risk was reduced in the <START:Chemical> enalapril <END> group compared with the placebo group .
beta - Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy .
Effects of <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> on cholinesterase and <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
The effects of <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> on cholinesterase , <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well - known cholinesterase inhibitors <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> and <START:Chemical> E - 2020 <END> .
<START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> , <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> and <START:Chemical> E - 2020 <END> all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) in human red blood cells ( IC 50 s = 1 . 0 x 10 ( - 6 ) , 2 . 9 x 10 ( - 7 ) and 3 . 7 x 10 ( - 8 ) M , respectively ) .
In addition , <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> and <START:Chemical> tacrine <END> , but not <START:Chemical> E - 2020 <END> , strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase ( BuChE ) in human serum .
All three drugs produced mixed inhibition of AChE activity .
Moreover , the inhibitory effect of <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> on AChE was reversible .
All compounds at 0 . 1 - 1 mg / kg p . o . significantly improved the <START:Disease> amnesia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 0 . 5 mg / kg s . c . ) in rats performing a passive avoidance task .
The three compounds at 1 and 3 mg / kg p . o . did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rats .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> at a low dose ( 0 . 1 - 1 mg / kg p . o . ) improves <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> but does not affect spontaneous movement .
The findings suggest that <START:Chemical> NIK - 247 <END> may be a useful drug for the treatment of <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> in humans .
BACKGROUND : Preclinical studies of intrathecal <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> suggest it may be effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> acute and chronic pain <END> in humans , and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> suggests it may be effective in <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> states but not with acute noxious stimulation .
The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> marketed in the US , using both acute noxious stimulation and <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> - evoked mechanical <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> .
METHODS : Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent , 65 volunteers were studied in two trials : an open - label , dose - escalating trial with intrathecal <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> doses of 0 . 25 - 2 . 0 mg and a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> , 2 mg . Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis , and <START:Disease> pain <END> ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of <START:Disease> mechanical hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> allodynia <END> after intradermal <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> injection were determined .
RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Adenosine <END> produced no effect on <START:Disease> pain <END> report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced <START:Disease> mechanical hyperalgesia <END> and <START:Disease> allodynia <END> from intradermal <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> injection for at least 24 h .
In contrast , residence time of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( < 4 h ) .
CONCLUSIONS : These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> of <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> , presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> injection .
The long - lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic <START:Disease> neuropathic pain <END> and is not due to prolonged residence of <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> in cerebrospinal fluid .
Minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunction <END> , cognitive development , and somatic development at the age of 3 to 7 years after <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment in very - low birth - weight infants .
The objective of this study was to assess minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunction <END> , cognitive development , and somatic development after <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> therapy in very - low - birthweight infants .
Thirty - three children after <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment were matched to 33 children without <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment .
Data were assessed at the age of 3 - 7 years .
<START:Chemical> Dexamethasone <END> was started between the 7 th and the 28 th day of life over 7 days with a total dose of 2 . 35 mg / kg / day .
Exclusion criteria were <START:Disease> asphyxia <END> , <START:Disease> malformations <END> , major surgical interventions , small for gestational age , intraventricular <START:Disease> haemorrhage <END> grades III and IV , <START:Disease> periventricular leukomalacia <END> , and severe <START:Disease> psychomotor retardation <END> .
Each child was examined by a neuropediatrician for minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunctions <END> and tested by a psychologist for cognitive development with a Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and a Draw - a - Man Test .
There were no differences in demographic data , growth , and socio - economic status between the two groups .
Fine motor skills and gross motor function were significantly better in the control group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
In the Draw - a - Man Test , the control group showed better results ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
There were no differences in development of speech , social development , and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children .
After <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> treatment , children showed a higher rate of minor <START:Disease> neurological dysfunctions <END> .
Neurological development was affected even without neurological diagnosis .
Further long - term follow - up studies will be necessary to fully evaluate the impact of <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> on neurological and cognitive development .
Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> discharges in <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> model in rats .
AIM : Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity , but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined .
The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity in <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> model .
MATERIAL AND METHODS : Twenty - five Sprague - Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes .
In group - 1 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group - 2 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal DBS was on ( 185 Hz , 0 . 5 V , 1 V , 2 V , and 5 V for 60 sec ) following <START:Chemical> penicillin G <END> injection intracortically .
In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8 l saline injection intracortically .
EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following <START:Chemical> penicillin - G <END> injection , and at 10 th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency , amplitude , and power spectrum .
RESULTS : High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute <START:Chemical> penicillin <END> - induced cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity independent from stimulus intensity .
In the control group , hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5 V stimulation .
CONCLUSION : Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical <START:Disease> epileptic <END> activity effectively without causing secondary <START:Disease> epileptic <END> discharges .
These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with <START:Disease> epilepsy <END> .
Late <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> after treatment for a malignant <START:Disease> bone tumor <END> .
Cardiac function was assessed in long - term survivors of malignant <START:Disease> bone tumors <END> who were treated according to <START:Chemical> Rosen ' s T 5 or T 10 protocol <END> , both including <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
Thirty - one patients , age 10 - 45 years ( median age 17 . 8 years ) were evaluated 2 . 3 - 14 . 1 years ( median 8 . 9 years ) following completion of treatment .
Cumulative doses of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> were 225 - 550 mg / m 2 ( median dose 360 ) .
The evaluation consisted of a history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , signal averaged ECG , 24 - hour ambulatory ECG , echocardiography and radionuclide angiography .
Eighteen of 31 ( 58 % ) patients showed <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> , defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities : late potentials , complex <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> , left <START:Disease> ventricular dilation <END> , decreased shortening fraction , or decreased ejection fraction .
The incidence of <START:Disease> cardiac abnormalities <END> increased with length of follow - up ( P < or = . 05 ) .
No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and cardiac status , except for heart rate variability .
When adjusted to body surface area , the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( LVPW index ) was decreased in all patients .
The incidence of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> is high and increases with follow - up , irrespective of cumulative dose .
Life - long cardiac follow - up in these patients is warranted .
The results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and LVPW index could be sensitive indicators for <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Delayed <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> with <START:Disease> stroke <END> - like presentation in chemotherapy recipients .
BACKGROUND : A transient <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> mimicking <START:Disease> cerebrovascular accident <END> has been described as a complication of chemotherapy , most commonly in recipients of intrathecal <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> for childhood <START:Disease> leukaemia <END> .
Recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administration .
METHODS : We reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with <START:Disease> stroke <END> - like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy .
We only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging data .
Patients with <START:Disease> cerebrovascular accidents <END> were excluded .
RESULTS : We identified 27 reports of toxic <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> in patients treated with <START:Chemical> methotrexate <END> ( intrathecal , systemic ) , <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> and its derivative <START:Chemical> carmofur <END> , and <START:Chemical> capecitabine <END> .
Diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) of all patients revealed well demarcated hyperintense <START:Disease> lesions within the subcortical white matter <END> of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum , corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients ) .
Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories .
Complete resolution of symptoms within 1 - 4 days was accompanied by normalisation of ADC abnormalities .
However , fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) sequences frequently revealed persistent <START:Disease> white matter abnormalities <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Several pathophysiological models of delayed <START:Disease> leukoencephalopathy <END> after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been proposed .
DWI findings in this cohort are indicative of <START:Disease> cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter <END> and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome .
Probing peripheral and central cholinergic system responses .
OBJECTIVE : The pharmacological response to drugs that act on the cholinergic system of the iris has been used to predict deficits in central cholinergic functioning due to diseases such as <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> , yet correlations between central and peripheral responses have not been properly studied .
This study assessed the effect of normal aging on ( 1 ) the <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> - induced increase in pupil diameter , and ( 2 ) the reversal of this effect with <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Scopolamine <END> was used as a positive control to detect age - dependent changes in central cholinergic functioning in the elderly .
DESIGN : Randomized double - blind controlled trial .
PARTICIPANTS : Ten healthy elderly ( mean age 70 ) and 9 young ( mean age 33 ) volunteers .
INTERVENTIONS : Pupil diameter was monitored using a computerized infrared pupillometer over 4 hours .
The study involved 4 sessions .
In 1 session , <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other .
In another session , <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> ( 20 microL , 0 . 01 % ) was administered to both eyes , followed 23 minutes later by the application of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ( 20 microL , 0 . 1 % ) to one eye and placebo to the other .
All eye drops were given in a randomized order .
In 2 separate sessions , a single dose of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> ( 0 . 5 mg , intravenously ) or placebo was administered , and the effects on word recall were measured using the Buschke Selective Reminding Test over 2 hours .
OUTCOME MEASURES : Pupil size at time points after administration of <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> and <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ; <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> impairment in word recall <END> .
RESULTS : There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> at any time point ( p > 0 . 05 ) .
The elderly group had a significantly greater <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced net decrease in pupil size 85 , 125 , 165 and 215 minutes after administration , compared with the young group ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
Compared with the young group , the elderly group had greater <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> impairment in word recall <END> 60 , 90 and 120 minutes after administration ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
CONCLUSION : There is an age - related pupillary response to <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> that is not found with <START:Chemical> tropicamide <END> .
Thus , <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> may be useful to assess variations in central cholinergic function in elderly patients .
Long - term efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of high - dose <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> therapy for <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> was administered to 154 patients who had sustained , symptomatic <START:Disease> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( <START:Disease> VT <END> ) ( n = 118 ) or a <START:Disease> cardiac arrest <END> ( n = 36 ) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs .
The loading dose was 800 mg / day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg / day .
Sixty - nine percent of patients continued treatment with <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> and had no recurrence of symptomatic <START:Disease> VT <END> or <START:Disease> ventricular fibrillation <END> ( <START:Disease> VF <END> ) over a follow - up of 6 to 52 months ( mean + / - standard deviation 14 . 2 + / - 8 . 2 ) .
Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of <START:Disease> VT <END> and were successfully managed by continuing <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug .
One or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51 % of patients .
Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> in 41 % and discontinuation of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> in 10 % of patients .
The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were <START:Disease> tremor <END> or <START:Disease> ataxia <END> ( 35 % ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> and <START:Disease> anorexia <END> ( 8 % ) , <START:Disease> visual halos or blurring <END> ( 6 % ) , <START:Disease> thyroid function abnormalities <END> ( 6 % ) and <START:Disease> pulmonary interstitial infiltrates <END> ( 5 % ) .
Although large - dose <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> is highly effective in the long - term treatment of <START:Disease> VT <END> or <START:Disease> VF <END> refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs , it causes significant <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in approximately 50 % of patients .
However , when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects , 75 % of patients with <START:Disease> VT <END> or <START:Disease> VF <END> can be successfully managed with <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> .
<START:Chemical> Calcium carbonate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> : the updated <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> ; report of 3 cases and review of the literature .
OBJECTIVE : To describe 3 patients with <START:Chemical> calcium carbonate <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and gain insights into the cause and management of the <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> .
METHODS : We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> ( corrected serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> > or = 14 mg / dL ) and review the pertinent literature on <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> .
RESULTS : The 3 patients had <START:Disease> acute renal insufficiency <END> , relative <START:Disease> metabolic alkalosis <END> , and low parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , PTH - related peptide , and <START:Chemical> 1 , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D <END> concentrations .
No malignant lesion was found .
Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> .
The 2 patients with the higher serum <START:Chemical> calcium <END> concentrations received <START:Chemical> pamidronate <END> intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg , respectively ) , which caused severe <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> .
Of the 3 patients , 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental <START:Chemical> calcium <END> ( 1 g and 2 g daily , respectively ) in the form of <START:Chemical> calcium carbonate <END> .
In addition to our highlighted cases , we review the history , classification , pathophysiologic features , and treatment of <START:Disease> milk - alkali syndrome <END> and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003 .
CONCLUSION : <START:Disease> Milk - alkali syndrome <END> may be a common cause of unexplained <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested <START:Chemical> calcium carbonate <END> in susceptible persons .
Treatment with hydration , <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> , and discontinuation of the <START:Chemical> calcium <END> and <START:Chemical> vitamin D <END> source is adequate .
<START:Chemical> Pamidronate <END> treatment is associated with considerable risk for <START:Disease> hypocalcemia <END> , even in cases of initially severe <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> .
Systemic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> following administration of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> ( formerly <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ) for <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> : association of <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> with apoptosis of lesional lymphocytes .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Sirolimus <END> ( formerly <START:Chemical> rapamycin <END> ) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T - cell activation .
After 2 individuals with <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> developed a <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> following treatment with oral <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apoptosis .
OBSERVATIONS : A keratome skin specimen from 1 patient with <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> - induced <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> had a 2 . 3 - fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48 % ) compared with an unaffected <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> - treated patient with <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> ( 21 % ) .
Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> - induced apoptosis than did normal T cells , particularly in the presence of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : Severe adverse effects of <START:Chemical> sirolimus <END> include <START:Disease> fever <END> , <START:Disease> anemia <END> , and <START:Disease> capillary leak syndrome <END> .
These symptoms may be the result of drug - induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes , especially activated T lymphocytes , and possibly release of inflammatory mediators .
Because patients with severe <START:Disease> psoriasis <END> may develop <START:Disease> capillary leak <END> from various systemic therapies , clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with <START:Disease> inflammatory diseases <END> who are treated with immune modulators .
<START:Disease> Venous complications <END> of <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> versus <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> .
Although some studies have suggested fewer <START:Disease> venous complications <END> are associated with <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> than with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> for endoscopic procedures , this variable has not been well documented .
We prospectively evaluated the incidence of <START:Disease> venous complications <END> after intravenous injection of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> or <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy .
Overall , <START:Disease> venous complications <END> were more frequent with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 22 of 62 patients ) than with <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> ( 4 of 60 patients ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
A palpable venous cord was present in 23 % ( 14 of 62 ) of patients in the <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> group , compared with 2 % ( 1 of 60 patients ) in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group ( p < 0 . 002 ) .
<START:Disease> Pain <END> at the injection site occurred in 35 % ( 22 of 62 ) of patients in the <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> group compared with 7 % ( 4 of 60 patients ) in the <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
<START:Disease> Swelling <END> and warmth at the injection site were not significantly different between the two groups .
Smoking , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug use , intravenous catheter site , dwell time of the needle , <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> use , and <START:Disease> pain <END> during the injection had no effect on the incidence of <START:Disease> venous complications <END> .
Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) in <START:Disease> arteritis <END> induced in rats by <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> and <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> , vasodilators .
<START:Disease> Arteritis <END> induced in rats by vasodilators , <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> and <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> , was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> synthase ( iNOS ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) and <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) .
Rats were administered <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> .
Irrespective of <START:Chemical> theophylline <END> administration , iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on day 5 and 8 post - <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> - infusion ( DPI ) ; bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED - 1 - positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI ; TGF - beta 1 antigens were observed in ED - 1 - positive cells on and after 5 DPI .
These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen , and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat <START:Disease> arteritis <END> models .
On the other hand , TGF - beta 1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models .
The protective role of Nrf 2 in <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
OBJECTIVE : <START:Disease> Diabetic nephropathy <END> is one of the major causes of <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , which is accompanied by the production of reactive <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> species ( ROS ) .
Nrf 2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis .
Here , we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf 2 against <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We explore the protective role of Nrf 2 against <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> using human kidney biopsy tissues from <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> patients , a <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> model in Nrf 2 ( - / - ) mice , and cultured human mesangial cells .
RESULTS : The glomeruli of human <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf 2 levels .
In the animal study , Nrf 2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> renal damage <END> .
This is evident by Nrf 2 ( - / - ) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and <START:Disease> renal injury <END> compared with Nrf 2 ( + / + ) mice .
Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf 2 - mediated protection against <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> is , at least , partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor - beta 1 ( TGF - beta 1 ) and reduction of extracellular matrix production .
In human renal mesangial cells , high <START:Chemical> glucose <END> induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf 2 and its downstream genes .
Furthermore , activation or overexpression of Nrf 2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF - beta 1 in a dose - dependent manner , whereas knockdown of Nrf 2 by siRNA enhanced TGF - beta 1 transcription and fibronectin production .
CONCLUSIONS : This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf 2 in <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> , suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf 2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of <START:Disease> diabetic nephropathy <END> .
Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L . , <START:Chemical> crocin <END> on <START:Chemical> streptozocin <END> - induced model of sporadic <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> in male rats .
BACKGROUND : The involvement of water - soluble <START:Chemical> carotenoids <END> , <START:Chemical> crocins <END> , as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L . extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed .
In the present study , the effect of <START:Chemical> crocins <END> on sporadic <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> induced by intracerebroventricular ( icv ) <START:Chemical> streptozocin <END> ( <START:Chemical> STZ <END> ) in male rats was investigated .
METHODS : Male adult Wistar rats ( n = 90 and 260 - 290 g ) were divided into 1 , control ; 2 and 3 , <START:Chemical> crocins <END> ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) ; 4 , <START:Chemical> STZ <END> ; 5 and 6 , <START:Chemical> STZ <END> + <START:Chemical> crocins <END> ( 15 and 30 mg / kg ) groups .
In <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> groups , rats were injected with <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - icv bilaterally ( 3 mg / kg ) in first day and 3 days later , a similar <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - icv application was repeated .
In <START:Chemical> STZ <END> + <START:Chemical> crocin <END> animal groups , <START:Chemical> crocin <END> was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg / kg , i . p . , one day pre - surgery and continued for three weeks .
Prescription of <START:Chemical> crocin <END> in each dose was repeated once for two days .
However , the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm , and for spatial cognition evaluation , Y - maze task was used .
RESULTS : It was found out that <START:Chemical> crocin <END> ( 30 mg / kg ) - treated <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y - maze than vehicle - treated <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - injected rats .
In addition , <START:Chemical> crocin <END> in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated <START:Disease> learning and memory impairment <END> in treated <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - injected group in passive avoidance test .
CONCLUSION : Therefore , these results demonstrate the effectiveness of <START:Chemical> crocin <END> ( 30 mg / kg ) in antagonizing the <START:Disease> cognitive deficits <END> caused by <START:Chemical> STZ <END> - icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of <START:Disease> neurodegenerative diseases <END> such as <START:Disease> Alzheimer ' s disease <END> .
The ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes mellitus <END> .
1 . The effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats were investigated .
2 .
<START:Disease> Diabetes <END> of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition ; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment .
3 .
Insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats to nerve stimulation , <START:Chemical> ATP <END> , and <START:Chemical> bethanechol <END> .
4 . <START:Disease> Diabetes <END> of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight , and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition , effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study .
5 .
Insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from <START:Disease> diabetic <END> rats to nerve stimulation , <START:Chemical> ATP <END> , and <START:Chemical> bethanechol <END> .
6 .
The data indicate that the effects of <START:Chemical> streptozotocin <END> - induced <START:Disease> diabetes <END> on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment .
Fatal excited <START:Disease> delirium <END> following <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use : epidemiologic findings provide new evidence for mechanisms of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
We describe an outbreak of deaths from <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced excited <START:Disease> delirium <END> ( <START:Disease> EDDs <END> ) in Dade County , Florida between 1979 and 1990 .
From a registry of all <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - related deaths in Dade County , Florida , from 1969 - 1990 , 58 <START:Disease> EDDs <END> were compared with 125 victims of accidental <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> without excited <START:Disease> delirium <END> .
Compared with controls , <START:Disease> EDDs <END> were more frequently black , male , and younger .
They were less likely to have a low body mass index , and more likely to have died in police custody , to have received medical treatment immediately before death , to have survived for a longer period , to have developed <START:Disease> hyperthermia <END> , and to have died in summer months .
<START:Disease> EDDs <END> had concentrations of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> benzoylecgonine <END> in autopsy blood that were similar to those for controls .
The epidemiologic findings are most consistent with the hypothesis that chronic <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use disrupts dopaminergic function and , when coupled with recent <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> use , may precipitate <START:Disease> agitation <END> , <START:Disease> delirium <END> , aberrant thermoregulation , <START:Disease> rhabdomyolysis <END> , and <START:Disease> sudden death <END> .
<START:Disease> Cerebral sinus thrombosis <END> as a potential hazard of antifibrinolytic treatment in <START:Disease> menorrhagia <END> .
We describe a 42 - year - old woman who developed superior <START:Disease> sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis <END> associated with prolonged <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> therapy for <START:Disease> menorrhagia <END> .
This antifibrinolytic agent has been used in women with <START:Disease> menorrhagia <END> to promote clotting and reduce <START:Disease> blood loss <END> .
Although increased risk of <START:Disease> thromboembolic disease <END> has been reported during treatment with <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> , <START:Disease> cerebral sinus thrombosis <END> has not been previously described .
Careful use of <START:Chemical> epsilon - aminocaproic acid <END> therapy is recommended .
Down - regulation of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> transporter function induced by chronic administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local - anesthetics - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and the counteraction by co - administration with local anesthetics .
Alterations of <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> transporter ( NET ) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to <START:Disease> seizures <END> induce by <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and local anesthetics were studied in mice .
Daily administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> , an inhibitor of the NET , for 5 days decreased [ ( 3 ) H ] <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> uptake in the P 2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex , striatum or amygdalae .
Co - administration of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> , <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> or <START:Chemical> tricaine <END> with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> reversed this effect .
Daily treatment of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> increased [ ( 3 ) H ] <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> uptake into the hippocampus .
Daily administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> increased the incidence of appearance of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> and decreased that of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Co - administration of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> with <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> reversed the changes of <START:Disease> convulsive <END> activity of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> induced by repeated administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> .
These results suggest that down - regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> may be relevant to <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> - induced sensitization of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
Inhibition of <START:Chemical> Na <END> ( + ) channels by local anesthetics may regulate <START:Chemical> desipramine <END> - induced down - regulation of NET function .
Repeated administration of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> induces up - regulation of hippocampal NET function .
<START:Chemical> Desipramine <END> - induced sensitization of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> .
A <START:Disease> dystonia <END> - like syndrome after neuropeptide ( <START:Chemical> MSH <END> / <START:Chemical> ACTH <END> ) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus .
The <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic <START:Disease> dystonia <END> , and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit .
The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE - mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway .
However , it is not certain as to the following : ( a ) what receptors were stimulated by the <START:Chemical> ACTH <END> N - terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder ; ( b ) whether NE , released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo - cerebellar pathway , did indeed cause the long - term <START:Disease> depression <END> at Purkinje cell synapses ( previously described by others ) that resulted in the long duration of the <START:Disease> movement disorder <END> ; ( c ) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei , the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons , that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder .
These questions are currently being investigated .
Can <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> reduce <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> induced <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> ?
This study was undertaken to determine the effect of <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> pretreatment on reduction of <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myalgia <END> in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery .
One hundred and thirty - five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective , double blind , randomized manner .
Group PS , the control group , received normal saline and <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) ; Group LS , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) and <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> 1 . 5 mg x kg ( - 1 ) ; Group PR , normal saline and <START:Chemical> rocuronium <END> 0 . 6 mg x kg ( - 1 ) .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> 0 . 1 mg x kg ( - 1 ) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor , ECG and pulse oximetry .
Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg . kg ( - 1 ) <START:Chemical> thiopental <END> iv .
followed by <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> ( Group PS , LS ) or <START:Chemical> rocuronium <END> ( Group PR ) for tracheal intubation .
Following administration of these agents , the presence , and degree of <START:Disease> fasciculation <END> were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered .
The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions .
Twenty - four hours later , any <START:Disease> myalgia <END> experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management .
The results indicate that <START:Disease> muscle fasciculation <END> was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of <START:Disease> muscle fasciculation <END> than those in Group PS ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
At 24 h , the incidence of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
A correlation was not found between the incidence of <START:Disease> myalgia <END> and the occurrence of <START:Disease> muscle fasciculation <END> .
The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups .
In conclusion , where <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> is used , <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of <START:Disease> postoperative myalgia <END> .
Effect of myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy on the electrophysiologic function of the retina and optic nerve .
PURPOSE : To assess by electrophysiologic testing the effect of photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) on the retina and optic nerve .
SETTING : Eye Clinic , S . Salvatore Hospital , L ' Aquila University , Italy .
METHODS : Standard pattern electroretinograms ( P - ERGs ) and standard pattern visual evoked potentials ( P - VEPs ) were done in 25 eyes of 25 patients who had myopic PRK for an attempted correction between 5 . 00 and 15 . 00 diopters ( D ) ( mean 8 . 00 D ) .
Testing was done preoperatively and 3 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months postoperatively .
The contralateral eyes served as controls .
During the follow - up , 3 patients ( 12 % ) developed <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - induced <START:Disease> elevated intraocular pressure <END> ( IOP ) that resolved after <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> therapy was discontinued .
RESULTS : No statistically significant differences were seen between treated and control eyes nor between treated eyes preoperatively and postoperatively .
CONCLUSION : Myopic excimer laser PRK did not seem to affect the posterior segment .
The transient <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - induced <START:Disease> IOP rise <END> did not seem to cause functional impairment .
Reversal of <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> in rats by <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> : a peripheral effect .
<START:Chemical> Ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1 . 7 mmol <START:Chemical> NH 4 CL <END> .
This <START:Disease> coma <END> was prevented with 1 . 68 mmol <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the <START:Chemical> ammonium salt <END> injection .
The effect of <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> , an increase in brain <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> , and an increase in renal excretion of <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> and <START:Chemical> urea <END> .
Intraventricular infusion of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> sufficient to raise the brain <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> to the same extent did not prevent the <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> nor affect the blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> concentrations .
Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> on blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> and the <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> was not prevented .
Thus , the reduction in blood and brain <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> and the prevention of <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> <START:Disease> coma <END> after <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> , can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> on renal function rather than its central action .
These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some <START:Disease> encephalopathic <END> patients receiving <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> .
<START:Disease> Cauda equina syndrome <END> after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> : a review of six cases of <START:Disease> cauda equina syndrome <END> reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993 - 1997 .
Six cases of <START:Disease> cauda equina syndrome <END> with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993 - 1997 .
All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
Five cases had single - shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block .
The dose of hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg . Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> of hyperbaric 5 % <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> .
In the other 3 cases , direct <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> was also probable , but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology .
All cases sustained permanent <START:Disease> neurological deficits <END> .
We recommend that hyperbaric <START:Chemical> lignocaine <END> should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2 % and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg .
Erythropoietin restores the <START:Disease> anemia <END> - induced reduction in <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> in rat <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
The aim of this study was to examine the impact of <START:Disease> anemia <END> prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) treatment on the <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in solid experimental <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
<START:Disease> Anemia <END> was induced using a single dose of <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> ( 50 mg / kg i . v . ) resulting in a long - lasting reduction ( 30 % ) of the hemoglobin concentration .
In a second group , the development of <START:Disease> anemia <END> was prevented by rHuEPO ( 1000 IU / kg ) administered s . c . three times / week starting 7 days before <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> application .
Four days after <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> treatment , <START:Disease> tumors <END> ( DS - <START:Disease> sarcoma <END> of the rat ) were implanted s . c . onto the hind food dorsum .
Neither <START:Chemical> carboplatin <END> nor rHuEPO treatment influenced <START:Disease> tumor <END> growth rate per se .
When <START:Disease> tumors <END> were treated with a single dose of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> ( 60 mg / kg i . p . ) 5 days after implantation , a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the <START:Disease> tumors <END> was observed .
In the <START:Disease> anemia <END> group , the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days versus 8 . 6 days ) .
In the group where <START:Disease> anemia <END> was prevented by rHuEPO treatment , growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls ( 13 . 3 days ) .
These results suggest that chemotherapy - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> reduces <START:Disease> cytotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> in <START:Disease> tumors <END> , whereas correction of <START:Disease> anemia <END> by rHuEPO treatment ( epoetin alpha ) increases the sensitivity , probably as a result of an improved <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply to <START:Disease> tumor <END> tissue .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> treatment for severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in immunocompromised children .
BACKGROUND : Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host .
The incidence of severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children , where case fatality rates as high as 50 % to 80 % have been reported .
There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> , nor are there any prospective randomized , controlled trials of potentially useful anti - adenovirus therapies .
Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> is limited to a few case reports and small series .
Experience is greatest with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> and <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> .
<START:Chemical> Ribavirin <END> , a <START:Chemical> guanosine <END> analogue , has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses , including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro .
<START:Chemical> Ribavirin <END> is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of <START:Disease> respiratory syncytial virus infection <END> , and orally in combination with interferon to treat <START:Disease> hepatitis C <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> is the treatment of choice for <START:Disease> infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses <END> .
The most common adverse effect of intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> is reversible mild <START:Disease> anemia <END> .
The use of <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> in severe <START:Disease> adenovirus infection <END> has been limited by adverse effects , the most significant of which is <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
OBJECTIVE : We report our experience with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> therapy for severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature .
DESIGN / METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> for documented severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> .
Two patients developed adenovirus <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> after cardiac and bone marrow transplants , respectively .
The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> for progressive disseminated disease .
An additional 3 children developed <START:Disease> adenovirus pneumonia <END> ; 2 were neonates , 1 of whom had partial <START:Disease> DiGeorge syndrome <END> .
The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> was administered on a compassionate - use protocol .
RESULTS : Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children : the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> and the immunocompetent neonate with <START:Disease> adenovirus pneumonia <END> .
The remaining 3 children died of <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> therapy was well tolerated .
Use of <START:Chemical> cidofovir <END> in 1 child was associated with <START:Disease> progressive renal failure <END> and <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> .
DISCUSSION : Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> , namely solid - organ and bone marrow transplant recipients , neonates , and children with <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> .
Although intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> was not effective for all children with severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in this series or in the literature , therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the <START:Disease> infection <END> .
Early identification , eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response .
CONCLUSIONS : Two of 5 children with severe <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> treated with intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> recovered .
The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction , may make earlier , more effective treatment of <START:Disease> adenovirus infection <END> possible .
Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of <START:Disease> adenovirus disease <END> in certain hosts , especially children , a large , multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti - adenoviral therapies , such as intravenous <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy .
<START:Chemical> Nicotine <END> potentiation of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in mice .
In the present study , effects of <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> on <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> in mice have been investigated .
<START:Chemical> Morphine <END> but not <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> induced a dose - dependent <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The response of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> was potentiated by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Intraperitoneal administration of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> , <START:Chemical> mecamylamine <END> , and <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> to mice reduced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by a combination of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> with <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Intracerebroventricular injection of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> , and <START:Chemical> naloxone <END> also decreased <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> morphine <END> plus <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> .
Intraperitoneal administration of <START:Chemical> atropine <END> , but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> , decreased the effect of a single dose of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
It was concluded that <START:Chemical> morphine <END> <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors , and the potentiation of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> induced by <START:Chemical> nicotine <END> may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms .
Production of autochthonous <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> in Lobund - Wistar rats by treatments with <START:Chemical> N - nitroso - N - methylurea <END> and <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> .
More than 50 % of Lobund - Wistar ( L - W ) strain rats developed large , palpable <START:Disease> prostate adenocarcinomas <END> ( <START:Disease> PAs <END> ) following treatments with <START:Chemical> N - nitroso - N - methylurea <END> ( CAS : 684 - 93 - 5 ) and <START:Chemical> testosterone propionate <END> [ ( <START:Chemical> TP <END> ) CAS : 57 - 85 - 2 ] , and most of the <START:Disease> tumor <END> - bearing rats manifested metastatic lesions .
The incubation periods averaged 10 . 6 months .
Within the same timeframe , no L - W rat developed a similar palpable <START:Disease> PA <END> when treated only with <START:Chemical> TP <END> .
In L - W rats , <START:Chemical> TP <END> acted as a <START:Disease> tumor <END> enhancement agent , with primary emphasis on the development of <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> , acting through central alpha - 2 adrenoceptors , prevents opiate - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> in the rat .
The highly - selective alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> ) is capable of inducing <START:Disease> muscle flaccidity <END> and anesthesia in rats and dogs .
Intense generalized <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists .
Although the neurochemistry of opiate - induced <START:Disease> rigidity <END> has yet to be fully elucidated , recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism .
In the present study , the authors determined if treatment with <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> prevents the <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> caused by high - dose <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> anesthesia in the rat .
Animals ( n = 42 ) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens : 1 ) L - MED ( the inactive L - isomer of <START:Chemical> medetomidine <END> ) , 30 micrograms / kg ; 2 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> , 10 micrograms / kg ; 3 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> , 30 micrograms / kg ; 4 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the central - acting alpha - 2 antagonist , <START:Chemical> idazoxan <END> [ 10 mg / kg ] ; 5 ) <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> [ 30 micrograms / kg ] and the peripheral - acting alpha - 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> DG - 5128 <END> [ 10 mg / kg ] , or ; 6 ) saline .
Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment .
Each rat was then injected with <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> ( <START:Chemical> ALF <END> , 0 . 5 mg / kg sc ) .
<START:Chemical> ALF <END> injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L - MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> prevented <START:Chemical> alfentanil <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> in a dose - dependent fashion .
The small EMG values obtained in the high - dose <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate .
The high - dose <START:Chemical> D - MED <END> animals were flaccid , <START:Disease> akinetic <END> , and lacked a <START:Disease> startle <END> response during the entire experimental period . ( ABSTRACT
TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )
<START:Chemical> Apomorphine <END> : an underutilized therapy for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Chemical> Apomorphine <END> was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951 , the potential of treating fluctuating <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> by subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> has only recently become the subject of systematic study .
A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and that <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> rescue injections can reliably revert off - periods even in patients with complex on - off motor swings .
Continuous subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> infusions can reduce daily off - time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add - on therapy with oral <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> agonists or COMT inhibitors .
Extended follow - up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long - term persistence of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> efficacy .
In addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> .
The main side effects of subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> complications play a lesser role .
Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> treatment in fluctuating <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use .
<START:Chemical> Etoposide <END> - related <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> .
The occurrence of a <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> is reported after chemotherapy containing <START:Chemical> etoposide <END> , in a man with no risk factors for <START:Disease> coronary heart disease <END> .
Possible causal mechanisms are discussed .
Relative efficacy and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> in oncology patients .
We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> netilmicin sulfate <END> or <START:Chemical> tobramycin sulfate <END> in conjunction with <START:Chemical> piperacillin sodium <END> in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe <START:Disease> infections <END> .
The two treatment regimens were equally efficacious .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxicity <END> occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> ( 17 % vs 11 % ) .
<START:Disease> Ototoxicity <END> occurred in four ( 9 . 5 % ) of 42 <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> and in 12 ( 22 % ) of 54 <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients .
Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms , three of four <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients .
The number of greater than or equal to 15 - dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15 - dB changes ( increases and decreases ) was significantly lower in <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - vs <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and <START:Chemical> piperacillin <END> - treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115 ) .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> - associated <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> was less severe and more often reversible with <START:Chemical> netilmicin <END> than with <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> .
Preservation of renal blood flow during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced with <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> in dogs .
The introduction of drugs that could induce <START:Disease> hypotension <END> with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy .
Specific <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - 1 , ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> 1 ) and <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - 2 ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> 2 ) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation .
<START:Chemical> Fenoldopam mesylate <END> is a specific DA 1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation .
The hypothesis that <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> could be used to induce <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested .
Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively , in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> and <START:Chemical> sodium <END> <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> in ten dogs under <START:Chemical> halothane <END> general anaesthesia .
Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 + / - 8 per cent from control with infusion of <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> ( 3 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) and 34 + / - 4 per cent with infusion of <START:Chemical> sodium <END> <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> ( 5 . 9 micrograms . kg - 1 . min - 1 ) ( NS ) .
Renal blood flow ( RBF ) increased during <START:Chemical> fenoldopam <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> 11 + / - 7 per cent and decreased 21 + / - 8 per cent during <START:Chemical> sodium <END> <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> ( P less than 0 . 01 ) .
Sodium <START:Chemical> nitroprusside <END> is a non - selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Fenoldopam is a selective <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> - 1 ( DA 1 ) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA 1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
Cardiovascular risk with <START:Chemical> cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> : general problem with substance specific differences ?
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> , <START:Disease> stroke <END> , <START:Disease> hypertension <END> and <START:Disease> heart failure <END> during treatment with <START:Chemical> cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> .
Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly , but not exclusively , in patients with concomitant risk factors .
<START:Chemical> Cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> cause complex changes in renal , vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention .
The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time .
A comparison of individual selective and unselective <START:Chemical> cyclooxygenase inhibitors <END> suggests substance - specific differences , which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by <START:Chemical> prostaglandin <END> - independent effects .
Diagnostic markers such as <START:Chemical> N - terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NT - proBNP <END> ) or high - sensitive C - reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk , thus avoiding the occurrence of serious <START:Disease> cardiovascular toxicity <END> .
Loss of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> decarboxylase mRNA - containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
In situ hybridization methods were used to determine if <START:Chemical> glutamic acid <END> decarboxylase ( GAD ) mRNA - containing neurons within the hilus of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to <START:Disease> seizure <END> - induced damage in a model of chronic <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Sprague - Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> , and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 week intervals after <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
In situ hybridization histochemistry , using a <START:Chemical> digoxigenin <END> - labeled GAD cRNA probe , demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus in the <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - treated rats as compared to controls at all time intervals .
Additional neuronanatomical studies , including <START:Chemical> cresyl violet <END> staining , <START:Disease> neuronal degeneration <END> methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons was related to <START:Disease> neuronal loss <END> rather than to a decrease in GAD mRNA levels .
The loss of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell layer .
Quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of GAD mRNA - containing neurons in the hilus of both groups of experimental animals .
No significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell layer .
The results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of GAD mRNA - containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to <START:Disease> seizure <END> - induced damage .
Such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of <START:Chemical> GABA <END> neurons .
Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> on canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> .
Using two - stage coronary ligation - , <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> - , and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced canine <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmias <END> , antiarrhythmic effects of <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> model was determined .
<START:Chemical> Cibenzoline <END> suppressed all the <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> , and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> induced by 24 - h coronary ligation , 48 - h coronary ligation , <START:Chemical> digitalis <END> , and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> were 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 9 ( by 8 mg / kg i . v . ) , 1 . 6 + / - 0 . 5 ( by 8 mg / kg i . v . ) , 0 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 ( by 2 mg / kg i . v . ) , and 3 . 5 + / - 1 . 3 ( by 5 mg / kg i . v . ) micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - SDM , n = 6 - 7 ) .
The concentration for <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> - induced <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> was significantly higher than those for the other types of <START:Disease> arrhythmias <END> .
This pharmacological profile is similar to those of <START:Chemical> mexiletine <END> and <START:Chemical> tocainide <END> , and all three drugs have central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant action .
Because <START:Chemical> cibenzoline <END> had only weak <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> and sinus node <START:Disease> depressive <END> effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> dogs , its clinical usefulness is expected .
Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - induced rat <START:Disease> pituitary tumors <END> may mediate <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> - initiated <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis .
<START:Chemical> Estrogens <END> , which have been associated with several types of human and animal <START:Disease> cancers <END> , can induce <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats .
The mechanistic details of <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis induction , during <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> , are still unknown .
To elucidate the role of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> in the regulation of <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats , the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen ( FVIIIRAg ) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor / vascular permeability factor ( VEGF / VPF ) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis .
The expression of VEGF receptor ( VEGFR - 2 / Flk - 1 / KDR ) was also examined by immunohistochemistry .
The results demonstrated that <START:Chemical> 17 beta - estradiol <END> ( <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure .
The high <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF / VPF protein expression in the <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( OVEX ) rats .
VEGF / VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( UEA 1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non - endothelial cells .
After 15 days of <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> exposure , VEGF / VPF protein expression , in the non - endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels .
The function of non - endothelial - derived VEGF is not clear .
Furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR - 2 ( flk - 1 / KDR ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of <START:Chemical> E 2 <END> exposure .
These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor ( VEGFR - 2 ) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> induced <START:Disease> tumor <END> angiogenesis in the rat pituitary .
<START:Chemical> Steroid <END> structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti - <START:Disease> amnesic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> pregnenolone sulphate <END> in the passive avoidance task in rats .
<START:Chemical> Pregnenolone sulphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> ) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory - enhancing neurosteroids to be examined in rodent learning studies , with particular importance in the ageing process .
The mechanism by which this endogenous <START:Chemical> steroid <END> enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems .
This hypothesis stems from findings that <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> is a potent positive modulator of <START:Chemical> N - methyl - d - aspartate <END> receptors ( NMDARs ) and a negative modulator of <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acid <END> ( A ) receptors ( <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs ) .
Moreover , <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> is able to reverse the <START:Disease> amnesic <END> - like effects of NMDAR and <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) R ligands .
To investigate this hypothesis , the present study in rats examined the memory - altering abilities of structural analogs of <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> , which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and / or <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) R function .
The analogs tested were : <START:Chemical> 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate <END> ( an agent that is inactive at <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , <START:Chemical> epipregnanolone ( [ 3 beta - hydroxy - 5 beta - pregnan - 20 - one ] sulphate <END> , an inhibitor of both <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) , and a newly synthesized ( - ) <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> enantiomer ( which is identical to <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> in effects on <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ( A ) Rs and NMDARs ) .
The memory - enhancing effects of <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
Both <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> and its ( - ) enantiomer blocked the effects of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> .
The results show that , unlike <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> , <START:Chemical> 11 - ketopregnenolone sulphate <END> and <START:Chemical> epipregnanolone sulphate <END> failed to block the effect of <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> , suggesting that altering the modulation of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors diminishes the memory - enhancing effects of <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> .
Moreover , enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural <START:Chemical> PREGS <END> to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing <START:Chemical> scopolamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> amnesia <END> .
These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
BACKGROUND : Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short - term follow - up .
METHODS : Forty patients with <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> underwent serial , detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal ( " off " period ) and while taking their optimal medical regimens ( " on " period ) .
All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months ; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year , and 11 at two years .
RESULTS : The percent improvements at six months were as follows : off - period score for overall motor function , 28 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 38 percent ) , with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs ; off - period score for activities of daily living , 29 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 19 to 39 percent ) ; on - period score for contralateral <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , 82 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 72 to 91 percent ) ; and on - period score for ipsilateral <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> , 44 percent ( 95 percent confidence interval , 29 to 59 percent ) .
The improvements in <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> and the total scores for off - period <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> , contralateral <START:Disease> bradykinesia <END> , and <START:Disease> rigidity <END> were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years .
The improvement in ipsilateral <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> was lost after one year , and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months .
Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery .
The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated , and there were no significant changes in the use of medication .
CONCLUSIONS : In late - stage <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> , pallidotomy significantly reduces <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> and off - period disability .
Much of the benefit is sustained at two years , although some improvements , such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms , wane within the first year .
The on - period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy .
Passage of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> into the brain around <START:Disease> gliomas <END> : a potential cause of rebound phenomenon .
A study on 21 patients .
AIM : Widespread use of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> to reduce <START:Disease> brain edema <END> and lower <START:Disease> elevated ICP <END> in <START:Disease> brain tumor <END> patients continues to be afflicted by the so - called rebound phenomenon .
Leakage of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound .
This has only been demonstrated experimentally in animals .
As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> into the brain after administration to 21 <START:Disease> brain tumor <END> patients .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> Mannitol <END> ( 18 % solution ; 1 g / kg ) was administered as a bolus to patients ( ten had <START:Disease> malignant glioma <END> , seven brain <START:Disease> metastases <END> and four <START:Disease> meningioma <END> ) about 30 minutes before craniotomy .
During resection , a sample of the surrounding <START:Disease> edematous <END> white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample .
<START:Chemical> Mannitol <END> concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al .
RESULTS : In most <START:Disease> glioma <END> patients , <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma ( mean 3 . 5 times ) .
In <START:Disease> meningioma <END> and <START:Disease> metastases <END> patients plasma concentrations of <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells .
CONCLUSIONS : The results of our study show that even after a single bolus , <START:Chemical> mannitol <END> may leak through the altered BBB near <START:Disease> gliomas <END> , reversing the initial plasma - to - blood osmotic gradient , aggravating peritumoral <START:Disease> edema <END> and promoting rebound of ICP .
Cardiac transplantation : improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol .
The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients .
In group I , <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17 . 5 mg / kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng / ml .
In group II , <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by <START:Chemical> azathioprine <END> , which was used for the first postoperative week .
Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood <START:Chemical> urea nitrogen <END> and serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> levels .
Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> secondary to long - term therapy with <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> .
Despite this improvement in late renal function , group II still shows a slow rise in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> .
We think that even these lower dosages of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> can cause chronic <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect .
Effects of acute <START:Chemical> steroid <END> administration on ventilatory and peripheral muscles in rats .
Occasional case reports have shown that acute <START:Disease> myopathy <END> may occur in patients treated with massive doses of <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
The mechanism of this <START:Disease> myopathy <END> is poorly understood .
Therefore , 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline ( C ) , <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> M <END> ) , or <START:Chemical> triamcinolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> T <END> ) 80 mg / kg / d for 5 d .
Nutritional intake , measured daily in 15 animals , showed a significant <START:Disease> reduction of food intake <END> in the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> - treated groups ( - 50 and - 79 % in <START:Chemical> M <END> and <START:Chemical> T <END> , respectively ) .
This was associated with a similar <START:Disease> loss in body weight <END> .
In the 45 remaining animals , diaphragm contractility and histopathologic features of several muscles were studied .
Weights of respiratory and peripheral muscles were similarly decreased after <START:Chemical> steroid <END> treatment .
Maximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group ( 653 + / - 174 g / cm ( 2 )) than in the <START:Chemical> M <END> group ( 837 + / - 171 g / cm ( 2 ) ; p < 0 . 05 ) and the <START:Chemical> T <END> group ( 765 + / - 145 g / cm ( 2 ) , NS ) .
Half - relaxation time was prolonged in both <START:Chemical> steroid <END> groups , and time to peak tension was longer with <START:Chemical> M <END> , whereas <START:Disease> tetanic <END> tensions were similar .
<START:Chemical> Steroid <END> treatment also induced a leftward shift of the force - frequency curve at 25 and 50 Hz when compared with saline treatment ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
ATPase staining of the diaphragm , scalenus medius , and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber <START:Disease> atrophy <END> in the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa <START:Disease> atrophy <END> with <START:Chemical> T <END> , whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of <START:Disease> necrosis <END> .
Finally , a pair - fed ( PF ) study , performed in 18 rats ( C , <START:Chemical> T <END> , and PF ) , showed that <START:Disease> muscle atrophy <END> was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in <START:Chemical> T <END> - treated animals .
We conclude that ( 1 ) short - term treatment with massive doses of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting ; ( 2 ) both types of <START:Chemical> steroids <END> induced predominantly type IIb <START:Disease> atrophy <END> , resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties ; ( 3 ) neither <START:Chemical> steroid <END> caused muscle <START:Disease> necrosis <END> ; ( 4 ) type IIb <START:Disease> atrophy <END> was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone .
Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The inferior colliculus ( IC ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system .
Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> microinjection causes freezing , escape - like behavior , and immobility .
However , the nature of this immobility is still unclear .
The present study examined the influence of excitatory <START:Chemical> amino acid <END> - mediated mechanisms in the IC on the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by the <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor blocker <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> administered systemically ( 1 or 0 . 5 mg / kg ) in rats .
<START:Chemical> Haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor antagonists , <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> ( 15 or 30 mmol / 0 . 5 microl ) and <START:Chemical> AP 7 <END> ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) , or of the <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor agonist <START:Chemical> N - methyl - d - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> , 20 or 30 nmol / 0 . 5 microl ) .
The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> and <START:Chemical> AP 7 <END> previous to systemic injections of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> significantly attenuated the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar .
Accordingly , intracollicular microinjection of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> increased the latency to step down the bar .
These findings suggest that <START:Chemical> glutamate <END> - mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and participate in the regulation of motor activity .
<START:Chemical> Acetazolamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Gerstmann syndrome <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> confusion <END> induced by <START:Chemical> acetazolamide <END> is a well known adverse drug reaction in patients with <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> .
We report a case of <START:Chemical> acetazolamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> Gerstmann syndrome <END> in a patient with normal renal function , to highlight predisposing factors that are frequently overlooked .
<START:Disease> Chorea <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oral contraception <END> .
Three patients developed <START:Disease> chorea <END> while receiving <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
Two were young patients whose <START:Disease> chorea <END> developed long after treatment had been started and disappeared soon after it had been discontinued .
The third patient had acute <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> chorea <END> after prolonged <START:Chemical> oral contraception <END> .
Prolonged administration of female sex hormones is a possible cause of <START:Disease> chorea <END> in women who have not previously had <START:Disease> chorea <END> or <START:Disease> rheumatic fever <END> .
Possible <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> - associated <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of persistent <START:Disease> hiccups <END> associated by <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> therapy .
CASE SUMMARY : A 76 - year - old man presented with persistent <START:Disease> hiccups <END> after beginning <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> for the treatment of <START:Disease> pharyngitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Hiccups <END> were persistent and exhausting .
Discontinuation of <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> and therapy with <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> finally resolved <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
No organic cause of <START:Disease> hiccups <END> was identified despite extensive investigation .
DISCUSSION : Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
Corticosteroids ( <START:Chemical> dexamethasone <END> and <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ) , <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> ( <START:Chemical> midazolam <END> ) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
Few cases of drug - induced <START:Disease> hiccups <END> have been reported related to <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antimicrobials .
Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible ( score 5 points ) , mostly because of the close temporal sequence , previous reports on this reaction with other <START:Chemical> macrolides <END> and the absence of any alternative explanation for <START:Disease> hiccups <END> .
Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by <START:Chemical> azithromycin <END> could be the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> hiccups <END> in our patient .
CONCLUSIONS : Diagnosis of drug - induced <START:Disease> hiccups <END> is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination .
However , <START:Chemical> macrolide <END> antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with <START:Disease> hiccups <END> and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side - effect .
Neural correlates of <START:Chemical> S - ketamine <END> induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> during overt continuous verbal fluency .
The glutamatergic <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
Administered to healthy volunteers , a subanesthetic dose of the non - competitive <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor antagonist <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
In patients with <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> , <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> exacerbates the core symptoms of illness , supporting the hypothesis of a <START:Disease> glutamatergic dysfunction <END> .
In a counterbalanced , placebo - controlled , double - blind study design , healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic <START:Chemical> S - ketamine <END> infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected .
During the scanning period , subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks ( phonological , lexical and semantic ) .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> - induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> elicited <START:Disease> psychosis <END> like psychopathology .
Post - hoc t - tests revealed significant differences between placebo and <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency , while the phonological domain remained unaffected .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency , but not for semantic verbal fluency .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> , particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions .
Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
Magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral <START:Disease> venous thrombosis <END> secondary to " low - dose " birth control pills .
The clinical and radiographic features of cerebral <START:Disease> deep venous thrombosis <END> in a 21 - year - old white woman are presented .
This nulliparous patient presented with relatively mild clinical symptoms and progressing mental status changes .
The only known risk factor was " low - dose " <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> pills .
The magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) showed increased signal intensity from the internal cerebral veins , vein of Galen , and straight sinus .
The diagnosis was confirmed by arterial angiography .
Time trends in <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - associated <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
The annual incidence of <START:Chemical> warfarin <END> - related <START:Disease> bleeding <END> at Brigham and Women ' s Hospital increased from 0 . 97 / 1 , 000 patient admissions in the first time period ( January 1995 to October 1998 ) to 1 . 19 / 1 , 000 patient admissions in the second time period ( November 1998 to August 2002 ) of this study .
The proportion of patients with major and <START:Disease> intracranial bleeding <END> increased from 20 . 2 % and 1 . 9 % , respectively , in the first time period , to 33 . 3 % and 7 . 8 % , respectively , in the second .
Contribution of the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in rostral and intermediate - caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats .
The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone .
Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method , which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance ( MMG ) of the rat ' s hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity ( EMG ) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint : gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior .
<START:Disease> Muscle rigidity <END> was induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 2 . 5 mg / kg i . p . ) .
<START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - dichlorokynurenic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DCKA <END> ) , a selective <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site antagonist , injected in doses of 2 . 5 and 4 . 5 microg / 0 . 5 microl bilaterally , into the rostral region of the striatum , decreased both the <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> ( MMG ) and the enhanced electromyographic activity ( EMG ) .
<START:Chemical> 5 , 7 - DCKA <END> injected bilaterally in a dose of 4 . 5 microg / 0 . 5 microl into the intermediate - caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> had no effect on the muscle tone .
The present results suggest that blockade of the <START:Chemical> glycine <END> site of <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug .
<START:Chemical> Valsartan <END> , a new <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> antagonist for the treatment of essential <START:Disease> hypertension <END> : a comparative study of the efficacy and safety against <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To compare the antihypertensive efficacy of a new <START:Chemical> angiotensin II <END> antagonist , <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> , with a reference therapy , <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> .
METHODS : One hundred sixty - eight adult outpatients with mild to moderate <START:Disease> hypertension <END> were randomly allocated in double - blind fashion and equal number to receive 80 mg <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> or 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> for 12 weeks .
After 8 weeks of therapy , in patients whose blood pressure remained uncontrolled , 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> was added to the initial therapy .
Patients were assessed at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure at 8 weeks .
Secondary variables included change in sitting systolic blood pressure and responder rates .
RESULTS : Both <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> and <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> were effective at lowering blood pressure at 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks .
Similar decreases were observed in both groups , with no statistically significant differences between the groups for any variable analyzed .
For the primary variable the difference was 0 . 5 mm Hg in favor of <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> ( p = 0 . 68 ; 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 7 to 1 . 7 ) .
Responder rates at 8 weeks were 66 . 7 % for <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> and 60 . 2 % for <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ( p = 0 . 39 ) .
Both treatments were well tolerated .
The incidence of drug - related dependent <START:Disease> edema <END> was somewhat higher in the <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> group , particularly at a dose of 10 mg per day ( 2 . 4 % for 80 mg <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> ; 3 . 6 % for 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ; 0 % for <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> plus 5 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ; 14 . 3 % for 10 mg <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> ) .
CONCLUSIONS : The data show that <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> is at least as effective as <START:Chemical> amlodipine <END> in the treatment of mild to moderate <START:Disease> hypertension <END> .
The results also show <START:Chemical> valsartan <END> to be well tolerated and suggest that it is not associated with side effects characteristic of this comparator class , <START:Chemical> dihydropyridine <END> <START:Chemical> calcium <END> antagonists .
Open - label assessment of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> for the treatment of acute bacterial <START:Disease> sinusitis <END> in adults .
PURPOSE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> ( 500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days ) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial <START:Disease> sinusitis <END> .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers .
All patients had a pre - therapy Gram ' s stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy .
Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results .
Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre - therapy pathogen ( s ) .
RESULTS : The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Moraxella catarrhalis .
Of 300 clinically evaluable patients , 175 ( 58 % ) were cured and 90 ( 30 % ) were improved at the post - therapy evaluation , resulting in a clinical success rate of 88 % .
Thirty - five patients ( 12 % ) clinically failed treatment .
The microbiologic eradication rate ( presumed plus documented ) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92 % .
Microbiologic eradication rates ( presumed plus documented ) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93 % ( M .
catarrhalis ) to 100 % ( S . pneumoniae ) at the post - therapy visit .
All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post - therapy returned for a long - term follow - up visit ; 243 ( 92 % ) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy ; and 21 ( 8 % ) had a relapse of symptoms .
Adverse events considered to be related to <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> administration were reported by 29 patients ( 9 % ) .
The most common drug - related adverse events were <START:Disease> diarrhea <END> , <START:Disease> flatulence <END> , and <START:Disease> nausea <END> ; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity .
CONCLUSION : The results of this study indicate that <START:Chemical> levofloxacin <END> 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial <START:Disease> sinusitis <END> .
Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral <START:Chemical> prostacyclin <END> analogue <START:Chemical> beraprost <END> and phosphodiesterase inhibitor <START:Chemical> cilostazol <END> .
Among various oral antiplatelets , a combination of a novel <START:Chemical> prostacyclin <END> analogue <START:Chemical> beraprost <END> ( <START:Chemical> BPT <END> ) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor <START:Chemical> cilostazol <END> ( <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular <START:Chemical> cAMP <END> ( <START:Chemical> cyclic adenosine 3 ' , 5 ' - monophosphate <END> ) .
Thereby , a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted .
Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take <START:Chemical> BPT <END> / <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> in the following schedule ; <START:Chemical> BPT <END> : 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t . i . d . from day 7 to 14 , <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> : 200 mg t . i . d . from day 3 to 14 .
At various time intervals , physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> and determination of intraplatelet <START:Chemical> cAMP <END> were performed .
Throughout the observation period , no significant alteration in vital signs was observed .
Seven out of 12 subjects experienced <START:Disease> headache <END> of a short duration accompanying <START:Disease> facial flush <END> in one and <START:Disease> nausea <END> in one , especially after ingestion of <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> .
All of these symptoms , probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents , were of mild degree and no special treatment was required .
Intraplatelet <START:Chemical> cAMP <END> content was gradually but significantly increased to 9 . 84 + / - 4 . 59 pmol per 10 ( 9 ) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value ( 6 . 87 + / - 2 . 25 pmol ) .
The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted .
In conclusion , the combined administration of <START:Chemical> BPT <END> / <START:Chemical> CLZ <END> is safe at doses used in the study , though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated .
Continuous subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> to prevent <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hemorrhagic cystitis <END> .
<START:Disease> Hemorrhagic cystitis <END> is a major potential <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> that can be prevented by administering <START:Chemical> mesna <END> along with the cytotoxic agent .
<START:Chemical> Mesna <END> is generally administered by the intravenous route , although experience with oral delivery of the drug has increased .
The continuous subcutaneous administration of <START:Chemical> mesna <END> has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access .
In addition , subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary <START:Chemical> mesna <END> concentrations , such as in a patient taking oral <START:Chemical> mesna <END> who experiences severe <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> emesis <END> and is unable to absorb the drug .
Limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous <START:Chemical> mesna <END> administration suggests it is a safe , practical , and economic method of drug delivery that permits <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting .
<START:Chemical> 5 flourouracil <END> - induced <START:Disease> apical ballooning syndrome <END> : a case report .
The <START:Disease> apical ballooning syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> ABS <END> ) is a recently described stress - mediated <START:Disease> acute cardiac syndrome <END> characterized by transient wall - motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with <START:Disease> hyperkinesis <END> of the basal left ventricular ( LV ) segments without obstructive <START:Disease> epicardial coronary disease <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxicity <END> is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents .
However , there are no reports of <START:Disease> ABS <END> secondary to chemotherapeutic agents .
We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic <START:Disease> cancer <END> .
A 79 - year - old woman presented with typical <START:Disease> ischemic <END> <START:Disease> chest pain <END> , elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST - segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram .
She underwent recent chemotherapy with <START:Chemical> fluorouracil <END> for metastatic <START:Disease> colorectal cancer <END> .
Echocardiography revealed a wall - motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared <START:Disease> akinetic <END> .
Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions .
The patient was stabilized with medical therapy .
Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic .
Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical <START:Disease> akinesis <END> .
Pathogenetic mechanisms of <START:Disease> cardiac complications <END> in <START:Disease> cancer <END> patients undergoing chemotherapy include <START:Disease> coronary vasospasm <END> , endothelial damage and consequent <START:Disease> thrombus <END> formation .
In our patient , both supraphysiologic levels of plasma <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> and stress related neuropeptides caused by <START:Disease> cancer <END> diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of <START:Disease> ABS <END> .
Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> - induced <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> in the rat .
Whereas <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> is a well - known side effect that is associated with high - dose <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> anesthesia , a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism ( s ) .
We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon , using male Sprague - Dawley rats anesthetized with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
Under proper control of respiration , body temperature and end - tidal <START:Chemical> CO 2 <END> , intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> ( 50 or 100 micrograms / kg ) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles .
Such an induced <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha - adrenoceptor blocker , <START:Chemical> prazosin <END> .
Microinjection of <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> ( 2 . 5 micrograms / 50 nl ) directly into this pontine nucleus , on the other hand , elicited discernible electromyographic excitation .
It is speculated that the induction of <START:Disease> muscular rigidity <END> by <START:Chemical> fentanyl <END> may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons .
<START:Disease> Nephrotoxic <END> effects in high - risk patients undergoing angiography .
BACKGROUND : The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
Whether iso - osmolar contrast medium is less <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> than low - osmolar contrast medium in high - risk patients is uncertain .
METHODS : We conducted a randomized , double - blind , prospective , multicenter study comparing the <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> effects of an iso - osmolar , dimeric , nonionic contrast medium , <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> , with those of a low - osmolar , nonionic , monomeric contrast medium , <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> .
The study involved 129 patients with <START:Disease> diabetes <END> with serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentrations of 1 . 5 to 3 . 5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography .
The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration during the three days after angiography .
Other end points were an increase in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , and a change in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration from day 0 to day 7 .
RESULTS : The <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration increased significantly less in patients who received <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> .
From day 0 to day 3 , the mean peak increase in <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> was 0 . 13 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group and 0 . 55 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( P = 0 . 001 ; the increase with <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> minus the increase with <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> , - 0 . 42 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 73 to - 0 . 22 ] ) .
Two of the 64 patients in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group ( 3 percent ) had an increase in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration of 0 . 5 mg per deciliter or more , as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( 26 percent ) ( P = 0 . 002 ; odds ratio for such an increase in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group , 0 . 09 [ 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 02 to 0 . 41 ] ) .
No patient receiving <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> had an increase of 1 . 0 mg per deciliter or more , but 10 patients in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( 15 percent ) did .
The mean change in the <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0 . 07 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group and 0 . 24 mg per deciliter in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group ( P = 0 . 003 ; value in the <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> group minus the value in the <START:Chemical> iohexol <END> group , - 0 . 17 mg per deciliter [ 95 percent confidence interval , - 0 . 34 to - 0 . 07 ] ) .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Nephropathy <END> induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high - risk patients when <START:Chemical> iodixanol <END> is used rather than a low - osmolar , nonionic contrast medium .
<START:Chemical> Isoproterenol <END> induces primary loss of dystrophin in rat hearts : correlation with <START:Disease> myocardial injury <END> .
The mechanism of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> is unknown , but a mismatch of <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> supply vs . demand following coronary <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> myocardial hyperactivity <END> is the best explanation for the complex morphological alterations observed .
Severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes have been demonstrated to be caused by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> .
Taking into account that the sarcolemmal integrity is stabilized by the dystrophin - glycoprotein complex ( DGC ) that connects actin and laminin in contractile machinery and extracellular matrix and by integrins , this study tests the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> affects sarcolemmal stability through changes in the DGC and integrins .
We found different sensitivity of the DGC and integrin to <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> subcutaneous administration .
Immunofluorescent staining revealed that dystrophin is the most sensitive among the structures connecting the actin in the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix .
The sarcomeric actin dissolution occurred after the reduction or loss of dystrophin .
Subsequently , after lysis of myofilaments , gamma - sarcoglycan , beta - dystroglycan , beta 1 - integrin , and laminin alpha - 2 expressions were reduced followed by their breakdown , as epiphenomena of the myocytolytic process .
In conclusion , administration of <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> to rats results in primary loss of dystrophin , the most sensitive among the structural proteins that form the DGC that connects the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton in cardiomyocyte .
These changes , related to <START:Disease> ischaemic injury <END> , explain the severe alterations in the structural integrity of the sarcolemma of cardiomyocytes and hence severe and irreversible injury induced by <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> .
Long - term effects of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> on the peripheral nervous system .
Forty patients with <START:Disease> Non - Hodgkin ' s Lymphoma <END> treated with <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> between 1984 and 1990 ( cumulative dose 12 mg in 18 - 24 weeks ) were investigated in order to evaluate the long term effects of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> on the peripheral nervous system .
The patients were interviewed with emphasis on <START:Disease> neuropathic symptoms <END> .
Physical and quantitative sensory examination with determination of vibratory perception and thermal discrimination thresholds were performed , four to 77 months ( median 34 months ) after <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> treatment .
Twenty - seven patients reported <START:Disease> neuropathic symptoms <END> .
In 13 of these 27 patients symptoms were still present at the time of examination .
In these patients sensory signs and symptoms predominated .
In the other 14 patients symptoms had been present in the past .
Symptoms persisted maximally 40 months since cessation of therapy .
There was no age difference between patients with and without complaints at the time of examination .
Normal reflexes were found in two third of patients .
Neuropathic complaints were not very troublesome on the long term .
It is concluded that with the above mentioned <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> dose schedule signs and symptoms of <START:Chemical> vincristine <END> <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> are reversible for a great deal and prognosis is fairly good .
Intraocular pressure in patients with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> fluocinolone acetonide <END> implants .
OBJECTIVE : To report the incidence and management of <START:Disease> elevated intraocular pressure <END> ( IOP ) in patients with <START:Disease> uveitis <END> treated with the <START:Chemical> fluocinolone acetonide <END> ( <START:Chemical> FA <END> ) intravitreal implant .
DESIGN : Pooled data from 3 multicenter , double - masked , randomized , controlled , phase 2 b / 3 clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the 0 . 59 - mg or 2 . 1 - mg <START:Chemical> FA <END> intravitreal implant or standard therapy were analyzed .
RESULTS : During the 3 - year follow - up , 71 . 0 % of implanted eyes had an IOP increase of 10 mm Hg or more than baseline and 55 . 1 % , 24 . 7 % , and 6 . 2 % of eyes reached an IOP of 30 mm Hg or more , 40 mm Hg or more , and 50 mm Hg or more , respectively .
Topical IOP - lowering medication was administered in 74 . 8 % of implanted eyes , and IOP - lowering surgeries , most of which were trabeculectomies ( 76 . 2 % ) , were performed on 36 . 6 % of implanted eyes .
Intraocular pressure - lowering surgeries were considered a success ( postoperative IOP of 6 - 21 mm Hg with or without additional IOP - lowering medication ) in 85 . 1 % of eyes at 1 year .
The rate of <START:Disease> hypotony <END> ( IOP < / = 5 mm Hg ) following IOP - lowering surgery ( 42 . 5 % ) was not different from that of implanted eyes not subjected to surgery ( 35 . 4 % ) ( P = . 09 ) .
CONCLUSION : Elevated IOP is a significant complication with the FA intravitreal implant but may be controlled with medication and surgery .
<START:Disease> Ventricular fibrillation <END> from <START:Chemical> diatrizoate <END> with and without chelating agents .
The <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> Renografin 76 % <END> was compared with that of <START:Chemical> Hypaque 76 % <END> by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dogs .
<START:Chemical> Renografin <END> contains the chelating agents <START:Chemical> sodium citrate <END> and <START:Chemical> disodium edetate <END> , while <START:Chemical> Hypaque <END> contains <START:Chemical> calcium disodium edetate <END> and no <START:Chemical> sodium citrate <END> .
<START:Disease> Ventricular fibrillation <END> occurred significantly more often with <START:Chemical> Renografin <END> , suggesting that chelating agents contribute to <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in coronary angiography .
The attenuating effect of <START:Chemical> carteolol hydrochloride <END> , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats .
It is known that beta - adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> , one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment .
Neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , a model of neuroleptic - induced extrapyramidal side effects , was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> in humans , although neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic - induced <START:Disease> akathisia <END> .
Therefore , the effects of <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> , a beta - adrenoceptor antagonist , on <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> and <START:Chemical> biperiden <END> , a muscarinic receptor antagonist .
<START:Chemical> Carteolol <END> , as well as <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> and <START:Chemical> biperiden <END> , inhibited the <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The inhibitory effect of <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> was almost comparable to that of <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , but was weaker than that of <START:Chemical> biperiden <END> .
<START:Chemical> Carteolol <END> did not evoke postsynaptic <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and <START:Disease> hyperlocomotion <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Carteolol <END> did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> on <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats .
In addition , <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> did not evoke 5 - HT 1 A receptor - stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptophan <END> - induced head twitch in rats .
Finally , <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> did not inhibit <START:Chemical> physostigmine <END> - induced lethality in rats .
These results strongly suggest that <START:Chemical> carteolol <END> improves <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> via its beta - adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of <START:Disease> akathisia <END> without attenuating neuroleptic - induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor antagonistic activity .
Dose - related beneficial and adverse effects of dietary <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> on <START:Chemical> organophosphorus <END> - induced delayed <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> in chickens .
<START:Chemical> Tri - ortho - tolyl phosphate <END> ( <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> ) , 360 mg / kg , po , and <START:Chemical> 0 , 0 ' - diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFP <END> ) , 1 mg / kg sc , were administered to adult White Leghorn chickens 24 hr after they were placed on diets containing 0 to 300 ppm <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> .
Supplemented diets were continued until clinical signs and lesions of delayed <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> appeared .
Although low concentrations ( less than or equal to 50 ppm ) of <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> had beneficial effects on <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> - induced <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> , greater than or equal to 200 ppm exacerbated clinical signs in chickens given either <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> .
<START:Disease> Neurotoxic <END> esterase activities 24 hr after <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> were less than 20 % of values measured in chickens not given <START:Chemical> organophosphorous <END> compounds .
Chickens given 200 ppm <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> without <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> had significantly elevated activity of plasma cholinesterase and significantly inhibited activity of liver carboxylesterase .
<START:Disease> Degenerating myelinated fibers <END> were also evident in distal levels of the peripheral nerves of chickens given <START:Chemical> TOTP <END> or <START:Chemical> DFP <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cholesteryl hemisuccinate <END> treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> , <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> , <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> , <START:Chemical> chloroform <END> and <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> .
In addition to its use as a stabilizer / rigidifier of membranes , <START:Chemical> cholesteryl hemisuccinate <END> , <START:Chemical> tris salt <END> ( <START:Chemical> CS <END> ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> CCl 4 <END> ) .
To further our understanding of the mechanism of <START:Chemical> CS <END> cytoprotection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of <START:Chemical> CS <END> and the non - hydrolyzable ether form of <START:Chemical> CS <END> , <START:Chemical> gamma - cholesteryloxybutyric acid <END> , <START:Chemical> tris salt <END> ( <START:Chemical> CSE <END> ) against <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> - , <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> - , <START:Chemical> carbon tetrachloride <END> - , <START:Chemical> chloroform <END> - and <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The results of these studies demonstrated that <START:Chemical> CS <END> - mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chemical .
A 24 - h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of <START:Chemical> CS <END> ( 100 mg / kg , i . p . ) , resulted in significant protection against the <START:Disease> hepatotoxic <END> effects of <START:Chemical> CCl 4 <END> , <START:Chemical> CHCl 3 <END> , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> and <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> and against the lethal ( and presumably <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> ) effect of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> administration .
Maximal <START:Chemical> CS <END> - mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult .
These data suggest that <START:Chemical> CS <END> intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death .
The mechanism of <START:Chemical> CS <END> protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against <START:Chemical> galactosamine <END> <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> ) .
However , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that <START:Chemical> CS <END> administration inhibits chemical bioactivation .
Our findings do suggest that <START:Chemical> CS <END> - mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic <START:Chemical> CS <END> molecule ( non - hydrolyzable <START:Chemical> CSE <END> was as protective as <START:Chemical> CS <END> ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .
Protective effect of <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> against <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> vestibulotoxicity <END> in the guinea pig .
This study investigated alleviation of <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> vestibulotoxicity <END> by <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> in guinea pigs .
<START:Chemical> Edaravone <END> , a free radical scavenger , has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat <START:Disease> cerebral infarction <END> .
<START:Chemical> Streptomycin <END> was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h , and <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> ( n = 8 ) or saline ( n = 6 ) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 days .
We observed horizontal vestibulo - ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function .
Animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> edaravone <END> suppresses <START:Chemical> streptomycin <END> - induced <START:Disease> vestibulotoxicity <END> .
Protective effect of <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> on <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> induced <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> in elderly patients .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the possible protective effects of <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> .
METHODS : Forty - five hospitalized elderly patients ( > 65 years old ) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID ) were randomly assigned to receive either <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> , 150 mg / day ( Group A ) , or <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> 150 mg / day plus <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> at 0 . 6 mg / day ( Group B ) .
Laboratory variables of renal function [ serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , <START:Chemical> blood urea nitrogen <END> ( <START:Chemical> BUN <END> ) and electrolytes ] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days , until termination of the study ( a period of at least 6 days ) .
Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of <START:Disease> pain <END> .
RESULTS : Forty - two patients completed the study , 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B .
<START:Chemical> BUN <END> and <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> increased by > 50 % of baseline levels in 54 and 45 % of Group A patients , respectively , compared to only 20 and 10 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
<START:Chemical> Potassium <END> ( <START:Chemical> K <END> ) increment of 0 . 6 mEq / l or more was observed in 50 % of Group A , but in only 15 % of Group B patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
The mean increments in <START:Chemical> BUN <END> , <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> , and <START:Chemical> K <END> were reduced by 63 , 80 , and 42 % , respectively , in Group B patients compared to Group A .
Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups .
CONCLUSION : Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing <START:Chemical> indomethacin <END> related <START:Disease> renal dysfunction <END> .
Addition of <START:Chemical> misoprostol <END> can minimize this <START:Disease> renal impairment <END> without affecting <START:Disease> pain <END> control .
Experimental <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> : risk of concomitant chemotherapy .
The role of <START:Chemical> cyclosporine <END> ( <START:Chemical> CSA <END> ) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> was evaluated in rats .
Administration of 20 mg / kg / day <START:Chemical> CSA <END> for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man .
The combined administration of <START:Chemical> CSA <END> and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a <START:Disease> nephrotoxic <END> potential , such as <START:Chemical> gentamicin <END> ( at therapeutic doses ) , <START:Chemical> amphothericin B <END> and <START:Chemical> ketoconazole <END> , which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients , did not aggravate the <START:Chemical> CSA <END> induced <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in the rat model .
<START:Chemical> Gentamicin <END> at toxic doses , however , increased <START:Chemical> CSA <END> <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
Thus , the <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> induced by <START:Chemical> CSA <END> has a different pathogenetic mechanism .
<START:Chemical> Tiapride <END> in <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> involuntary movements <END> .
<START:Chemical> Tiapride <END> , a substituted <START:Chemical> benzamide <END> derivative closely related to <START:Chemical> metoclopramide <END> , reduced <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced peak dose <START:Disease> involuntary movements <END> in 16 patients with <START:Disease> idiopathic Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
However , an unacceptable increase in disability from <START:Disease> Parkinsonism <END> with aggravation of end - of - dose <START:Disease> akinesia <END> led to its cessation in 14 patients .
<START:Chemical> Tiapride <END> had no effect on <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced early morning of " off - period " segmental <START:Disease> dystonia <END> .
These results fail to support the notion that <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> are caused by overstimulation of a separate group of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors .
Comparison of developmental toxicology of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> ) in rats using selected dosing paradigms .
BACKGROUND : Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) suggests that a low incidence of <START:Disease> developmental anomalies <END> occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis .
<START:Chemical> Aspirin <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetylsalicylic acid <END> [ <START:Chemical> ASA <END> ] ) , an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor , induces <START:Disease> developmental anomalies <END> when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day ( GD ) 9 , 10 , or 11 ( Kimmel CA , Wilson JG , Schumacher HJ .
Teratology 4 : 15 - 24 , 1971 ) .
There are no published <START:Chemical> ASA <END> studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17 .
Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) and Wistar strains when <START:Chemical> ASA <END> is administered on GD 9 , 10 , or 11 ; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats ; and to test the hypothesis that maternal <START:Disease> gastrointestinal toxicity <END> confounds the detection of low incidence <START:Disease> malformations <END> with <START:Chemical> ASA <END> when a multiple dosing paradigm is used .
METHODS : <START:Chemical> ASA <END> was administered as a single dose on GD 9 ( 0 , 250 , 500 , or 625 mg / kg ) , 10 ( 0 , 500 , 625 , or 750 mg / kg ) , or 11 ( 0 , 500 , 750 , or 1000 mg / kg ) and from GD 6 to GD 17 ( 0 , 50 , 125 , or 250 mg / kg a day ) in the multiple dose study to SD rats .
Animals were killed on GD 21 , and fetuses were examined viscerally .
RESULTS : The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce <START:Disease> ventricular septal defects <END> ( <START:Disease> VSDs <END> ) and <START:Disease> midline defects <END> ( <START:Disease> MDs <END> ) in rats and <START:Disease> diaphragmatic hernia <END> ( <START:Disease> DH <END> ) , <START:Disease> MDs <END> , and <START:Disease> VSDs <END> in rabbits ( Cook JC et al . , 2003 ) ; hence , the present study focused on these <START:Disease> malformations <END> , even though <START:Chemical> ASA <END> induces several other low - incidence <START:Disease> malformations <END> .
In single dose studies , <START:Disease> DH <END> , <START:Disease> MD <END> , and <START:Disease> VSD <END> were induced on GDs 9 and 10 .
<START:Disease> VSD <END> also was noted following treatment on GD 11 .
In contrast , <START:Disease> DH <END> and <START:Disease> MD <END> were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high - dose group , and <START:Disease> VSD <END> was noted across all dose groups .
CONCLUSIONS : High concordance in major <START:Disease> developmental anomalies <END> between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of <START:Disease> VSD <END> in the SD rats and <START:Disease> hydrocephalus <END> in the Wistar rats .
Variations and <START:Disease> malformations <END> were similar when <START:Chemical> ASA <END> was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis ( GDs 6 to 17 ) .
It was also evident that , by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose , <START:Disease> malformations <END> that normally occur at low incidence , as reported from previous single dose studies , could also be induced with <START:Chemical> ASA <END> given at multiple doses .
Extrapyramidal side effects and oral <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> : an analysis of explanatory patient and treatment characteristics .
The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects ( EPS ) was evaluated in 98 patients treated with <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
The incidence of <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> was higher at higher doses of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> and in younger patients .
Prophylactic antiparkinsonian medication was effective in younger but not in older patients .
However , these medications were more effective in both young and old patients when given after <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> developed .
<START:Disease> Akathisia <END> was controlled by the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> <START:Chemical> lorazepam <END> in 14 out of 16 patients , while prophylactic antiparkinsonians were ineffective .
The present study points to patient characteristics that may be of significance in the development of EPS due to <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> .
High dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .
OBJECTIVE : This large - scale retrospective review evaluates the sedation profile of <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> .
AIM : To determine the hemodynamic responses , efficacy and adverse events associated with the use of high dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> as the sole sedative for magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> has been used at our institution since 2005 to provide sedation for pediatric radiological imaging studies .
Over time , an effective protocol utilizing high dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> as the sole sedative agent has evolved .
METHODS / MATERIALS : As part of the ongoing Quality Assurance process , data on all sedations are reviewed monthly and protocols modified as needed .
Data were analyzed from all 747 consecutive patients who received <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> for MRI sedation from April 2005 to April 2007 .
RESULTS : Since 2005 , the 10 - min loading dose of our <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> protocol increased from 2 to 3 microg . kg ( - 1 ) , and the infusion rate increased from 1 to 1 . 5 to 2 microg . kg ( - 1 ) . h ( - 1 ) .
The current sedation protocol progressively increased the rate of successful sedation ( able to complete the imaging study ) when using <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> alone from 91 . 8 % to 97 . 6 % ( P = 0 . 009 ) , reducing the requirement for adjuvant <START:Chemical> pentobarbital <END> in the event of sedation failure with <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> alone and decreased the mean recovery time by 10 min ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
Although <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> sedation was associated with a 16 % incidence of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , all concomitant mean arterial blood pressures were within 20 % of age - adjusted normal range and <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> saturations were 95 % or higher .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> in high doses provides adequate sedation for pediatric MRI studies .
While use of high dose <START:Chemical> dexmedetomidine <END> is associated with decreases in heart rate and blood pressure outside the established ' awake ' norms , this deviation is generally within 20 % of norms , and is not associated with adverse sequelae .
<START:Chemical> Dexmedetomidine <END> is useful as the sole sedative for pediatric MRI .
Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of <START:Chemical> difluoromethylornithine <END> and <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> for prevention of sporadic <START:Disease> colorectal adenomas <END> .
A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of <START:Disease> adenomatous polyps <END> after treatment for 36 months with <START:Chemical> difluoromethylornithine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> ) plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> or matched placebos .
Temporary <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> is a known <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of treatment with <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> , thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms .
The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within - subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies .
Based on 290 subjects , there was an average difference of 0 . 50 dB between subjects treated with <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> compared with those treated with placebo ( 95 % confidence interval , - 0 . 64 to 1 . 63 dB ; P = 0 . 39 ) , adjusted for baseline values , age , and frequencies .
In the normal speech range of 500 to 3 , 000 Hz , an estimated difference of 0 . 99 dB ( - 0 . 17 to 2 . 14 dB ; P = 0 . 09 ) was detected .
Dose intensity did not add information to models .
There were 14 of 151 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> group and 4 of 139 ( 2 . 9 % ) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested ( P = 0 . 02 ) .
Follow - up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1 . 08 dB ( - 0 . 81 to 2 . 96 dB ; P = 0 . 26 ) between treatment arms .
There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> group who experienced clinically significant <START:Disease> hearing loss <END> compared with the placebo group .
The estimated attributable risk of <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> from exposure to the drug is 8 . 4 % ( 95 % confidence interval , - 2 . 0 % to 18 . 8 % ; P = 0 . 12 ) .
There is a < 2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with <START:Chemical> DFMO <END> plus <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> compared with those treated with placebo .
Hepatic <START:Disease> adenomas <END> and <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> of the liver in young women on <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> : case reports .
Two cases of hepatic <START:Disease> adenoma <END> and one of <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> presumably associated with the use of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> , are reported .
Special reference is made to their clinical presentation , which may be totally asymptomatic .
Liver - function tests are of little diagnostic value , but valuable information may be obtained from both liver scanning and hepatic angiography .
Histologic differences and clinical similarities between hepatic <START:Disease> adenoma <END> and <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> of the liver are discussed .
The epidemiology of the acute <START:Disease> flank pain <END> syndrome from <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> .
<START:Chemical> Suprofen <END> , a new nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent .
Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute <START:Disease> flank pain <END> syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system , 700 , 000 persons used the drug in the United States .
Through August 1986 , a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported .
To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome , a case - control study was performed , comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 <START:Chemical> suprofen <END> - exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome .
Case patients were more likely to be men ( odds ratio , 3 . 8 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 2 - 12 . 1 ) , suffer from <START:Disease> hay fever <END> and <START:Disease> asthma <END> ( odds ratio , 3 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 0 - 11 . 9 ) ; to participate in regular exercise ( odds ratio , 5 . 9 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 30 . 7 ) , especially in the use of Nautilus equipment ( p = 0 . 02 ) ; and to use <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> ( odds ratio , 4 . 4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1 . 1 - 17 . 5 ) .
Possible risk factors included young age , concurrent use of other analgesic agents ( especially <START:Chemical> ibuprofen <END> ) , preexisting <START:Disease> renal disease <END> , a history of <START:Disease> kidney stones <END> , a history of <START:Disease> gout <END> , a recent increase in activity , a recent increase in sun exposure , and residence in the Sunbelt .
These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance .
These findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome : acute diffuse crystallization of <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> in renal tubules .
<START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> : a novel selective <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity .
<START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> is a novel selective <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonist .
Oral administration of <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> ( 2 . 5 , 10 . 0 and 30 . 0 mg / kg ) significantly ameliorated the <START:Disease> cataleptic <END> responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> CGS 21680 <END> ( 10 micrograms ) , in a dose - dependent manner .
<START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> also reduced the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ( 1 mg / kg i . p . ) and by <START:Chemical> reserpine <END> ( 5 mg / kg i . p . ) .
These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0 . 625 and 2 . 5 mg / kg p . o . , respectively .
Moreover , <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> ( 0 . 625 mg / kg p . o . ) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of <START:Chemical> L - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylalanine <END> ( <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> ; 25 mg / kg i . p . ) plus <START:Chemical> benserazide <END> ( 6 . 25 mg / kg i . p . ) .
These results suggested that <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> is a centrally active <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by <START:Chemical> adenosine <END> A 2 A receptor antagonists .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> KF 17837 <END> may be a useful drug in the treatment of <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> .
<START:Chemical> Serotonin <END> 6 receptor gene is associated with <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> in a Japanese population .
BACKGROUND : Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for <START:Disease> psychotic disorders <END> such as <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> .
The <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 6 ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics , such as <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> and <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> , and <START:Chemical> d - amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> in rats is corrected with the use of a selective <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 receptor antagonist .
In addition , the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by <START:Chemical> d - amphetamine <END> or <START:Chemical> phencyclidine <END> was restored by <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats .
These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> , and the above evidence suggests that altered <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of <START:Disease> psychotic disorders <END> .
The symptoms of <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> METH <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> are similar to those of <START:Disease> paranoid type schizophrenia <END> .
Therefore , we conducted an analysis of the association of the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> 6 gene ( HTR 6 ) with <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> .
METHOD : Using five tagging SNPs ( rs 6693503 , rs 1805054 , rs 4912138 , rs 3790757 and rs 9659997 ) , we conducted a genetic association analysis of case - control samples ( 197 <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> patients and 337 controls ) in the Japanese population .
The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the <START:Chemical> methamphetamine <END> dependence patients .
RESULTS : rs 6693503 was associated with <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> patients in the allele / genotype - wise analysis .
Moreover , this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction .
In the haplotype - wise analysis , we detected an association between two markers ( rs 6693503 and rs 1805054 ) and three markers ( rs 6693503 , rs 1805054 and rs 4912138 ) in HTR 6 and <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> patients , respectively .
CONCLUSION : HTR 6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of <START:Chemical> METH <END> - induced <START:Disease> psychosis <END> in the Japanese population .
Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> .
Effect of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery .
Injections of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a <START:Disease> depression <END> of the SA nodal activity by a direct action .
This <START:Disease> depression <END> was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase .
Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> , while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta - blocking agent into the SA node artery .
This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> injected in the SA node artery .
Blockade of both D - 1 and D - 2 <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptors may induce <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> in mice .
1 . The <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> antagonists has been tested and the possible <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> subtypes involved in <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> was determined .
2 .
<START:Chemical> Dopamine <END> antagonist <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> , D - 1 antagonist <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> or D - 2 antagonist <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> .
The effect of <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> and <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> was dose - dependent .
Combination of <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> with <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> did not induce <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> potentiation .
3 .
D - 1 agonist <START:Chemical> SKF 38393 <END> or D - 2 agonist <START:Chemical> quinpirole <END> decreased the <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> fluphenazine <END> , <START:Chemical> SCH 23390 <END> or <START:Chemical> sulpiride <END> .

Combination of <START:Chemical> SKF 38393 <END> with <START:Chemical> quinpirole <END> did not cause potentiated inhibitory effect on <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> antagonists .

The data may indicate that although D - 2 receptor blockade is involved in <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> , the D - 1 receptor may plan a role .
Acute <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> after exposure to <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To report a case of acute <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> following exposure to the inhalational anesthetic <START:Chemical> isoflurane <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 70 - year - old healthy woman from Iraq developed acute <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesia .
There was no evidence for viral , autoimmune , or metabolic causes of <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
No other medications were involved except for <START:Chemical> dipyrone <END> for <START:Disease> analgesia <END> .
The <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 1533 U / L and the serum <START:Chemical> bilirubin <END> reached a peak of 17 . 0 mg / dL .
There was slow improvement over 4 months .
Accidental reexposure by the patient to <START:Chemical> dipyrone <END> was uneventful .
DISCUSSION : The clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles <START:Disease> halothane hepatitis <END> , which has a significant mortality rate .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Isoflurane <END> , a common anesthetic agent , can cause severe <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> .
Reversible <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> in a pediatric heart transplant recipient : case report .
<START:Chemical> Tacrolimus <END> is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation .
However , adverse effects include <START:Disease> cardiac toxicity <END> .
Herein we describe transient <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> induced by <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> after heart transplantation .
The <START:Disease> hypertrophy <END> caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography .
Initially , allograft rejection was feared ; however , myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial <START:Disease> edema <END> and mild <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> ; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected .
The blood <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> concentration was higher than usual at that time ; thus , <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> dosage was reduced .
<START:Disease> Myocardial hypertrophy <END> completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> and did not recur , as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy .
Thus , we conclude that <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> induces reversible <START:Disease> myocardial hypertrophy <END> .
In patients receiving <START:Chemical> tacrolimus <END> therapy , blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement .
Effect of intravenous <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> or intravenous <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> plus glucagon on <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
STUDY OBJECTIVE : To determine the effect of <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> on <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress testing with <START:Chemical> technetium - 99 m sestamibi <END> single - photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST - segment monitoring , and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> ' s effects .
DESIGN : Randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
SETTING : Community hospital .
PATIENTS : Twenty - two patients with known reversible perfusion defects .
INTERVENTION : Patients underwent <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress tests per standard protocol .
Before <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> was begun , no therapy was given during the first visit , and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> or <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> plus glucagon 1 mg . <START:Chemical> Metoprolol <END> was dosed to achieve a resting <START:Chemical> predobutamine <END> heart rate below 65 beats / minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : <START:Chemical> Metoprolol <END> reduced maximum heart rate 31 % , summed stress scores 29 % , and summed difference scores 43 % versus control .
<START:Chemical> Metoprolol <END> plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29 % versus control .
Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced , although they were 18 % and 30 % lower , respectively , than control .
No significant differences were found in any parameter between <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> and <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> - glucagon .
CONCLUSION : During <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> stress testing , <START:Chemical> metoprolol <END> attenuates or eliminates evidence of <START:Disease> myocardial ischemia <END> .
Glucagon 1 mg , although somewhat effective , does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically .
Apparent cure of <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> by bone marrow transplantation .
We describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RA <END> ) by bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) in 2 patients .
BMT was used to treat severe <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> which was caused by <START:Chemical> gold <END> in one case and <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> in the other .
In the 8 and 6 years since the transplants ( representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy , respectively ) , the <START:Disease> RA <END> in each case has been completely quiescent .
Although short term remission of severe <START:Disease> RA <END> following BMT has been reported , these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been available .
This experience raises the question of the role of BMT itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive <START:Disease> synovitis <END> .
Rat extraocular muscle regeneration .
Repair of local anesthetic - induced damage .
Local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery ( 0 . 75 % <START:Chemical> bupivacaine hydrochloride <END> , 2 . 0 % <START:Chemical> mepivacaine hydrochloride <END> , and 2 . 0 % <START:Chemical> lidocaine hydrochloride <END> plus 1 : 100 , 000 <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> ) were injected into the retrobulbar area of rat eyes .
Controls were injected with physiological saline .
All three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular muscles .
<START:Disease> Muscle degeneration <END> is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fibers .
In addition to <START:Disease> muscle damage <END> , severe damage was also seen in harderian glands , especially after exposure to <START:Chemical> mepivacaine <END> and <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> plus <START:Chemical> epinephrine <END> .
With these findings in rats , it is hypothesized that the temporary <START:Disease> diplopia <END> sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic - induced damage to the extraocular muscles .
<START:Disease> Tricuspid valve regurgitation <END> and <START:Chemical> lithium carbonate <END> <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in a newborn infant .
A newborn with massive <START:Disease> tricuspid regurgitation <END> , <START:Disease> atrial flutter <END> , <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> , and a high serum <START:Chemical> lithium <END> level is described .
This is the first patient to initially manifest <START:Disease> tricuspid regurgitation <END> and <START:Disease> atrial flutter <END> , and the 11 th described patient with <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> among infants exposed to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> compounds in the first trimester of pregnancy .
Sixty - three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve involvement .
<START:Chemical> Lithium carbonate <END> may be a factor in the increasing incidence of <START:Disease> congenital heart disease <END> when taken during early pregnancy .
It also causes <START:Disease> neurologic depression <END> , <START:Disease> cyanosis <END> , and <START:Disease> cardiac arrhythmia <END> when consumed prior to delivery .
Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> : correlation with <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 single - photon emission tomography .
It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to <START:Disease> coronary occlusion <END> and to critical <START:Disease> coronary stenoses <END> in the presence of <START:Disease> hyperemic <END> stimulation .
The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> .
The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual - perfusion technique and with <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 single - photon emission tomography ( SPECT ) .
During a transient ( 20 - s ) <START:Disease> coronary occlusion <END> , a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced .
The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 74 ; p less than 0 . 002 ) .
During <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> , 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography .
The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild ( 0 % to 50 % ) reduction in <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> .
The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 61 ; p = 0 . 02 ) .
<START:Chemical> Thallium <END> - 201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during <START:Chemical> dipyridamole <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperemia <END> ; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography ( r = 0 . 58 ; p less than 0 . 03 ) .
Thus , myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of <START:Disease> coronary stenosis <END> .
The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with <START:Chemical> thallium <END> - 201 SPECT .
Effects of the cyclooxygenase - 2 specific inhibitor <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events in patients with <START:Disease> arthritis <END> .
There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events may be higher with cyclooxygenase ( COX ) - 2 - specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
We evaluated cardiovascular event data for <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> , a new COX - 2 - specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials .
The incidence of cardiovascular <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events ( cardiac , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular , or arterial <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> ) was determined by analyzing pooled <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> ( 10 - 80 mg daily ) , nonselective NSAID ( <START:Chemical> diclofenac <END> 75 mg bid , <START:Chemical> ibuprofen <END> 800 mg tid , or <START:Chemical> naproxen <END> 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> trials that were 6 - 52 weeks in duration .
The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients ( n = 7934 ) and in users of low - dose ( < or = 325 mg daily ) <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( n = 1051 ) and nonusers of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( n = 6883 ) .
Crude and exposure - adjusted incidences of <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events were similar for <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> , NSAIDs , and placebo .
The risk of serious <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events was also similar for each <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> dose .
<START:Disease> Thrombotic <END> risk was consistently higher for users of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> users than nonusers of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ( placebo , 1 . 4 % vs . 0 % ; <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> , 1 . 7 % vs . 0 . 2 % ; NSAIDs , 1 . 9 % vs . 0 . 5 % ) .
The rates of events in users of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> doses .
Short - and intermediate - term treatment with therapeutic ( 10 or 20 mg daily ) and supratherapeutic ( 40 or 80 mg daily ) <START:Chemical> valdecoxib <END> doses was not associated with an increased incidence of <START:Disease> thrombotic <END> events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in <START:Disease> osteoarthritis <END> and <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> patients in controlled clinical trials .
Postpartum <START:Disease> psychosis <END> induced by <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> .
Two multigravida patients with no prior <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> history were seen with postpartum <START:Disease> psychosis <END> , having received <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> for <START:Disease> inhibition of lactation <END> .
<START:Chemical> Bromocriptine <END> given in high doses has been associated with <START:Disease> psychosis <END> in patients receiving the drug for <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
These cases demonstrate that <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> may cause <START:Disease> psychosis <END> even when given in low doses .
Calcitonin gene - related peptide levels during <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> - induced <START:Disease> headache <END> in patients with chronic <START:Disease> tension - type headache <END> .
It has been proposed that <START:Chemical> nitric oxide <END> ( <START:Chemical> NO <END> ) induced <START:Disease> headache <END> in <START:Disease> primary headaches <END> may be associated with release of calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) .
In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during <START:Disease> headache <END> induced by the <START:Chemical> NO <END> donor <START:Chemical> glyceryl trinitrate <END> ( <START:Chemical> GTN <END> ) in 16 patients with chronic <START:Disease> tension - type headache <END> and 16 healthy controls .
The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0 . 5 microg / kg / min <START:Chemical> GTN <END> or placebo over 20 min on two <START:Disease> headache <END> - free days .
Blood samples were collected at baseline , 10 , 20 and 60 min after start of infusion .
Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate <START:Disease> headache <END> on the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> day than on the placebo day and the <START:Disease> headache <END> was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls .
There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve ( AUCCGRP ) on <START:Chemical> GTN <END> vs . placebo day in either patients ( P = 0 . 65 ) or controls ( P = 0 . 48 ) .
The AUCCGRP recorded on the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> day did not differ between patients and controls ( P = 0 . 36 ) .
Both in patients and controls , CGRP levels changed significantly over time , on both the <START:Chemical> GTN <END> and placebo days ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
The present study indicates that <START:Chemical> NO <END> - induced immediate <START:Disease> headache <END> is not associated with release of CGRP .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced oromandibular <START:Disease> dystonia <END> in <START:Disease> progressive supranuclear palsy <END> .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> have been reported in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> and <START:Disease> multiple system atrophy <END> .
Cranial <START:Disease> dystonias <END> are rare in patients with <START:Disease> progressive supranuclear palsy <END> ( <START:Disease> PSP <END> ) .
In this report we describe an unusual case of reversible <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> Oromandibular dystonia <END> ( <START:Disease> OMD <END> ) in a <START:Disease> PSP <END> patient to highlight the importance of recognizing this drug related complication in the management of <START:Disease> PSP <END> , and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiology .
Contribution of <START:Chemical> sodium valproate <END> to the <START:Disease> syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone <END> .
We report the case of a 62 - year - old man who was administered <START:Chemical> sodium valproate <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) and who subsequently developed the <START:Disease> syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone <END> ( <START:Disease> SIADH <END> ) .
He had been taking <START:Chemical> VPA <END> for treatment of idiopathic generalized <START:Disease> tonic - clonic convulsions <END> since he was 56 years old .
After substituting <START:Chemical> VPA <END> with <START:Chemical> zonisamide <END> , the serum <START:Chemical> sodium <END> level returned to normal .
We consider this episode of <START:Disease> SIADH <END> to be the result of a combination of factors including a <START:Disease> weakness of the central nervous system <END> and the long - term administration of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> .
Potential deleterious effect of <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> in radiocontrast <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
18 patients , referred to a radiocontrast study , considered at risk because of preexisting <START:Disease> renal insufficiency <END> , were enrolled in a prospective , randomized , controlled trial , performed at the secondary care center of a 1 , 100 - bed private university hospital .
In addition to fluids , the treatment group received <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> ( mean dose 110 mg ) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material .
The control group received fluids ( mean 3 liters ) .
Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non - ionic contrast material , at an average dose of 245 ml .
<START:Disease> Renal function significantly deteriorated <END> in the group pretreated with <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> ( p < 0 . 005 by ANOVA ) , with a rise in serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> from 145 + / - 13 to 182 + / - 16 mumol / l at 24 h , while no change occurred in the control group ( from 141 + / - 6 to 142 + / - 7 mumol / l ) .
<START:Disease> Renal failure <END> was associated with <START:Disease> weight loss <END> in the <START:Chemical> furosemide <END> - treated group .
<START:Chemical> Furosemide <END> may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast <START:Disease> nephropathy <END> .
<START:Disease> Stroke <END> and <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use .
The association of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> use with hemorrhagic and <START:Disease> ischemic <END> <START:Disease> stroke <END> is based almost solely on data from case series .
The limited number of epidemiologic studies of <START:Disease> stroke <END> and use of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> have been done in settings that serve mostly the poor and / or minorities .
This case - control study was conducted in the defined population comprising members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern and Southern California .
We attempted to identify all incident <START:Disease> strokes <END> in women ages 15 - 44 years during a 3 - year period using hospital admission and discharge records , emergency department logs , and payment requests for out - of - plan hospitalizations .
We selected controls , matched on age and facility of usual care , at random from healthy members of the health plan .
We obtained information in face - to - face interviews .
There were 347 confirmed <START:Disease> stroke <END> cases and 1 , 021 controls .
The univariate matched odds ratio for <START:Disease> stroke <END> in women who admitted to using <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> was 8 . 5 ( 95 % confidence interval = 3 . 6 - 20 . 0 ) .
After further adjustment for potential confounders , the odds ratio in women who reported using <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> was 7 . 0 ( 95 % confidence interval = 2 . 8 - 17 . 9 ) .
The use of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> and / or <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> is a strong risk factor for <START:Disease> stroke <END> in this socioeconomically heterogeneous , insured urban population .
Recurrent <START:Disease> dysosmia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> .
<START:Chemical> Pyrazinamide <END> can have adverse effects such as <START:Disease> hepatic toxicity <END> , <START:Disease> hyperuricemia <END> or digestive disorders .
In rare cases , alterations in taste and smell function have been reported for <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> when combined with other drugs .
We report a case of reversible <START:Disease> olfactory disorder <END> related to <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> in a woman , with a positive rechallenge .
The patient presented every day a sensation of smelling something burning 15 min after drug intake .
<START:Disease> Dysosmia <END> disappeared completely after <START:Chemical> pyrazinamide <END> withdrawal and recurred after its rechallenge .
The case was reported to the Tunisian Centre of Pharmacovigilance .
Efficacy and tolerability of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> in 3390 women with moderate <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> in women with moderate <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> .
DESIGN : The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of <START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> ( EXCEL ) Study , a multicenter , double - blind , diet - and placebo - controlled trial , in which participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo or <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> at doses of 20 or 40 mg once daily , or 20 or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks .
SETTING : Ambulatory patients recruited by 362 participating centers throughout the United States .
PATIENTS : Women ( n = 3390 ) from the total cohort of 8245 volunteers .
MEASUREMENTS : Plasma total , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , and high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> , and <START:Chemical> triglycerides <END> ; and laboratory and clinical evidence of adverse events monitored periodically throughout the study .
RESULTS : Among women , <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> ( 20 to 80 mg / d ) produced sustained ( 12 - to 48 - week ) , dose - related changes ( P < 0 . 001 ) : decreases in LDL <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> ( 24 % to 40 % ) and <START:Chemical> triglycerides <END> ( 9 % to 18 % ) , and increases in HDL <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> ( 6 . 7 % to 8 . 6 % ) .
Depending on the dose , from 82 % to 95 % of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> - treated women achieved the National <START:Chemical> Cholesterol <END> Education Program goal of LDL <START:Chemical> cholesterol <END> levels less than 4 . 14 mmol / L ( 160 mg / dL ) , and 40 % to 87 % achieved the goal of 3 . 36 mmol / L ( 130 mg / dL ) .
Successive transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 0 . 1 % of women and were dose dependent above the 20 - mg dose .
<START:Disease> Myopathy <END> , defined as muscle symptoms with <START:Chemical> creatine <END> kinase elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal , was rare and associated with the highest recommended daily dose of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> ( 80 mg ) .
Estrogen - replacement therapy appeared to have no effect on either the efficacy or safety profile of <START:Chemical> lovastatin <END> .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Lovastatin <END> is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary <START:Disease> hypercholesterolemia <END> in women .
Potential therapeutic use of the selective <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 1 receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> : an acute study in <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - primed monkeys .
The clinical utility of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> DA <END> ) D 1 receptor agonists in the treatment of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> ( <START:Disease> PD <END> ) is still unclear .
The therapeutic use of selective <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 receptor agonists such as <START:Chemical> SKF - 82958 <END> ( <START:Chemical> 6 - chloro - 7 , 8 - dihydroxy - 3 - allyl - 1 - phenyl - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrahydro - 1 H - 3 - benzaze pine hydrobromide <END> ) and <START:Chemical> A - 77636 <END> ( <START:Chemical> [ 1 R , 3 S ] 3 - [ 1 ' - admantyl ] - 1 - aminomethyl - 3 , 4 - dihydro - 5 , 6 - dihydroxy - 1 H - 2 - benzo pyran hydrochloride <END> ) seems limited because of their duration of action , which is too short for <START:Chemical> SKF - 82958 <END> ( < 1 hr ) and too long for <START:Chemical> A - 77636 <END> ( > 20 hr , leading to behavioral tolerance ) .
We therefore conducted the present acute dose - response study in four <START:Chemical> 1 - methyl - 4 - phenyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 - tetrahydropyridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> ) - exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> to evaluate the locomotor and <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> effects on challenge with four doses ( from 0 . 03 to 1 . 0 mg / kg ) of <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> ( <START:Chemical> [ - ] - [ 5 aR , 11 bS ] - 4 , 5 , 5 a , 6 , 7 , 11 b - hexahydro - 2 - propyl - 3 - thia - 5 - + ++ azacyclopent - 1 - ena [ c ] phenathrene - 9 - 10 - diol <END> ) , a selective and full <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 - like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action .
<START:Chemical> Levodopa <END> and the <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 2 - like receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> LY - 171555 <END> ( <START:Chemical> [ 4 aR - trans ] - 4 , 4 a , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 8 a , 9 - o - dihydro - 5 n - propyl - 2 H - pyrazo lo - 3 - 4 - quinoline hydrochloride <END> ) were also used for comparison .
Acute administration of <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> was as efficacious in alleviating <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - induced <START:Disease> parkinsonism <END> as <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and <START:Chemical> LY - 171555 <END> , but was less likely to reproduce the <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in these animals than with either <START:Chemical> LY - 171555 <END> or subsequent challenge of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> .
Selective stimulation of the <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus ( referred to as the basal ganglia output ) compared with <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> and selective <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 2 receptor agonist .
Potent <START:Chemical> DA <END> D 1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as <START:Chemical> A - 86929 <END> ( approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested ) are potential therapeutic tools in <START:Disease> PD <END> and merit further attention .
Experimental cranial <START:Disease> pain <END> elicited by <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> : a PET study .
Using a positron emission tomography ( PET ) study it was shown recently that in <START:Disease> migraine <END> without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the <START:Disease> headache <END> state , but not in the <START:Disease> headache <END> free interval .
It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the <START:Disease> migraine <END> attack itself and represents the so called ' <START:Disease> migraine <END> generator ' .
To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental <START:Disease> pain <END> study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the <START:Disease> migraine <END> patients .
A small amount of <START:Chemical> capsaicin <END> was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning <START:Disease> painful <END> sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve .
Increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) were found bilaterally in the insula , in the anterior cingulate cortex , the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum .
Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned <START:Disease> migraine <END> study no brain stem activation was found in the acute <START:Disease> pain <END> state compared to the <START:Disease> pain <END> free state .
The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however , suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted <START:Disease> pain <END> as such , rather than in a specific type of <START:Disease> headache <END> as was suggested for <START:Disease> cluster headache <END> .
Prenatal exposure to <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> induces <START:Disease> fetal pulmonary hypertension <END> in the rat .
RATIONALE : <START:Chemical> Fluoxetine <END> is a selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women .
Epidemiological data suggest that <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension syndrome <END> of the newborn .
The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical , considering the current evidence of a <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension <END> protective <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> effect in adult rodents .
OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> effect on fetal rat pulmonary vascular smooth muscle mechanical properties and cell proliferation rate .
METHODS : Pregnant rats were treated with <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> ( 10 mg / kg ) from Day 11 through Day 21 of gestation .
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Fetuses were delivered by cesarean section .
As compared with controls , <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> exposure resulted in <START:Disease> fetal pulmonary hypertension <END> as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum ( P = 0 . 02 ) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
Postnatal mortality was increased among experimental animals , and arterial <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> saturation was 96 + / - 1 % in 1 - day - old control animals and significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) in <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> - exposed pups ( 79 + / - 2 % ) .
In vitro , <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal , but not adult , animals ( P < 0 . 01 ) and reduced <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> - induced contraction at both ages ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
After in utero exposure to a low <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> concentration the pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation rate was significantly increased in fetal , but not adult , cells ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In contrast to the adult , <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> exposure in utero induces <START:Disease> pulmonary hypertension <END> in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation .
Effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with <START:Disease> aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> .
Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) with prominent anti - inflammatory properties .
Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate .
Patients with <START:Disease> aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage <END> ( <START:Disease> SAH <END> ) were randomized to receive either <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> , 100 mg , three times a day ( <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> group , n = 9 ) or a weak NSAID , <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> , 1 g , three times a day ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> group , n = 9 ) starting immediately after the diagnosis of <START:Disease> aneurysmal <END> <START:Disease> SAH <END> .
Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively .
Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first , third , and fifth postoperative mornings .
Maximal <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> induced by 6 microM of <START:Chemical> adenosine diphosphate <END> decreased after administration of <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> .
Aggregation was lower ( P < . 05 ) in the <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> group than in the <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day .
In contrast , maximal <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> increased in the <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> results ( P < . 05 ) .
One patient in the <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> group developed a postoperative intracranial <START:Disease> hematoma <END> .
Coagulation ( prothrombin time [ PT ] , activated partial thromboplastin time [ APPT ] , fibrinogen concentration , and antithrombin III [ AT III ] ) was comparable between the two groups .
<START:Chemical> Ketoprofen <END> but not <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> impaired platelet function in patients with <START:Disease> SAH <END> .
If <START:Chemical> ketoprofen <END> is used before surgery on cerebral <START:Disease> artery aneurysms <END> , it may pose an additional risk factor for <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> .
<START:Disease> Erectile dysfunction <END> occurs following substantia nigra lesions in the rat .
Erectile function was assessed 6 weeks following uni - and bilateral injections of <START:Chemical> 6 - hydroxydopamine <END> in the substantia nigra nucleus of the brain .
Behavioral <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced penile erections were reduced ( 5 / 8 ) and increased ( 3 / 8 ) in uni - and bilateral lesioned animals .
Intracavernous pressures , following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve , decreased in lesioned animals .
Lesions of the substantia nigra were confirmed by histology .
Concentration of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> and its metabolites were decreased in the striatum of substantia nigra lesioned rats .
Lesions of the substantia nigra are therefore associated with <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> in rats and may serve as a model to study <START:Disease> erectile dysfunction <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
<START:Disease> Neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> is thought to be a result of <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> D 2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia .
<START:Chemical> Risperidone <END> , a <START:Chemical> benzisoxazole <END> derivative antipsychotic , has high <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> 5 - HT 2 receptor blockade and dose - related D 2 receptor blockade .
The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> at low dosages .
With this low frequency of <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> , it was thought the frequency of <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> might also be lowered .
A 73 - year - old woman developed <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> after monotherapy with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> .
The syndrome reversed after discontinuing <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and starting treatment with <START:Chemical> dantrolene <END> and <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> .
It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> does not ensure protection from <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate <END> - induced fulminant <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> in a pregnant woman .
A case report .
We report the case of a 19 - year - old Laotian patient affected by fulminant <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> during the third trimester of her pregnancy after a 1 - month administration of <START:Chemical> quinidine phenylethylbarbiturate <END> .
After delivery , the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation .
The patient was in good condition 16 months after liver transplantation .
<START:Chemical> Quinidine <END> itself or <START:Chemical> phenylethylbarbiturate <END> may be responsible for fulminant <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> in this patient .
<START:Chemical> Low - molecular - weight heparin <END> for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves .
BACKGROUND : The interruption of oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non - surgical interventions , and pregnancy .
<START:Chemical> Unfractionated heparin <END> ( <START:Chemical> UH <END> ) is currently the substitute for selected patients .
<START:Chemical> Low - molecular - weight heparin <END> ( <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> ) offers theoretical advantages over <START:Chemical> UH <END> , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to <START:Chemical> UH <END> in patients with prosthetic valves .
HYPOTHESIS : The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice .
METHODS : For this paper , the current medical literature on <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed .
RESULTS : There were eight series and six case reports .
None of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospective .
Data to establish the <START:Disease> thromboembolic <END> risk were incomplete .
After excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short - term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b ) short - term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / periprocedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long - term , due to intolerance to OAC ( n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long - term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) .
The incidence rate of <START:Disease> thromboembolism <END> was 0 . 9 % for all the studies and 0 . 5 , 0 , 20 , and 0 % in groups a , b , c , and d , respectively ; for <START:Disease> hemorrhage <END> , the overall rate was 3 . 4 % ( 3 . 8 , 2 . 6 , 10 , and 0 % for the respective groups ) .
CONCLUSIONS : In patients with mechanical heart valves , short - term <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> therapy compares favorably with <START:Chemical> UH <END> .
Data on mid - and long - term <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> administration in these patients are sparse .
Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of <START:Chemical> LMWH <END> in patients with mechanical heart valves .
<START:Disease> Peripheral neuropathy <END> caused by high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> treatment in a patient with <START:Disease> acute myeloid leukemia <END> .
The central nervous system <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> is well recognized , but the <START:Disease> toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported .
A 49 - year - old Japanese man was diagnosed with <START:Disease> acute myeloid leukemia <END> .
After he achieved complete remission , he received high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> treatment ( 2 g / m 2 twice a day for 5 days ; total , 20 g / m 2 ) as consolidation therapy .
The first course of high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> resulted in no unusual symptoms , but on day 21 of the second course of treatment , the patient complained of <START:Disease> numbness <END> in his right foot .
Electromyogram and nerve - conduction studies showed <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> in both peroneal nerves .
This <START:Disease> neuropathy <END> was gradually resolving ; however , after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , the symptoms worsened , with the development of <START:Disease> graft - versus - host disease <END> , and the symptoms subsequently responded to <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> .
Although the mechanisms of <START:Disease> peripheral neuropathy <END> are still unclear , high - dose <START:Chemical> cytosine arabinoside <END> is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system , and auto / alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms .
<START:Chemical> Sorafenib <END> - induced acute <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> due to <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> .
A 65 - year - old man with advanced <START:Disease> renal cell carcinoma <END> was admitted due to continuing <START:Disease> chest pain <END> at rest .
Two weeks before his admission , <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> had been started .
He was diagnosed with non - ST - elevation <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> by laboratory data and electrocardiogram .
Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed <START:Disease> subendocardial infarction <END> .
However , there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography .
<START:Disease> Coronary artery spasm <END> was induced by a provocative test .
Cessation of <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> and administration of <START:Chemical> Ca <END> - channel blocker and <START:Chemical> nitrates <END> ameliorated his symptoms , but relapse occurred after resumption of <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> .
Addition of oral <START:Chemical> nicorandil <END> reduced his symptoms and maintained <START:Disease> stable angina <END> status .
We report the first case of <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> - induced <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sorafenib <END> is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival .
On the other hand , the Rho / ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> coronary artery spasm <END> .
Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho / ROCK pathway by <START:Chemical> sorafenib <END> use .
Massive <START:Disease> cerebral edema <END> associated with fulminant <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> in <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> <START:Disease> overdose <END> : possible role of cranial decompression .
<START:Disease> Cerebral edema <END> may complicate the course of <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> .
Response to conventional therapy has been disappointing .
We present a patient with fatal <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> - induced <START:Disease> fulminant hepatic failure <END> , with signs and symptoms of <START:Disease> cerebral edema <END> , unresponsive to conventional medical therapy .
Cranial decompression was carried out .
A justification of the need for further evaluation of cranial decompression in such patients is presented .
Risk for <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> among users of <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> and <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> who underwent echocardiography before use of medication .
BACKGROUND : Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30 % to 38 % of users of <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> and <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> had <START:Disease> valvular disease <END> , these drugs were withdrawn from the market .
OBJECTIVE : To determine the risk for new or worsening <START:Disease> valvular abnormalities <END> among users of <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> or <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications .
DESIGN : Cohort study .
SETTING : Academic primary care practices .
PATIENTS : 46 patients who used <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> or <START:Chemical> dexfenfluramine <END> for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy .
MEASUREMENTS : Follow - up echocardiography .
The primary outcome was new or worsening <START:Disease> valvulopathy <END> , defined as progression of either <START:Disease> aortic or mitral regurgitation <END> by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U . S . Food and Drug Administration criteria ( at least mild <START:Disease> aortic regurgitation <END> or moderate <START:Disease> mitral regurgitation <END> ) .
RESULTS : Two patients ( 4 . 3 % [ 95 % CI , 0 . 6 % to 14 . 8 % ] ) receiving <START:Chemical> fenfluramine <END> - <START:Chemical> phentermine <END> developed <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> .
One had baseline <START:Disease> bicuspid aortic valve <END> and mild <START:Disease> aortic regurgitation <END> that progressed to moderate regurgitation .
The second patient developed new moderate <START:Disease> aortic insufficiency <END> .
CONCLUSION : Users of diet medications are at risk for <START:Disease> valvular heart disease <END> .
However , the incidence may be lower than that reported previously .
A case of <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> .
Although <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> has been used for many <START:Disease> rheumatologic diseases <END> , <START:Disease> toxicity <END> limits its usefulness in many patients .
<START:Disease> Polymyositis <END> / <START:Disease> dermatomyositis <END> can develop as one of the autoimmune complications of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> treatment , but its exact pathogenesis remains unclear .
We report a patient with <START:Disease> primary biliary cirrhosis <END> , who developed <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> while receiving <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> therapy .
We described the special clinical course of the patient .
Patients receiving <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> therapy should be followed carefully for the development of autoimmune complications like <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> / <START:Disease> dermatomyositis <END> .
Swallowing - induced <START:Disease> atrial tachyarrhythmia <END> triggered by <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> : case report and review of the literature .
CASE : A 49 - year - old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing .
On electrocardiogram , episodes of <START:Disease> atrial tachyarrhythmia <END> were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 - hour Holter monitoring recorded several events .
The <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> resolved after therapy with <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> , but recurred a year later .
The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> .
After stopping the beta - agonist , and after a week with the <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> , the <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> disappeared .
DISCUSSION : Swallowing - induced <START:Disease> atrial tachyarrhythmia <END> ( <START:Disease> SIAT <END> ) is a rare phenomenon .
Fewer than 50 cases of <START:Disease> SIAT <END> have been described in the literature .
This article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to <START:Disease> SIAT <END> .
It discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of <START:Disease> arrhythmia <END> , postulated mechanisms of <START:Disease> SIAT <END> , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) .
CONCLUSION : <START:Chemical> Salbutamol <END> is presented here as a possible trigger for <START:Disease> SIAT <END> .
Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta - agonist like <START:Chemical> salbutamol <END> ( known to induce <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta - blocker such as <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it .
Impact of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures .
BACKGROUND : More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith ( 1973 ) reported on the devastation caused by <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> exposure on fetal development , the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged .
Early identification of fetal <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes .
This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - related fetal <START:Disease> growth impairment <END> .
METHODS : We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> intervention study .
The fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregnancies .
Because intensity of <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of > or = 5 drinks per drinking day ) <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumers .
Fetal measures from the heavy - exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a nondrinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinics .
Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and <START:Disease> drug abuse <END> .
RESULTS : Nearly half of the pregnant drinkers abstained after learning of their pregnancies .
When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non - <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> - exposed group , regardless of prior drinking patterns .
Any <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in <START:Disease> reduced cerebellar growth <END> as well as <START:Disease> decreased cranial to body growth <END> in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers .
<START:Chemical> Amphetamine <END> abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth ratios .
CONCLUSIONS : Alterations in fetal biometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancies .
Although the reliance on self - reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal <START:Chemical> alcohol <END> effects .
<START:Disease> Seizure <END> activity with <START:Chemical> imipenem <END> therapy : incidence and risk factors .
Two elderly patients with a history of either <START:Disease> cerebral vascular accident <END> ( <START:Disease> CVA <END> ) or <START:Disease> head trauma <END> and no evidence of <START:Disease> renal disease <END> developed <START:Disease> seizures <END> while receiving maximum doses of <START:Chemical> imipenem / cilastatin <END> .
Neither patient had reported previous <START:Disease> seizures <END> or <START:Disease> seizure <END> - like activity nor was receiving anticonvulsant agents .
All <START:Disease> seizures <END> were controlled with therapeutic doses of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> .
Both patients had received maximum doses of other <START:Chemical> beta - lactam <END> antibiotics without evidence of <START:Disease> seizure <END> activity .
Etiologic factors in the pathogenesis of <START:Disease> liver tumors <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oral contraceptives <END> .
Within the last several years , previously rare <START:Disease> liver tumors <END> have been seen in young women using <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
The Registry for <START:Disease> Liver Tumors <END> Associated with <START:Chemical> Oral Contraceptives <END> at the University of California , Irvine , has clearly identified 27 cases .
The recent literature contains 44 case reports .
Common to these 71 cases has been a histopathologic diagnosis of <START:Disease> focal nodular hyperplasia <END> , <START:Disease> adenoma <END> , <START:Disease> hamartoma <END> , and <START:Disease> hepatoma <END> .
Significant statistical etiologic factors include prolonged uninterrupted usage of <START:Chemical> oral contraceptive <END> <START:Chemical> steroids <END> .
Eight deaths and liver <START:Disease> rupture <END> in 18 patients attest to the seriousness of this new potentially lethal adverse phenomenon .
Subjective assessment of <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> of patients on long - term administration of <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> .
Various data suggest that male patients who have received <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum <START:Chemical> estrogen <END> and decreased levels of plasma <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) .
This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long - term administration of <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> therapy and sexual behavior , and the effect of <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> on plasma levels of <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> , <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> , and LH .
The patients of the study and control group ( without <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> ) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age ( 25 - 40 years ) and were randomly selected from the <START:Disease> rheumatic heart disease <END> patients .
A subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out , using parameters such as sexual desire , sexual excitement , and frequency of sexual relations .
Personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavior .
The findings support the reports concerning <START:Chemical> digoxin <END> effect on plasma <START:Chemical> estradiol <END> , <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> , and LH .
The differences in the means were significant .
Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant <START:Disease> decrease in sexual desire <END> , sexual excitement phase ( erection ) , and frequency of sexual relations in the study group .
Complete <START:Disease> atrioventricular block <END> secondary to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
<START:Disease> Sinus node dysfunction <END> has been reported most frequently among the adverse cardiovascular effects of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> .
In the present case , complete <START:Disease> atrioventricular ( AV ) block <END> with <START:Disease> syncopal attacks <END> developed secondary to <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy , necessitating permanent pacemaker implantation .
Serum <START:Chemical> lithium <END> levels remained under or within the therapeutic range during the <START:Disease> syncopal attacks <END> .
<START:Chemical> Lithium <END> should be used with extreme caution , especially in patients with mild disturbance of AV conduction .
A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> therapy .
A prospective evaluation of the efficacy and safety of <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> was conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16 - month period .
<START:Chemical> Vancomycin <END> was curative in 95 % of 43 patients with proven <START:Disease> infection <END> .
Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions ; in three of these <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> was considered the likely cause .
Reactions included <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> ( 20 of 54 patients ) , <START:Disease> rash <END> ( 4 of 54 ) , <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> ( 4 of 50 ) , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> ( 1 of 50 ) and <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> ( 1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry ) .
<START:Disease> Thrombophlebitis <END> occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae ; <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> and <START:Disease> ototoxicity <END> were confined to patients receiving an <START:Chemical> aminoglycoside <END> plus <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> .
We conclude that <START:Chemical> vancomycin <END> , administered appropriately , constitutes safe , effective therapy for <START:Disease> infections <END> caused by susceptible bacteria .
<START:Disease> Hepatic veno - occlusive disease <END> caused by <START:Chemical> 6 - thioguanine <END> .
Clinically reversible <START:Disease> veno - occlusive disease of the liver <END> developed in a 23 - year - old man with <START:Disease> acute lymphocytic leukemia <END> after 10 months of maintenance therapy with <START:Chemical> 6 - thioguanine <END> .
Serial liver biopsies showed the development and resolution of intense sinusoidal engorgement .
Although this disease was clinically reversible , some subintimal <START:Disease> fibrosis <END> about the terminal hepatic veins persisted .
This case presented a unique opportunity to observe the histologic features of clinically reversible <START:Disease> hepatic veno - occlusive disease <END> over time , and may be the first case of veno - occlusive related solely to <START:Chemical> 6 - thioguanine <END> .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> after liver transplantation .
BACKGROUND : <START:Chemical> Unfractionated heparin sodium <END> ( <START:Chemical> UFH <END> ) or <START:Chemical> low - molecular weight heparin <END> ( LMWH ) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> after liver transplantation .
<START:Chemical> Heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> ( <START:Disease> HIT <END> ) is an adverse immune - mediated reaction to <START:Chemical> heparin <END> , resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50 % .
The frequencies of <START:Disease> HIT <END> after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4 / <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - reactive antibody ( <START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody ) positivity in liver transplantation patients , however , are unknown .
PATIENTS AND METHODS : The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation .
We started LMWH ( 25 IU / kg / h ) on postoperative day ( POD ) 1 , switching to <START:Chemical> UFH <END> ( 5000 U / d ) on POD 2 or 3 .
The dose of <START:Chemical> UFH <END> was changed according to the activated clotting time level .
<START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14 .
Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks .
RESULTS : The average platelet counts preoperatively , and on POD 7 , 14 , and 21 were 65 , 88 , 149 , and 169 x 10 ( 9 ) / L , respectively .
Two patients developed hepatic artery <START:Disease> thrombosis <END> on POD 11 and 19 , respectively , although they were <START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody - negative and their platelet counts were stable .
In 2 other patients , the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9 ) / L on POD 9 , respectively .
The <START:Chemical> heparin <END> - induced <START:Disease> platelet aggregation <END> test was negative in these patients .
The percentage of <START:Disease> HIT <END> antibody - positive patients was 0 . 5 % preoperatively , 5 . 6 % on POD 7 , and 5 . 6 % on POD 14 .
None of the subjects / patients developed <START:Chemical> UFH <END> - related <START:Disease> HIT <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : In our series , the occurrence of <START:Disease> HIT <END> after liver transplantation was uncommon .
<START:Disease> Hypersensitivity <END> <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> complicating <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> heart .
The present report describes a case of <START:Disease> eosinophilic myocarditis <END> complicating <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> .
The 47 - year - old female patient , known to have <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , was admitted with <START:Disease> biventricular failure <END> and managed aggressively with <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion and other drugs while being assessed for heart transplantation .
On transthoracic echocardiogram , she had moderate <START:Disease> left ventricular dysfunction <END> with regional variability and moderate <START:Disease> mitral regurgitation <END> .
The recipient ' s heart showed the features of apical <START:Disease> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> with abundant eosinophils .
<START:Disease> Myocarditis <END> is rare and <START:Disease> eosinophilic myocarditis <END> is rarer .
It is likely that the <START:Disease> hypersensitivity <END> ( <START:Disease> eosinophilic <END> ) <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> was related to <START:Chemical> dobutamine <END> infusion therapy .
<START:Disease> Eosinophilic myocarditis <END> has been reported with an incidence of 2 . 4 % to 7 . 2 % in explanted hearts and may be related to multidrug therapy .
<START:Chemical> Succinylcholine <END> - induced <START:Disease> masseter muscle rigidity <END> during bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body .
<START:Disease> Masseter muscle rigidity <END> during general anesthesia is considered an early warning sign of a possible episode of <START:Disease> malignant hyperthermia <END> .
The decision whether to continue or discontinue the procedure depends on the urgency of the surgery and severity of <START:Disease> masseter muscle rigidity <END> .
Here , we describe a case of severe <START:Disease> masseter muscle rigidity <END> ( <START:Disease> jaw of steel <END> ) after <START:Chemical> succinylcholine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Sch <END> ) administration during general anesthetic management for rigid bronchoscopic removal of a tracheal foreign body .
Anesthesia was continued uneventfully with <START:Chemical> propofol <END> infusion while all facilities were available to detect and treat <START:Disease> malignant hyperthermia <END> .
Co - <START:Disease> carcinogenic <END> effect of <START:Chemical> retinyl acetate <END> on <START:Disease> forestomach carcinogenesis <END> of male F 344 rats induced with <START:Chemical> butylated hydroxyanisole <END> .
The potential modifying effect of <START:Chemical> retinyl acetate <END> ( <START:Chemical> RA <END> ) on <START:Chemical> butylated hydroxyanisole <END> ( <START:Chemical> BHA <END> ) - induced rat <START:Disease> forestomach tumorigenesis <END> was examined .
Male F 344 rats , 5 weeks of age , were maintained on diet containing 1 % or 2 % <START:Chemical> BHA <END> by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with <START:Chemical> RA <END> at various concentrations ( w / v ) for 52 weeks .
In groups given 2 % <START:Chemical> BHA <END> , although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals , co - administration of 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> RA <END> significantly ( P less than 0 . 05 ) increased the incidence of <START:Disease> forestomach tumors <END> ( <START:Disease> squamous cell papilloma <END> and <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> ) to 60 % ( 9 / 15 , 2 rats with <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> ) from 15 % ( 3 / 20 , one rat with <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> ) in the group given <START:Chemical> RA <END> - free water .
In rats given 1 % <START:Chemical> BHA <END> , <START:Chemical> RA <END> co - administered at a dose of 0 . 05 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 or 0 . 25 % showed a dose - dependent enhancing effect on the development of the <START:Chemical> BHA <END> - induced <START:Disease> epithelial hyperplasia <END> .
<START:Disease> Tumors <END> , all <START:Disease> papillomas <END> , were induced in 3 rats ( 17 % ) with 0 . 25 % <START:Chemical> RA <END> and in one rat ( 10 % ) with 0 . 05 % <START:Chemical> RA <END> co - administration .
<START:Chemical> RA <END> alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach .
These findings indicate that <START:Chemical> RA <END> acted as a co - carcinogen in the <START:Chemical> BHA <END> <START:Disease> forestomach carcinogenesis <END> of the rat .
A measure of <START:Disease> pupillary oscillation <END> as a marker of <START:Chemical> cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> paranoia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Cocaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> paranoia <END> ( <START:Disease> CIP <END> ) remains an important drug - induced model of idiopathic <START:Disease> paranoia <END> for which no psychophysiologic marker has yet emerged .
Measures of <START:Disease> pupillary oscillation <END> were able to significantly distinguish a group of abstinent <START:Chemical> crack cocaine <END> abusers endorsing past <START:Disease> CIP <END> ( n = 32 ) from another group of <START:Chemical> crack <END> addicts who denied past <START:Disease> CIP <END> ( n = 29 ) .
Acute <START:Disease> low back pain <END> during intravenous administration of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> : a report of two cases .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent - onset <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:Disease> AF <END> ) and maintenance of sinus rhythm .
We briefly describe two patients suffering from recent - onset <START:Disease> atrial fibrillation <END> , who experienced an acute devastating <START:Disease> low back pain <END> a few minutes after initiation of intravenous <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> loading .
Notably , this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical literature .
Clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution .
A catch in the <START:Disease> Reye <END> .
Twenty - six cases of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> from The Children ' s Hospital , Camperdown , Australia , occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed .
Of these , 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> .
<START:Chemical> Aspirin <END> or <START:Chemical> salicylate <END> ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases ( 5 % ) , and <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ) had been administered in only six of the cases ( 30 % ) .
Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> was accomplished in 90 % of the cases .
The incidence of <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> in New South Wales , Australia , is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain .
The mortality for these <START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> cases in Australia was 45 % as compared with a 32 % case - fatality rate in the United States .
In Australia , the pediatric usage of <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> has been extremely low for the past 25 years ( less than 1 % of total dosage units sold ) , with <START:Chemical> paracetamol <END> ( <START:Chemical> acetaminophen <END> ) dominating the pediatric analgesic and antipyretic market .
<START:Disease> Reye syndrome <END> may be disappearing from Australia despite a total lack of association with <START:Chemical> salicylates <END> or <START:Chemical> aspirin <END> ingestion , since there were no cases found at The Children ' s Hospital in 1983 , 1984 , or 1985 .
<START:Chemical> Penicillamine <END> - induced rapidly progressive <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> in a patient with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
A 67 - year - old woman with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> presented rapidly progressive <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> ( <START:Disease> RPGN <END> ) after 5 months of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> ( 250 mg / day ) treatment .
Light microscopy study showed severe <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> with crescent formation in 60 % of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteriole .
Immunofluorescence revealed scanty granular IgG , IgA and C 3 deposits along the capillary walls and mesangium .
The patient was treated with <START:Chemical> steroid <END> pulse , plasmapheresis , <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> and <START:Chemical> antiplatelet agents <END> .
A complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few weeks .
This new case of <START:Disease> RPGN <END> in the course of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> in these patients .
The prompt discontinuation of <START:Chemical> D - penicillamine <END> and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case .
<START:Disease> Type B hepatitis <END> after needle - stick exposure : prevention with <START:Disease> hepatitis B <END> immune globulin .
Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> immune globulin ( HBIG ) and immune serum globulin ( ISG ) were examined in a randomized , double - blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing <START:Disease> type B hepatitis <END> after needle - stick exposure to <START:Chemical> hepatitis B surface antigen <END> ( <START:Chemical> HBsAG <END> ) - positive donors .
Clinical <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> developed in 1 . 4 % of HBIG and in 5 . 9 % of ISG recipients ( P = 0 . 016 ) , and seroconversion ( anti - HBs ) occurred in 5 . 6 % and 20 . 7 % of them respectively ( P less than 0 . 001 ) .
Mild and transient side - effects were noted in 3 . 0 % of ISG and in 3 . 2 % of HBIG recipients .
Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase ( DNAP ) and e antigen and antibody ( <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> ; anti - HBE ) .
Both DNAP and <START:Chemical> HBeAg <END> showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of <START:Chemical> HBsAg <END> - positive donors .
<START:Disease> Hepatitis B <END> immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing <START:Disease> type B hepatitis <END> even when the analysis was confined to these two high - risk subgroups .
The efficacy of ISG in preventing <START:Disease> type B hepatitis <END> cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included .
<START:Chemical> Nimodipine <END> prevents <START:Disease> memory impairment <END> caused by <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> in adult mice .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hypotension <END> and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of <START:Disease> cognitive dysfunction <END> .
We tested the hypothesis that <START:Chemical> nimodipine <END> ( <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> ) administered at the onset of <START:Chemical> nitroglycerin <END> ( <START:Chemical> NTG <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> would preserve long - term associative memory .
METHODS : The passive avoidance ( PA ) paradigm was used to assess memory retention .
For PA training , latencies ( seconds ) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered .
Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial .
Ninety - six Swiss - Webster mice ( 30 - 35 g , 6 - 8 wk ) , were randomized into 6 groups 1 ) saline ( control ) , 2 ) <START:Chemical> NTG <END> immediately after learning , 3 ) <START:Chemical> NTG <END> 3 h after learning , 4 ) <START:Chemical> NTG <END> and <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> , 5 ) vehicle , and 6 ) <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> alone .
The extent of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and changes in brain tissue oxygenation ( PbtO ( 2 )) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals .
RESULTS : All groups exhibited similar training latencies ( 17 . 0 + / - 4 . 6 s ) .
Mice subjected to <START:Disease> hypotensive <END> episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time ( 178 + / - 156 s ) compared with those injected with saline , <START:Chemical> NTG <END> + <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> , or delayed <START:Chemical> NTG <END> ( 580 + / - 81 s , 557 + / - 67 s , and 493 + / - 146 s , respectively ) .
A Kruskal - Wallis 1 - way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups ( H = 15 . 34 ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies , the same dose of <START:Chemical> NTG <END> ( n = 3 ) and <START:Chemical> NTG <END> + <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> ( n = 3 ) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85 . 9 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg sem to 31 . 6 + / - 0 . 8 mm Hg sem and from 86 . 2 + / - 3 . 7 mm Hg sem to 32 . 6 + / - 0 . 2 mm Hg sem , respectively .
Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> alone decreased from 88 . 1 + / - 3 . 8 mm Hg to 80 . 0 + / - 2 . 9 mm Hg .
The intergroup difference was statistically significant ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
PbtO ( 2 ) decreased from 51 . 7 + / - 4 . 5 mm Hg sem to 33 . 8 + / - 5 . 2 mm Hg sem in the <START:Chemical> NTG <END> group and from 38 . 6 + / - 6 . 1 mm Hg sem to 25 . 4 + / - 2 . 0 mm Hg sem in the <START:Chemical> NTG <END> + <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> groups , respectively .
There were no significant differences among groups .
CONCLUSION : In a PA retention paradigm , the injection of <START:Chemical> NTG <END> immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long - term associative memory in mice , whereas delayed induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> had no effect .
<START:Chemical> NIMO <END> attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long - term memory caused by <START:Chemical> NTG <END> but did not improve latency in the absence of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> .
The observed effect of <START:Chemical> NIMO <END> may have been attributable to the preservation of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> homeostasis during <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , because there were no differences in the PbtO ( 2 ) indices among groups .
Enhanced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> .
High doses of <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> increase <START:Disease> hypotension <END> induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex <START:Disease> tachycardia <END> to <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain <START:Chemical> gamma - aminobutyric acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> GABA <END> ) .
In the present study , the possible enhancement by <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> of <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> induced by beta - adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with <START:Chemical> chloralose <END> - <START:Chemical> urethane <END> .
<START:Chemical> Isoniazid <END> significantly increased <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> after <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , <START:Chemical> pindolol <END> , <START:Chemical> labetalol <END> and <START:Chemical> atenolol <END> , as well as after <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , but not after <START:Chemical> hexamethonium <END> or <START:Chemical> carbachol <END> .
Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with <START:Chemical> methylatropine <END> or previously vagotomised .
These results are compatible with interference by <START:Chemical> isoniazid <END> with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone .
Such interference could be exerted centrally , possibly at the nucleus ambiguus , or peripherally at the sinus node .
Acute changes of blood <START:Chemical> ammonia <END> may predict short - term adverse effects of <START:Chemical> valproic acid <END> .
<START:Chemical> Valproic acid <END> ( <START:Chemical> VPA <END> ) was given to 24 <START:Disease> epileptic <END> patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic drugs .
A standardized loading dose of <START:Chemical> VPA <END> was administered , and venous blood was sampled at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 hours .
<START:Chemical> Ammonia <END> ( <START:Chemical> NH 3 <END> ) was higher in patients who , during continuous therapy , complained of <START:Disease> drowsiness <END> ( 7 patients ) than in those who were symptom - free ( 17 patients ) , although <START:Chemical> VPA <END> plasma levels were similar in both groups .
By measuring <START:Chemical> VPA <END> - induced changes of blood <START:Chemical> NH 3 <END> content , it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of obtundation when <START:Chemical> VPA <END> is given chronically .
Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> .
Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin - <START:Chemical> angiotensin <END> system proteins are altered in rats with <START:Disease> nephrotic syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NS <END> ) .
In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) levels of angiotensinogen ( Ao ) were analyzed with the slot - blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues : kidney , heart , brain , and adrenal gland from control , <START:Disease> nephrotic <END> , and pair - fed ( PF ) rats .
<START:Disease> NS <END> was induced by a single injection of <START:Chemical> puromycin amino - nucleoside <END> ( <START:Chemical> PAN <END> ) .
Although a great urinary excretion and half - normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after <START:Chemical> PAN <END> injection , when <START:Disease> NS <END> was clearly established , hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change .
Furthermore , the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6 , nor did its hepatic levels at days 1 , 3 , 5 , or 7 after <START:Chemical> PAN <END> injection .
These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute <START:Disease> NS <END> induced by <START:Chemical> PAN <END> .
Therapeutic drug monitoring of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> : once - daily versus twice - daily dosage schedules .
OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen ( once - daily vs . twice - daily ) of <START:Chemical> tobramicyn <END> on steady - state serum concentrations and <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : Patients undergoing treatment with i . v . <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> ( 4 mg / kg / day ) were randomised to two groups .
Group OD ( n = 22 ) received a once - daily dose of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> and group TD ( n = 21 ) received the same dose divided into two doses daily .
<START:Chemical> Tobramycin <END> serum concentrations ( peak and trough ) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay .
The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before , during and immediately after treatment .
RESULTS : The two groups were comparable with respect to sex , age , body weight and renal function .
No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose , duration of treatment , or cumulative dose .
Trough concentrations were < 2 g / ml in the two groups ( 100 % ) .
Peak concentrations were > 6 microg / ml in 100 % of the OD group and in 67 % of the TD group ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
Mean peak concentrations were markedly different : 11 . 00 + / - 2 . 89 microg / ml in OD vs . 6 . 53 + / - 1 . 45 microg / ml in TD ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
The pharmacokinetics parameters were : Ke , ( 0 . 15 + / - 0 . 03 / h in OD vs . 0 . 24 + / - 0 . 06 / h in TD ) , t 1 / 2 , ( 4 . 95 + / - 1 . 41 h in OD vs . 3 . 07 + / - 0 . 71 h in TD ) , Vd ( 0 . 35 + / - 0 . 11 l / kg in OD vs . 0 . 33 + / - 0 . 09 l / kg in TD ) , Cl ( 0 . 86 + / - 0 . 29 ml / min / kg in OD vs . 1 . 28 + / - 0 . 33 ml / min / kg in TD ) .
Increased serum <START:Chemical> creatinine <END> was observed in 73 % of patients in OD versus 57 % of patients in TD , without evidence of <START:Disease> nephrotoxicity <END> .
In TD group , three patients developed <START:Disease> decreased auditory function <END> , of which one presented with an <START:Disease> auditory loss <END> of - 30 dB , whereas in the OD group only one patient presented <START:Disease> decreased auditory function <END> .
CONCLUSION : This small study suggests that a once - daily dosing regimen of <START:Chemical> tobramycin <END> is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice - daily regimen .
Using a single - dose therapy , peak concentration determination is not necessary , only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg / ml .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in children with left - sided <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> .
Two children with <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> of the left kidney experienced severe <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> after irradiation to the <START:Disease> tumor <END> bed and conventional dosage of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> .
The <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> is attributed 1 ) to the fact that radiation fields for left <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> include the lower portion of the heart and 2 ) to the interaction of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and irradiation on cardiac muscle .
It is recommended that <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> dosage be sharply restricted in children with <START:Disease> Wilms tumor <END> of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation .
Effect of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function .
OBJECTIVES : To assess changes induced by <START:Chemical> lithium <END> maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid , parathyroid and ion alterations .
These were evaluated with respect to the duration of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy , age , sex , and family history ( whether or not the patient had a first - degree relative with <START:Disease> thyroid disease <END> ) .
DESIGN : Prospective study .
SETTING : Affective Disorders Clinic at St . Mary ' s Hospital , Montreal .
PATIENTS : One hundred and one patients ( 28 men and 73 women ) with <START:Disease> bipolar disorder <END> receiving <START:Chemical> lithium <END> maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year ' s to 32 years ' duration .
The control group consisted of 82 patients with no <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital ' s out - patient clinics .
OUTCOME MEASURES : Laboratory analyses of <START:Chemical> calcium <END> , <START:Chemical> magnesium <END> and thyroid - stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy and at biannual follow - up .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Hypothyroidism <END> developed in 40 patients , excluding 8 patients who were <START:Disease> hypothyroid <END> at baseline .
All patients having first - degree relatives affected by <START:Disease> thyroid illness <END> had accelerated onset of <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> ( 3 . 7 years after onset of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy ) compared with patients without a family history ( 8 . 6 years after onset of <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy ) .
Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> than women under 60 years of age ( 34 . 6 % versus 31 . 9 % ) .
<START:Chemical> Magnesium <END> levels in patients on <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment were unchanged from baseline levels .
After <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment , <START:Chemical> calcium <END> levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels .
Thus , <START:Chemical> lithium <END> treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma <START:Chemical> calcium <END> levels associated with aging .
CONCLUSIONS : Familial <START:Disease> thyroid illness <END> is a risk factor for <START:Disease> hypothyroidism <END> and <START:Disease> hypercalcemia <END> during <START:Chemical> lithium <END> therapy .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> - induced <START:Disease> inflammation <END> and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin B 1 receptor .
Clinical use of the <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DOX <END> ) is limited by its <START:Disease> cardiotoxic <END> effects , which are attributed to the induction of apoptosis .
To elucidate the possible role of the kinin B 1 receptor ( B 1 R ) during the development of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> , we studied B 1 R knockout mice ( B 1 R ( - / - )) by investigating cardiac <START:Disease> inflammation <END> and apoptosis after induction of <START:Chemical> DOX <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
<START:Chemical> DOX <END> control mice showed <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> measured by pressure - volume loops in vivo .
This was associated with a reduced activation state of AKT , as well as an increased bax / bcl 2 ratio in Western blots , indicating <START:Disease> cardiac apoptosis <END> .
Furthermore , mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissue .
In <START:Chemical> DOX <END> B 1 R ( - / - ) mice , <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> was improved compared to <START:Chemical> DOX <END> control mice , which was associated with normalization of the bax / bcl - 2 ratio and interleukin 6 , as well as AKT activation state .
These findings suggest that B 1 R is detrimental in <START:Chemical> DOX <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apoptosis .
These insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing B 1 R antagonists for treatment of human <START:Chemical> DOX <END> <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
A randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> for SSRI - induced female <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> .
The objective of this study was to determine whether <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> , an alpha - and beta - adrenergic agonist previously shown to enhance genital blood flow in women , has beneficial effects in reversing antidepressant - induced <START:Disease> sexual dysfunction <END> .
Nineteen <START:Disease> sexually dysfunctional <END> women receiving either <START:Chemical> fluoxetine <END> , <START:Chemical> sertraline <END> , or <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> participated in an eight - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study of the effects of <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> ( 50 mg ) on self - report measures of sexual desire , arousal , orgasm , and sexual satisfaction .
Although there were significant improvements relative to baseline in sexual desire and orgasm intensity / pleasure on 50 mg <START:Chemical> ephedrine <END> 1 - hr prior to sexual activity , significant improvements in these measures , as well as in sexual arousal and orgasmic ability also were noted with placebo .
These findings highlight the importance of conducting placebo - controlled trials for this condition .
<START:Chemical> Pilocarpine <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> cause age - dependent <START:Disease> impairment in auditory location discrimination <END> .
Children who have <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> have continuous or rapidly repeating <START:Disease> seizures <END> that may be life - threatening and may cause life - long changes in brain and behavior .
The extent to which <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> causes <START:Disease> deficits in auditory discrimination <END> is unknown .
A naturalistic auditory location discrimination method was used to evaluate this question using an animal model of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> .
Male Sprague - Dawley rats were injected with saline on postnatal day ( P ) 20 , or a convulsant dose of <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> on P 20 or P 45 .
<START:Chemical> Pilocarpine <END> on either day induced <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ; <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> at P 45 resulted in CA 3 cell loss and spontaneous <START:Disease> seizures <END> , whereas P 20 rats had no cell loss or spontaneous <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
Mature rats were trained with sound - source location and sound - silence discriminations .
Control ( saline P 20 ) rats acquired both discriminations immediately .
In <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( P 20 ) rats , acquisition of the sound - source location discrimination was moderately impaired .
<START:Disease> Status epilepticus <END> ( P 45 ) rats failed to acquire either sound - source location or sound - silence discriminations .
<START:Disease> Status epilepticus <END> in rat causes an age - dependent , long - term <START:Disease> impairment in auditory discrimination <END> .
This impairment may explain one cause of <START:Disease> impaired auditory location discrimination <END> in humans .
Serotonergic drugs , <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> and <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> block <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> in a strain of mice .
In male Swiss mice , <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> produced <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> .
A 3 mg / kg ( i . p . ) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min . Increasing the brain <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> levels by the administration of <START:Chemical> 5 - hydroxytryptophan <END> ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> effect .
However , in a similar experiment <START:Chemical> l - dopa <END> ( 80 - 160 mg / kg ) was without effect .
In doses of 3 - 10 mg / kg , the <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> receptor agonist <START:Chemical> MK - 212 <END> caused a dose - dependent blockade of the response of <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> .
Of the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> , <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 3 mg / kg ) was found to be several fold more potent than <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> ( 0 . 3 - 3 mg / kg ) in blocking the <START:Disease> myoclonic jerks <END> .
While ( - ) - <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> ( 1 - 3 mg / kg ) proved to be an effective antagonist of <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> , its ( + ) - isomer ( 5 - 20 mg / kg ) lacked this property .
Considering the fact that <START:Chemical> 5 - HTP <END> and the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepines <END> have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> , the <START:Chemical> muscimol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition .
Our present study indicated the possible value of <START:Chemical> MK - 212 <END> and ( - ) - <START:Chemical> baclofen <END> in the management of clinical <START:Disease> myoclonus <END> .
Is <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> administration safe in a <START:Disease> hypothermic <END> child ?
A male neonate with a <START:Disease> Chiari malformation <END> and a leaking myelomeningocoele underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion followed by repair of myelomeningocoele .
During anaesthesia and surgery , he inadvertently became moderately <START:Disease> hypothermic <END> .
Intravenous <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> was administered during the later part of the surgery for <START:Disease> seizure <END> prophylaxis .
Following <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> administration , the patient developed acute severe <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , refractory to <START:Chemical> atropine <END> and <START:Chemical> adrenaline <END> .
The cardiac depressant actions of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> and <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> can be additive .
Administration of <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> in the presence of <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> may lead to an adverse cardiac event in children .
As <START:Chemical> phenytoin <END> is a commonly used drug , clinicians need to be aware of this interaction .
High <START:Chemical> fat <END> diet - fed <START:Disease> obese <END> rats are highly sensitive to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Often , chemotherapy by <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> Adriamycin <END> ) is limited due to life threatening <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> in patients during and posttherapy .
Recently , we have shown that moderate diet restriction remarkably protects against <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and <START:Chemical> triglycerides <END> and increased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation , <START:Chemical> ATP <END> synthesis , and upregulated JAK / STAT 3 pathway .
In the current study , we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40 % high <START:Chemical> fat <END> diet ( HFD ) , which induces <START:Disease> obesity <END> in male Sprague - Dawley rats ( 250 - 275 g ) , sensitizes to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
A LD ( 10 ) dose ( 8 mg <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> / kg , ip ) administered on day 43 of the HFD feeding regimen led to higher <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> , <START:Disease> cardiac dysfunction <END> , lipid peroxidation , and 80 % mortality in the <START:Disease> obese <END> ( <START:Disease> OB <END> ) rats in the absence of any significant <START:Disease> renal or hepatic toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Doxorubicin <END> toxicokinetics studies revealed no change in accumulation of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> and <START:Chemical> doxorubicinol <END> ( toxic metabolite ) in the normal diet - fed ( ND ) and <START:Disease> OB <END> hearts .
Mechanistic studies revealed that <START:Disease> OB <END> rats are sensitized due to : ( 1 ) higher oxyradical stress leading to upregulation of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 , ( 2 ) downregulation of cardiac peroxisome proliferators activated receptor - alpha , ( 3 ) decreased plasma adiponectin levels , ( 4 ) decreased cardiac fatty - acid oxidation ( 666 . 9 + / - 14 . 0 nmol / min / g heart in ND versus 400 . 2 + / - 11 . 8 nmol / min / g heart in <START:Disease> OB <END> ) , ( 5 ) decreased mitochondrial <START:Chemical> AMP <END> - alpha 2 protein kinase , and ( 6 ) 86 % drop in cardiac <START:Chemical> ATP <END> levels accompanied by decreased <START:Chemical> ATP <END> / <START:Chemical> ADP <END> ratio after <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> administration .
Decreased cardiac erythropoietin and increased SOCS 3 further downregulated the cardioprotective JAK / STAT 3 pathway .
In conclusion , HFD - induced <START:Disease> obese <END> rats are highly sensitized to <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> by substantially downregulating cardiac mitochondrial <START:Chemical> ATP <END> generation , increasing oxidative stress and downregulating the JAK / STAT 3 pathway .
A cross - sectional evaluation of the effect of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in boys .
OBJECTIVE : The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> on trabecular bone mineral density ( BMD ) in children and adolescents .
METHOD : Medically healthy 7 - to 17 - year - old males chronically treated , in a naturalistic setting , with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> were recruited for this cross - sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between November 2005 and June 2007 .
Anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conducted .
The clinical diagnoses were based on chart review , and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical record .
Volumetric BMD of the ultradistal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography , and areal BMD of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Hyperprolactinemia <END> was present in 49 % of 83 boys ( n = 41 ) treated with <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> for a mean of 2 . 9 years .
Serum <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
As expected , bone mineral content and BMD increased with sexual maturity .
After adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and BMI z scores , serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric BMD at the ultradistal radius ( P < . 03 ) .
Controlling for relevant covariates , we also found treatment with selective <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) to be associated with lower trabecular BMD at the radius ( P = . 03 ) and BMD z score at the lumbar spine ( P < . 05 ) .
These findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non - Hispanic white patients .
Of 13 documented <START:Disease> fractures <END> , 3 occurred after <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> and SSRIs were started , and none occurred in patients with <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> .
CONCLUSIONS : This is the first study to link <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperprolactinemia <END> and SSRI treatment to lower BMD in children and adolescents .
Future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensues .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> in war / tropical surgery ( a final tribute to the racemic mixture ) .
A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients , aged from 6 weeks to 70 years , undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates .
Operations lasting up to 2 h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air / <START:Chemical> oxygen <END> only .
After premedication with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> , <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> and local anaesthesia , and induction with standard doses of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> , a maintenance dose of 10 - 20 microg / kg / min of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> proved safe and effective .
Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring , relying heavily on the heart rate .
<START:Chemical> Diazepam <END> , unless contraindicated or risky , remains the only necessary complementary drug to <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> .
Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative <START:Disease> analgesia <END> .
An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h , <START:Chemical> glycopyrrolate <END> being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects , especially in a hot climate .
Experience in war / tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life - saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where , e . g . amputation and rapid extrication were required .
Effects of calcitonin on rat extrapyramidal motor system : behavioral and biochemical data .
The effects of i . v . c . injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system , were investigated in male rats .
Calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> - induced <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and a partial prevention of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hyperactivity <END> .
Moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nigral GAD activity but no change in striatal <START:Chemical> DA <END> and <START:Chemical> DOPAC <END> concentration or GAD activity .
The results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the striatonigral GABAergic pathway mediating the <START:Chemical> DA <END> - related behavioral messages of striatal origin .
Neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> protect against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - and <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced limbic <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> in mice .
Several structurally related metabolites of <START:Chemical> progesterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 20 - ones <END> ) and <START:Chemical> deoxycorticosterone <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 alpha - hydroxy pregnane - 21 - diol - 20 - ones <END> ) and their 3 beta - epimers were evaluated for protective activity against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - , <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - and <START:Chemical> N - methyl - D - aspartate <END> ( <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> in mice .
<START:Chemical> Steroids <END> with the 3 - hydroxy group in the alpha - position and 5 - H in the alpha - or beta - configurations were highly effective in protecting against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> ( 416 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced limbic motor <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> ( ED 50 values , 7 . 0 - 18 . 7 mg / kg , i . p . ) .
The corresponding epimers with the 3 - hydroxy group in the beta - position were also effective but less potent ( ED 50 values , 33 . 8 - 63 . 5 , i . p . ) .
Although the neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> were considerably less potent than the <START:Chemical> benzodiazepine <END> <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> in protecting against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> , <START:Chemical> steroids <END> with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - configuration had comparable or higher protective index values ( TD 50 for motor impairment divided by ED 50 for <START:Disease> seizure <END> protection ) than <START:Chemical> clonazepam <END> , indicating that some neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> may have lower relative <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> Steroids <END> with the 5 alpha , 3 alpha - or 5 beta , 3 alpha - configurations also produced a dose - dependent delay in the onset of limbic <START:Disease> seizures <END> induced by <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> ( 32 mg / kg , s . c . ) , but did not completely protect against the <START:Disease> seizures <END> .
However , when a second dose of the <START:Chemical> steroid <END> was administered 1 hr after the first dose , complete protection from the <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced limbic <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> was obtained .
The <START:Chemical> steroids <END> also caused a dose - dependent delay in <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> ( 257 mg / kg , s . c . ) - induced lethality , but did not completely protect against <START:Chemical> NMDA <END> <START:Disease> seizures <END> or lethality .
We conclude that neuroactive <START:Chemical> steroids <END> are highly effective in protecting against <START:Chemical> pilocarpine <END> - and <START:Chemical> kainic acid <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> and <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> in mice , and may be of utility in the treatment of some forms of <START:Disease> status epilepticus <END> in humans .
Pyeloureteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation : a case report .
The etiology of <START:Disease> pyeloureteritis cystica <END> has long been attributed to chronic <START:Disease> infection <END> and <START:Disease> inflammation <END> .
A case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyeloureteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radiography .
There is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent <START:Disease> infection <END> in this patient .
The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of <START:Chemical> heparin <END> therapy for suspected pelvic <START:Disease> thrombophlebitis <END> and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation .
The rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true <START:Disease> pyeloureteritis cystica <END> and <START:Disease> submucosal hemorrhage <END> .
<START:Disease> Cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> associated with <START:Chemical> oxacillin <END> .
A 67 - year - old man who was treated with <START:Chemical> oxacillin <END> for one week because of <START:Disease> Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia <END> , developed <START:Disease> renal failure <END> and diffuse , symmetric , palpable <START:Disease> purpuric lesions <END> on his feet .
<START:Disease> Necrotic blisters <END> were noted on his fingers .
Skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of <START:Disease> leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Oxacillin <END> was discontinued and patient was treated with <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> .
The <START:Disease> rash <END> disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal .
<START:Disease> Leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> presents as palpable <START:Disease> purpura <END> of the lower extremities often accompanied by <START:Disease> abdominal pain <END> , <START:Disease> arthralgia <END> , and <START:Disease> renal involvement <END> .
Etiologic factors or associated disorders include <START:Disease> infections <END> , medications , <START:Disease> collagen vascular disease <END> and <START:Disease> neoplasia <END> .
However , in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identified .
Usually it is a self - limited disorder , but <START:Chemical> corticosteroid <END> therapy may be needed in life - threatening cases since early treatment with <START:Chemical> corticosteroids <END> in severe cases can prevent complications .
<START:Chemical> Oxacillin <END> should be included among the drugs that can cause <START:Disease> leucocytoclastic vasculitis <END> .
Acute <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ) - loaded <START:Chemical> cyanoacrylate <END> nanoparticles .
Acute <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> - loaded nanoparticle ( DXNP ) <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> .
In normal rats , 2 / 6 rats given free <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> ( <START:Chemical> DX <END> ) ( 5 mg / kg ) died within one week , whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived .
A 3 times higher <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with <START:Chemical> DX <END> .
Free NP did not provoke any <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> .
Two hr post - injection , DXNP was 2 . 7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free <START:Chemical> DX <END> ( p < 0 . 025 ) .
In rats with immune experimental <START:Disease> glomerulonephritis <END> , 5 / 6 rats given <START:Chemical> DX <END> died within 7 days , in contrast to animals treated by DXNP , NP , or untreated , which all survived .
<START:Disease> Proteinuria <END> appeared in all series , but was 2 - 5 times more intense ( p > 0 . 001 ) and prolonged after <START:Chemical> doxorubicin <END> treatment ( 400 - 700 mg / day ) , without significant difference between DXNP and <START:Chemical> DX <END> .
Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls .
These results demonstrate that , in these experimental conditions , DXNP killed less animals than free <START:Chemical> DX <END> , despite of an enhanced <START:Disease> renal toxicity <END> of the former .
Both effects ( better survival and <START:Disease> nephrosis <END> ) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system , including mesangial cells .
<START:Chemical> Naloxazone <END> pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory , temperature , and behavioral effects of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of <START:Chemical> morphine <END> were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or <START:Chemical> naloxazone <END> , an antagonist of high - affinity mu 1 opioid receptors .
Pretreatment with <START:Chemical> naloxazone <END> significantly blocked <START:Chemical> morphine <END> <START:Disease> analgesia <END> , <START:Disease> catalepsy <END> and <START:Disease> hypothermia <END> at a dose which completely eliminated high - affinity binding in brain membranes .
Moreover , <START:Chemical> naloxazone <END> significantly attenuated the <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypotension <END> and <START:Disease> respiratory depression <END> , whereas <START:Chemical> morphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> was less affected .
Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to <START:Chemical> morphine <END> .
<START:Disease> Hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , and <START:Disease> asystole <END> after high - dose intravenous <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> in a monitored patient .
We report a case of <START:Disease> hypotension <END> , <START:Disease> bradycardia <END> , and <START:Disease> asystole <END> after intravenous administration of high - dose <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> in a 73 - year - old patient who underwent electrocardiographic ( ECG ) monitoring throughout the episode .
There was a history of <START:Disease> ischemic <END> <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> 9 years earlier .
The patient was admitted with a <START:Disease> pulmonary - renal syndrome <END> with <START:Disease> hemoptysis <END> , rapidly progressive <START:Disease> renal failure <END> , and <START:Disease> hypoxemia <END> that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit .
After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the patient recovered cardiac rhythm .
The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> .
This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of <START:Disease> sudden death <END> after a high dose of intravenous <START:Chemical> methylprednisolone <END> ( <START:Chemical> IVMP <END> ) .
These mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event .
Rapid infusion and underlying <START:Disease> cardiac disease <END> were important risk factors in the case reported here , and the authors discount <START:Disease> ventricular arrhythmia <END> as the main mechanism .
Antagonism of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced sedative effects by <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> in patients after surgery under lumbar epidural block .
A double - blind placebo - controlled investigation of efficacy and safety .
The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> and a placebo in reversing <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced effects after surgery under epidural block , and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> .
Fifty - seven patients were sedated with <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> for surgery under epidural anaesthesia .
Antagonism of <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced effects by <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> was investigated postoperatively in a double - blind placebo - controlled trial .
The patient ' s subjective assessment of mood rating , an objective test of performance , a test for <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug .
No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating , <START:Disease> amnesia <END> , or vital signs .
The <START:Chemical> Ro 15 - 1788 <END> group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug .
There was no evidence of reaction at the injection site .
<START:Disease> Hepatotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> .
<START:Chemical> Amiodarone <END> has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac <START:Disease> tachyarrhythmias <END> .
The use of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> has , however , been limited due to its serious side - effects .
A patient with <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> due to <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> treatment is presented below and a review of the <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> is given .
It is concluded that solid evidence exists of <START:Disease> hepatic injury <END> due to <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> treatment , including <START:Disease> steatosis <END> , alterations resembling <START:Disease> alcoholic hepatitis <END> , <START:Disease> cholestatic hepatitis <END> and micronodular <START:Disease> cirrhosis of the liver <END> .
Patients receiving <START:Chemical> amiodarone <END> should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme levels .
Therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of <START:Disease> cholestatic injury <END> or <START:Disease> hepatomegaly <END> .
rTMS of supplementary motor area modulates therapy - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson disease <END> .
The neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> are unclear .
Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) over the supplementary motor area ( SMA ) in a group of patients with advanced <START:Disease> Parkinson disease <END> , the authors investigated whether modulation of SMA excitability may result in a modification of a <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> state induced by continuous <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> infusion .
rTMS at 1 Hz was observed to markedly reduce <START:Disease> drug - induced dyskinesias <END> , whereas 5 - Hz rTMS induced a slight but not significant increase .
Sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> treated <START:Disease> immunodeficient <END> mice .
The <START:Disease> anaemia <END> induced by <START:Chemical> 3 ' - azido - 3 ' dideoxythymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) is poorly understood .
We have used a murine model of <START:Disease> AIDS <END> , <START:Disease> infection <END> of female C 57 BL / 6 mice with LP - BM 5 murine <START:Disease> leukaemia <END> ( MuLV ) virus , to determine if <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> anaemia <END> is due , in part , to decreased responsiveness of erythropoietic precursors ( BFU - e ) to erythropoietin ( EPO ) .
Mice in the early stage of LP - BM 5 MuLV disease were given <START:Chemical> AZT <END> in their drinking water at 1 . 0 and 2 . 5 mg / ml .
<START:Chemical> AZT <END> produced <START:Disease> anaemia <END> in both groups , in a dose - dependent fashion .
Despite the <START:Disease> anaemia <END> , the number of splenic and bone marrow BFU - e in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> treated mice increased up to five - fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treatment .
Colony formation by splenic and bone marrow BFUe was stimulated at lower concentrations of EPO in mice receiving <START:Chemical> AZT <END> for 15 d than for infected , untreated mice .
By day 30 , sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow BFU - e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated animals .
The mean plasma levels of EPO observed in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> treated mice were appropriate for the degree of <START:Disease> anaemia <END> observed when compared with <START:Chemical> phenylhydrazine <END> ( <START:Chemical> PHZ <END> ) treated mice .
The numbers of BFU - e and the percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts observed were comparable in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> and <START:Chemical> PHZ <END> treated mice with similar degrees of <START:Disease> anaemia <END> .
However , <START:Disease> reticulocytosis <END> was inappropriate for the degree of <START:Disease> anaemia <END> observed in <START:Chemical> AZT <END> treated infected mice .
<START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced peripheral <START:Disease> anaemia <END> in the face of increased numbers of BFU - e and increased levels of plasma EPO suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation .
<START:Disease> Pheochromocytoma <END> unmasked by <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> .
OBJECTIVE : To describe the unmasking of <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> in a patient treated with <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> .
CASE SUMMARY : A 42 - year - old white man developed acute <START:Disease> hypertension <END> with severe <START:Disease> headache <END> and <START:Disease> vomiting <END> 2 hours after the first doses of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> 100 mg and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> 100 mg . Both drugs were immediately discontinued , and the patient recovered after subsequent <START:Chemical> nicardipine <END> and <START:Chemical> verapamil <END> treatment .
Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass , and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> .
DISCUSSION : Drug - induced symptoms of <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> are often associated with the use of substituted <START:Chemical> benzamide <END> drugs , but the underlying mechanism is unknown .
In our case , use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> crisis and <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> therapy .
CONCLUSIONS : As of March 24 , 2005 , this is the first reported case of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> - and <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> - induced <START:Disease> hypertensive <END> crisis in a patient with <START:Disease> pheochromocytoma <END> .
Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of <START:Chemical> tiapride <END> and <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> .
Dual effects of <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> on <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> - induced <START:Disease> narcosis <END> in rats .
<START:Chemical> Melatonin <END> affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug - induced <START:Disease> narcosis <END> .
<START:Chemical> Sodium thiopenthal <END> was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre - treated with <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> ( 0 . 05 , 0 . 5 , 5 and 50 mg / kg ) .
<START:Chemical> Melatonin <END> pre - treatment affected in a dual manner <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> <START:Disease> narcosis <END> , however , no dose - effect correlation was found .
In particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> <START:Disease> narcosis <END> .
In contrast , the highest dose of <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of <START:Disease> narcosis <END> , and a reduction in mortality rate .
<START:Chemical> Melatonin <END> 0 . 5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - or <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> - induced <START:Disease> narcosis <END> .
Thus , the dual action of <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> on pharmacological <START:Disease> narcosis <END> seems to be specific for the <START:Chemical> barbiturate <END> mechanism of action .
Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:Disease> DCM <END> ) and <START:Disease> myocarditis <END> occur in many <START:Disease> HIV - infected <END> individuals , resulting in symptomatic <START:Disease> heart failure <END> in up to 5 % of patients .
Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of <START:Disease> acquired immunodeficiency syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> AIDS <END> ) , but has resulted in an increase in <START:Disease> cardiac and skeletal myopathies <END> .
METHODS AND RESULTS : In order to investigate whether the HAART component <START:Chemical> zidovudine <END> ( <START:Chemical> 3 ' - azido - 2 ' , 3 ' - deoxythymidine <END> ; <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) triggers the Fas - dependent cell - death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of <START:Disease> DCM <END> , 8 - week - old transgenic ( expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium : FasL Tg ) and non - transgenic ( NTg ) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ( 0 , 0 . 07 , 0 . 2 , and 0 . 7 mg / ml ) .
After 6 weeks , cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods .
NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function .
In contrast , <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - treated FasL Tg mice developed <START:Disease> cardiac dilation <END> and depressed cardiac function in a dose - dependent manner , with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles .
These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL , as well as increased activation of caspase 3 , translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere , and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis .
These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization , as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity .
CONCLUSIONS : The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium , as identified in HIV - positive patients , might increase the susceptibility to HAART - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> due to activation of apoptotic pathways , resulting in <START:Disease> cardiac dilation and dysfunction <END> .
An extremely rare case of <START:Disease> delusional parasitosis <END> in a <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> patient during <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha - 2 b <END> and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> treatment .
During treatment of <START:Disease> chronic hepatitis C <END> patients with interferon and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> , a lot of side effects are described .
Twenty - three percent to 44 % of patients develop <START:Disease> depression <END> .
A minority of patients evolve to <START:Disease> psychosis <END> .
To the best of our knowledge , no cases of <START:Disease> psychogenic parasitosis <END> occurring during interferon therapy have been described in the literature .
We present a 49 - year - old woman who developed a <START:Disease> delusional parasitosis <END> during treatment with <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha - 2 b <END> weekly and <START:Chemical> ribavirin <END> .
She complained of seeing parasites and the larvae of fleas in her stools .
This could not be confirmed by any technical examination .
All the complaints disappeared after stopping <START:Chemical> pegylated interferon alpha - 2 b <END> and reappeared after restarting it .
She had a complete sustained viral response .
Effect of nondopaminergic drugs on <START:Chemical> L - dopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> - treated monkeys .
A group of four monkeys was rendered <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> with the toxin <START:Chemical> MPTP <END> .
They were then treated chronically with <START:Chemical> L - DOPA / benserazide <END> 50 / 12 . 5 mg / kg given orally daily for 2 months .
This dose produced a striking antiparkinsonian effect , but all animals manifested <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> were then tested in combination with <START:Chemical> L - DOPA <END> to see if the <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> movements would be modified .
Several drugs , including <START:Chemical> clonidine <END> , <START:Chemical> physostigmine <END> , <START:Chemical> methysergide <END> , <START:Chemical> 5 - MDOT <END> , <START:Chemical> propranolol <END> , and <START:Chemical> MK - 801 <END> , markedly reduced the <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> movements but at the cost of a return of <START:Disease> parkinsonian <END> symptomatology .
However , <START:Chemical> yohimbine <END> and <START:Chemical> meperidine <END> reduced predominantly the <START:Disease> dyskinetic <END> movements .
<START:Chemical> Baclofen <END> was also useful in one monkey against a more <START:Disease> dystonic <END> form of <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> .
<START:Chemical> Atropine <END> converted the <START:Disease> dystonic <END> movements into <START:Disease> chorea <END> .
Memory function and <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> transporter promoter gene polymorphism in <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> ( <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> ) users .
Although <START:Chemical> 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine <END> ( <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> or <START:Chemical> ecstasy <END> ) has been shown to damage brain <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> ) neurons in animals and possibly humans , little is known about the long - term consequences of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> - induced <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> <START:Disease> neurotoxic lesions <END> on functions in which <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> is involved , such as cognitive function .
Because <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the <START:Chemical> 5 - HT <END> transporter promoter gene region ( 5 - HTTLPR ) when studying the effects of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> as well as cognitive functioning .
The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use on cognitive function , as well as the effects of long - term abstention from <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> , in subjects genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR .
A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males .
Fifteen moderate <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> users ( < 55 lifetime tablets ) , 22 heavy <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> + users ( > 55 lifetime tablets ) , 16 ex - <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> + users ( last tablet > 1 year ago ) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests .
DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5 - HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods . A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks ( p = 0 . 04 ) but not on reaction times ( p = 0 . 61 ) or attention / executive functioning ( p = 0 . 59 ) .
Heavy and ex - <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> + users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls .
In contrast , no evidence of <START:Disease> memory impairment <END> was observed in moderate <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> users .
No significant effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender was observed .
While the use of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> in quantities that may be considered " moderate " is not associated with <START:Disease> impaired memory functioning <END> , heavy use of <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use may lead to long lasting <START:Disease> memory impairments <END> .
No effect of 5 - HTTLPR or gender on memory function or <START:Chemical> MDMA <END> use was observed .
Deaths from local anesthetic - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in mice .
Median convulsant ( CD 50 ) and median lethal ( LD 50 ) doses of three representative local anesthetics were determined in adult mice to evaluate the threat to life of local anesthetic - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
The CD 50 and LD 50 , respectively , were 57 . 7 and 58 . 7 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> , 111 . 0 and 133 . 1 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> , and 243 . 4 and 266 . 5 mg / kg for <START:Chemical> chloroprocaine <END> .
When given intraperitoneally , <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> thus was only about twice as toxic as <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> and four times as toxic as <START:Chemical> chloroprocaine <END> .
<START:Disease> Convulsions <END> always preceded death , except after precipitous <START:Disease> cardiopulmonary arrest <END> from extreme doses .
A CD 50 dose of local anesthetic ( causing <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in 50 % of mice ) was fatal in 90 % of <START:Chemical> bupivacaine <END> - induced <START:Disease> seizures <END> , in 57 % of the <START:Chemical> chloroprocaine <END> group , and in 6 % of the <START:Chemical> lidocaine <END> group .
The narrow gap between convulsant and lethal doses of local anesthetics indicates that untreated <START:Disease> convulsions <END> present much more of a threat to life than heretofore appreciated .
Promotional effects of <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> and dietary fat on prostate <START:Disease> carcinogenesis <END> in genetically susceptible rats .
Germfree ( GF ) Lobund strain Wistar ( LW ) rats , fed vegetable diet L - 485 , have developed <START:Disease> prostate adenocarcinomas <END> spontaneously ( 10 % incidence ) at average age 34 months .
Conventional LW rats , implanted with <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> at age 4 months , developed a higher incidence of <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> after an average interval of 14 months : 24 % had developed gross <START:Disease> tumors <END> , and 40 % when it included microscopic <START:Disease> tumors <END> .
Preliminary results indicate that <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> - treated LW rats that were fed the same diet , which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20 % fat , developed <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> after intervals of 6 - 12 months .
Aged GF Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats have not developed <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> spontaneously .
Conventional SD rats fed diet L - 485 and treated with <START:Chemical> testosterone <END> developed only <START:Disease> prostatitis <END> .
Experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental <START:Disease> prostate cancer <END> .
<START:Disease> Cardiac toxicity <END> of <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> .
Report of a case of spontaneous <START:Disease> angina <END> .
We report a case of a patient with <START:Disease> colon carcinoma <END> and liver <START:Disease> metastasis <END> who presented <START:Disease> chest pain <END> after <START:Chemical> 5 - fluorouracil <END> ( <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> ) administration .
Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in <START:Disease> Prinzmetal ' s angina <END> , and <START:Disease> chest pain <END> promptly resolved with <START:Chemical> nifedipine <END> .
These data suggest that <START:Disease> coronary spasm <END> may be the cause of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> due to <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> , and that <START:Chemical> calcium <END> antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of <START:Chemical> 5 - FU <END> <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
Possible <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> related to concomitant treatment with <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> .
A 74 - year - old man with <START:Disease> depressive symptoms <END> was admitted to a <START:Disease> psychiatric <END> hospital due to <START:Disease> insomnia <END> , <START:Disease> loss of appetite <END> , exhaustion , and <START:Disease> agitation <END> .
Medical treatment was initiated at a daily dose of 20 mg <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and 1 . 2 mg <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> .
On the 10 th day of <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> treatment , the patient exhibited marked <START:Disease> psychomotor retardation <END> , disorientation , and severe <START:Disease> muscle rigidity <END> with <START:Disease> tremors <END> .
The patient had a <START:Disease> fever <END> ( 38 . 2 degrees C ) , fluctuating blood pressure ( between 165 / 90 and 130 / 70 mg mm Hg ) , and severe <START:Disease> extrapyramidal symptoms <END> .
Laboratory tests showed an elevation of <START:Chemical> creatine <END> phosphokinase ( 2218 IU / L ) , <START:Chemical> aspartate <END> aminotransferase ( 134 IU / L ) , <START:Chemical> alanine <END> aminotransferase ( 78 IU / L ) , and BUN ( 27 . 9 mg / ml ) levels .
The patient received <START:Chemical> bromocriptine <END> and <START:Chemical> diazepam <END> to treat his symptoms .
7 days later , the <START:Disease> fever <END> disappeared and the patient ' s serum CPK levels were normalized ( 175 IU / L ) .
This patient presented with symptoms of <START:Disease> neuroleptic malignant syndrome <END> ( <START:Disease> NMS <END> ) , thus demonstrating that <START:Disease> NMS <END> - like symptoms can occur after combined <START:Chemical> paroxetine <END> and <START:Chemical> alprazolam <END> treatment .
The adverse drug reaction score obtained by the Naranjo algorithm was 6 in our case , indicating a probable relationship between the patient ' s <START:Disease> NMS <END> - like adverse symptoms and the combined treatment used in this case .
The involvement of physiologic and environmental aspects specific to this patient was suspected .
Several risk factors for <START:Disease> NMS <END> should be noted in elderly <START:Disease> depressive <END> patients whose symptoms often include <START:Disease> dehydration <END> , <START:Disease> agitation <END> , <START:Disease> malnutrition <END> , and exhaustion .
Careful therapeutic intervention is necessary in cases involving elderly patients who suffer from <START:Disease> depression <END> .
<START:Chemical> Quinidine <END> <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Long - term administration of <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT , <START:Chemical> lactic acid <END> dehydrogenase , and alkaline phosphatase .
Liver biopsy showed active <START:Disease> hepatitis <END> .
Discontinuance of <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> therapy led to normalization of liver function tests .
A challenge dose of <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT , alkaline phosphatase , and <START:Chemical> lactic acid <END> dehydrogenase values .
We concluded that this patient had <START:Chemical> quinidine <END> <START:Disease> hepatotoxicity <END> and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy documentation .
This report also suggests that , even after long - term administration , the <START:Disease> hepatic toxicity <END> is reversible .
Multiple side effects of <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> therapy in one patient with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
<START:Disease> Skin rashes <END> , <START:Disease> proteinuria <END> , <START:Disease> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , <START:Disease> polymyositis <END> and <START:Disease> myasthenia gravis <END> have all been recorded as complications of <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> therapy in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> .
A patient who had developed all 5 is now described .
The <START:Disease> skin lesion <END> resembled <START:Disease> elastosis perforans serpiginosa <END> , which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with <START:Disease> Wilson ' s disease <END> but not in patients with <START:Disease> rheumatoid arthritis <END> treated with <START:Chemical> penicillamine <END> .
Fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> following topical administration of ophthalmic <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> .
A 73 - year - old woman died of <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> less than two months after undergoing <START:Disease> cataract <END> extraction and beginning topical therapy with <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> .
The first signs of <START:Disease> pancytopenia <END> began within one month of the surgery .
The pattern of the <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> was associated with an idiosyncratic response to <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> .
This was the second report of fatal <START:Disease> aplastic anemia <END> after topical treatment with <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> for ocular conditions , although two cases of reversible <START:Disease> bone marrow hypoplasia <END> have also been reported .
Any other suspected cases of <START:Disease> ocular toxicity <END> associated with topically applied <START:Chemical> chloramphenicol <END> should be reported to the National Registry of Drug - Induced Ocular Side Effects , Oregon Health Sciences University , Portland , OR 97201 .
<START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> and <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
BACKGROUND : <START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> as a symptom of central <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> are a known but poorly described side effect of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> .
Most cases of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> have been reported with other mental status changes .
METHODS : The authors interviewed six persons with <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> in the presence of a clear sensorium .
All patients were receiving high - dose <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> as part of their bone marrow transplant procedure .
RESULTS : <START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> occurred only when the patient ' s eyes were closed and , in all but one case , were reported as disturbing or frightening .
Underreporting of these <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> by patients is likely .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Disease> Hallucinations <END> may be the sole or first manifestation of <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
The incidence may be dose and infusion - time related .
The clinician should be alerted for possible <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> - induced <START:Disease> hallucinations <END> , which may occur without other signs of <START:Disease> neurotoxicity <END> .
" Eyes - closed " <START:Disease> hallucinatory <END> experiences appear to be an unusual feature of this presentation .
Patients anxious about this experience respond well to support and education about this occurrence .
Optimal pharmacologic management of disturbed patients is unclear .
If <START:Disease> agitation <END> becomes marked , high - potency neuroleptics ( i . e . , <START:Chemical> haloperidol <END> ) may be effective .
Effect of <START:Chemical> prostaglandin <END> synthetase inhibitors on experimentally induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> in rats .
To investigate the relationship of <START:Chemical> prostaglandins <END> ( <START:Chemical> PGs <END> ) to <START:Disease> seizure <END> induction , the effects of six PG synthetase inhibitors on <START:Disease> convulsions <END> induced by <START:Chemical> flurothyl <END> , <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> , <START:Chemical> pentetrazol <END> ( <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> ) , electroshock or <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> were evaluated .
<START:Chemical> Ibuprofen <END> , <START:Chemical> sulindac <END> , <START:Chemical> mefenamic acid <END> , and low dose <START:Chemical> meclofenamic acid <END> increased the latency - to - onset in the <START:Chemical> flurothyl <END> and / or <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> models ; the electroshock , <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> and <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> models were not significantly affected by any of the pretreatment agents .
These results suggest that <START:Chemical> PGs <END> are involved in the mechanism ( s ) underlying <START:Chemical> fluorthyl <END> - and <START:Chemical> PTZ <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> , but not <START:Chemical> picrotoxin <END> - , electroshock - , or <START:Chemical> bicuculline <END> - induced <START:Disease> convulsions <END> .
<START:Chemical> Benzylacyclouridine <END> reverses <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> - induced <START:Disease> marrow suppression <END> without impairment of anti - human <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> virus activity .
Increased extracellular concentrations of <START:Chemical> uridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> Urd <END> ) have been reported to reduce , in vitro , <START:Chemical> azidothymidine <END> ( <START:Chemical> AZT <END> ) - induced inhibition of human granulocyte - macrophage progenitor cells without impairment of its antihuman <START:Disease> immunodeficiency <END> virus ( HIV ) activity .
Because of the clinical <START:Disease> toxicities <END> associated with chronic <START:Chemical> Urd <END> administration , the ability of <START:Chemical> benzylacyclouridine <END> ( <START:Chemical> BAU <END> ) to effect , in vivo , <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> was assessed .
This agent inhibits <START:Chemical> Urd <END> catabolism and , in vivo , increases the plasma concentration of <START:Chemical> Urd <END> in a dose - dependent manner , without <START:Chemical> Urd <END> - related <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
In mice rendered <START:Disease> anemic <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenic <END> by the administration of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> for 28 days in drinking water ( 1 . 5 mg / mL ) , the continued administration of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> plus daily <START:Chemical> BAU <END> ( 300 mg / kg , orally ) partially reversed <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> anemia <END> and <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> ( P less than . 05 ) , increased peripheral reticulocytes ( to 4 . 9 % , P less than . 01 ) , increased cellularity in the marrow , and improved <START:Disease> megaloblastosis <END> .
When coadministered with <START:Chemical> AZT <END> from the onset of drug administration , <START:Chemical> BAU <END> reduced <START:Chemical> AZT <END> - induced <START:Disease> marrow toxicity <END> .
In vitro , at a concentration of 100 mumol / L , <START:Chemical> BAU <END> possesses minimal anti - HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of <START:Chemical> AZT <END> to reverse the HIV - induced cytopathic effect in MT 4 cells .
The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed .
Force overflow and <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> .
We assessed force coordination of the hand in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> and its relationship to motor complications of <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> therapy , particularly to <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> LID <END> ) .
We studied two groups of <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> patients with ( <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> , n = 23 ) and without <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> - induced <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> ( <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> - <START:Disease> LID <END> , n = 10 ) , and age - matched healthy controls .
The motor score of the Unified <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s Disease <END> Rating Scale , a <START:Disease> dyskinesia <END> score and force in a grip - lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> .
A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON - state in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> only .
In <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> , the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by <START:Chemical> levodopa <END> ( by 61 % , P < 0 . 05 ) .
An overshooting of peak grip force by 51 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) and of static grip force by 45 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) was observed in the ON - compared with the OFF - drug condition .
In contrast , no excessive force was found in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> - <START:Disease> LID <END> .
Peak grip force in ON - state was 140 % ( P < 0 . 05 ) higher in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> + <START:Disease> LID <END> than in <START:Disease> Parkinson ' s disease <END> - <START:Disease> LID <END> , while static grip force was increased by 138 % ( P < 0 . 01 ) between groups .
Severity of peak - dose <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> was strongly correlated with grip force in ON - state ( r = 0 . 79 with peak force , P < 0 . 01 ) .
No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication .
Force excess was only observed in patients with <START:Disease> LID <END> and motor fluctuations .
A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and <START:Disease> dyskinesias <END> in the ON - drug condition .
We postulate that both <START:Disease> LID <END> and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations .
Role of <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> on biochemical alterations and antioxidant status in <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> in rats .
The current study dealt with the protective role of <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> , a <START:Chemical> polyphenol <END> from Mangifera indica Linn .
( Anacardiaceae ) , on <START:Chemical> isoproterenol <END> ( <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> ) - induced <START:Disease> myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:Disease> MI <END> ) in rats through its antioxidative mechanism .
Subcutaneous injection of <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> ( 200 mg / kg body weight in 1 ml saline ) to rats for 2 consecutive days caused <START:Disease> myocardial damage <END> in rat heart , which was determined by the increased activity of serum <START:Chemical> lactate <END> dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and <START:Chemical> creatine <END> phosphokinase isoenzymes ( CK - MB ) , increased <START:Chemical> uric acid <END> level and reduced plasma <START:Chemical> iron <END> binding capacity .
The protective role of <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> was analyzed by <START:Chemical> triphenyl tetrazolium chloride <END> ( <START:Chemical> TTC <END> ) test used for macroscopic enzyme mapping assay of the <START:Disease> ischemic myocardium <END> .
The heart tissue antioxidant enzymes such as <START:Chemical> superoxide <END> dismutase , catalase , <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> peroxidase , <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> transferase and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> reductase activities , non - enzymic antioxidants such as cerruloplasmin , <START:Chemical> Vitamin C <END> , <START:Chemical> Vitamin E <END> and <START:Chemical> glutathione <END> levels were altered in <START:Disease> MI <END> rats .
Upon pretreatment with <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> ( 100 mg / kg body weight suspended in 2 ml of <START:Chemical> dimethyl sulphoxide <END> ) given intraperitoneally for 28 days to <START:Disease> MI <END> rats protected the above - mentioned parameters to fall from the normal levels .
Activities of heart tissue enzymic antioxidants and serum non - enzymic antioxidants levels rose significantly upon <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> administration as compared to <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> - induced <START:Disease> MI <END> rats .
From the present study it is concluded that <START:Chemical> mangiferin <END> exerts a beneficial effect against <START:Chemical> ISPH <END> - induced <START:Disease> MI <END> due to its antioxidant potential , which regulated the tissues defense system against <START:Disease> cardiac damage <END> .
<START:Chemical> CCNU <END> ( <START:Chemical> lomustine <END> ) <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in dogs : a retrospective study ( 2002 - 07 ) .
OBJECTIVE : To describe the incidence of <START:Disease> haematological , renal , hepatic and gastrointestinal toxicities <END> in tumour - bearing dogs receiving <START:Chemical> 1 - ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - 3 - cyclohexyl - 1 - nitrosourea <END> ( <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> ) .
DESIGN : The medical records of 206 dogs that were treated with <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> at the Melbourne Veterinary Specialist Centre between February 2002 and December 2007 were retrospectively evaluated .
RESULTS : Of the 206 dogs treated with <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> , 185 met the inclusion criteria for at least one class of <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
<START:Chemical> CCNU <END> was used most commonly in the treatment of <START:Disease> lymphoma <END> , <START:Disease> mast cell tumour <END> , <START:Disease> brain tumour <END> , <START:Disease> histiocytic tumours <END> and <START:Disease> epitheliotropic lymphoma <END> .
Throughout treatment , 56 . 9 % of dogs experienced <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> , 34 . 2 % experienced <START:Disease> anaemia <END> and 14 . 2 % experienced <START:Disease> thrombocytopenia <END> .
<START:Disease> Gastrointestinal toxicosis <END> was detected in 37 . 8 % of dogs , the most common sign of which was <START:Disease> vomiting <END> ( 24 . 3 % ) .
Potential renal <START:Disease> toxicity <END> and elevated <START:Chemical> alanine <END> transaminase ( ALT ) concentration were reported in 12 . 2 % and 48 . 8 % of dogs , respectively .
The incidence of <START:Disease> hepatic failure <END> was 1 . 2 % .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> CCNU <END> - associated <START:Disease> toxicity <END> in dogs is common , but is usually not life threatening .
<START:Disease> REM sleep deprivation <END> changes behavioral response to catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation in rats .
The effects of <START:Disease> REM sleep deprivation <END> ( <START:Disease> REMD <END> ) on <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> and <START:Chemical> quipazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> head twitches <END> in rats were determined .
Forty - eight hr of <START:Disease> REMD <END> increased <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> - induced <START:Disease> aggressiveness <END> , and reduced ( immediately after completing of <START:Disease> REMD <END> ) or increased ( 96 hr after completing of <START:Disease> REMD <END> ) <START:Chemical> quipazine <END> - induced <START:Disease> head twitches <END> .
Results are discussed in terms of similarity to pharmacological effects of other antidepressive treatments .
Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women .
BACKGROUND : Hormone therapy ( HT ) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> , <START:Disease> osteoporosis <END> and <START:Disease> dementia <END> in older women .
This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005 .

SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised double - blind trials of HT versus placebo , taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women .
HT included <START:Chemical> oestrogens <END> , with or without <START:Chemical> progestogens <END> , via oral , transdermal , subcutaneous or transnasal routes .
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS : Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data .
MAIN RESULTS : Nineteen trials involving 41 , 904 women were included .
In relatively healthy women , combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> or coronary event ( after one year ' s use ) , <START:Disease> stroke <END> ( after three years ) , <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> and <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> .
Long - term <START:Chemical> oestrogen <END> - only HT significantly increased the risk of <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> , <START:Disease> stroke <END> and <START:Disease> gallbladder disease <END> ( after one to two years , three years and seven years ' use respectively ) , but did not significantly increase the risk of <START:Disease> breast cancer <END> .
The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of <START:Disease> fractures <END> and ( for combined HT ) <START:Disease> colon cancer <END> , with long - term use .
Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy ( i . e . generally fit , without overt disease ) and taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of <START:Disease> dementia <END> .
Among women with <START:Disease> cardiovascular disease <END> , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> . One
trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking <START:Chemical> oestrogen <END> - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .
The only significantly increased risk reported was for <START:Disease> venous thrombo - embolism <END> in women taking combined continuous HT : their absolute risk remained low , at less than 1 / 500 .
However , this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women .
AUTHORS ' CONCLUSIONS : HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease .
We need more evidence on the safety of HT for menopausal symptom control , though short - term use appears to be relatively safe for healthy younger women .
Effects of <START:Chemical> amine <END> pretreatment on <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> <START:Disease> catatonia <END> in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals .
The present studies were designed to clarify the role of <START:Chemical> catecholamines <END> and pineal idolamines on <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> catatonia <END> in the intact , pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat .
In the pinealectomized chick , pretreatment with <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> increased the duration of <START:Disease> catatonia <END> ( DOC ) after <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> , but pretreatment with <START:Chemical> norepinephrine <END> did not .
The pineal indolamines exhibited mixed actions .
<START:Chemical> Serotonin <END> and <START:Chemical> N - acetyl serotonin <END> which augmented <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> potentiated the <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick .
<START:Chemical> Ketamine <END> was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> did not augment the <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC whereas <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> continued to do so .
This study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the <START:Chemical> amines <END> on the pineal in spite of the immature blood - brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat .
In addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> DOC induced by <START:Chemical> melatonin <END> .
Furthermore , <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of <START:Chemical> ketamine <END> <START:Disease> catatonia <END> rather than directly on the pituitary .
<START:Disease> Cardiotoxic <END> and possible leukemogenic effects of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> in nonhuman primates .
10 monkeys ( macaques ) received <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg / m 2 ( 1 mg / kg ) .
8 of the 10 monkeys developed <START:Disease> congestive heart failure <END> at an average cumulative <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> dose ( 310 mg / m 2 ) well below that considered the safe upper limit ( 550 mg / m 2 ) in man .
Histologically , the <START:Disease> myocardial lesions <END> resembled those found in human <START:Chemical> anthracycline <END> - induced <START:Disease> cardiomyopathy <END> .
1 of the 10 monkeys developed <START:Disease> acute myeloblastic leukemia <END> after receiving 324 mg / m 2 of <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> ; the 10 th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of drug .
Our results suggest that <START:Chemical> adriamycin <END> is a more potent cardiotoxin in monkeys than in man , and that <START:Disease> leukemia <END> may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug .
Liposomal <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> in advanced <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> : a phase II study .
We report a non - randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> ( DaunoXome ) in the treatment of <START:Disease> AIDS <END> related <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> .
Eleven homosexual men with advanced <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> were entered in the trial .
Changes in size , colour and associated <START:Disease> oedema <END> of selected ' target ' lesions were measured .
Clinical , biochemical and haematological <START:Disease> toxicities <END> were assessed .
Ten subjects were evaluated .
A partial response was achieved in four , of whom two subsequently relapsed .
Stabilization of <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> occurred in the remaining six , maintained until the end of the trial period in four .
The drug was generally well tolerated , with few mild symptoms of <START:Disease> toxicity <END> .
The main problem encountered was haematological <START:Disease> toxicity <END> , with three subjects experiencing severe <START:Disease> neutropenia <END> ( neutrophil count < 0 . 5 x 10 ( 9 ) / l ) .
There was no evidence of <START:Disease> cardiotoxicity <END> .
In this small patient sample , liposomal <START:Chemical> daunorubicin <END> was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of <START:Disease> Kaposi ' s sarcoma <END> .
Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment in rats .
The development of <START:Disease> schizophrenia <END> may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events , in combination leading to overt disease .
We investigated the effect of an early stress , in the form of maternal deprivation , combined with a later stress , simulated by chronic periadolescent <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment , on behaviour in rats .
Acute treatment with <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> caused disruption of prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment , but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress .
<START:Chemical> Amphetamine <END> treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non - deprived groups , but was absent in both maternally deprived groups .
The <START:Chemical> serotonin <END> - 1 A receptor agonist , <START:Chemical> 8 - OH - DPAT <END> , induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups .
<START:Chemical> Amphetamine <END> - induced <START:Disease> locomotor hyperactivity <END> was similar in all groups .
These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress , caused by maternal deprivation , combined with ' adolescent ' stress , simulated by <START:Chemical> corticosterone <END> treatment , on dopaminergic regulation of PPI .
The altered effects of <START:Chemical> apomorphine <END> and <START:Chemical> amphetamine <END> could indicate differential changes in <START:Chemical> dopamine <END> receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation , or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus .
<START:Chemical> Ifosfamide <END> continuous infusion without <START:Chemical> mesna <END> .
A phase I trial of a 14 - day cycle .
Twenty patients received 27 courses of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> administered as a 24 - hour continuous infusion for 14 days without <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> .
The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> that would be comparable to standard bolus or short - term infusions administered with <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> .
Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300 , 400 , 450 , 500 , and 550 mg / m 2 / d .
Four patients developed transient microscopic <START:Disease> hematuria <END> at 400 , 450 , and 500 mg / m 2 / d .
There were no instances of macroscopic <START:Disease> hematuria <END> .
At 550 mg / m 2 / d , three patients experienced nonurologic <START:Disease> toxicity <END> ; <START:Disease> confusion <END> ( 1 ) , <START:Disease> nausea <END> ( 1 ) , and Grade 2 <START:Disease> leukopenia <END> ( 1 ) .
The recommended dose of 500 mg / m 2 / d delivers a total dose of 7 g / m 2 per cycle , which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short - term infusion .
Because few patients received multiple courses over time , the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial .
The frequency and predictability of <START:Disease> hematuria <END> are not precise , and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential , adding <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> to the infusate in patients with persistent <START:Disease> hematuria <END> .
The protracted infusion schedule for <START:Chemical> ifosfamide <END> permits convenient outpatient administration without <START:Chemical> Mesna <END> and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to 890 per cycle .
Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient , but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained .
<START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> -- a highly aggressive disease : analysis of 12 cases .
PURPOSE : We gained knowledge of the etiology , treatment and prevention of <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> urothelial cancer <END> .
MATERIALS AND METHODS : The medical records of 6 men and 6 women ( mean age 55 years ) with <START:Chemical> cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> bladder cancer <END> were reviewed .
RESULTS : All <START:Disease> tumors <END> were grade 3 or 4 transitional cell <START:Disease> carcinoma <END> .
Of the 5 patients initially treated with endoscopic resection alone only 1 is alive without disease .
Of the 6 patients who underwent early cystectomy 4 were alive at 24 to 111 months .
The remaining patient with extensive <START:Disease> cancer <END> underwent partial cystectomy for palliation and died 3 months later .
CONCLUSIONS : <START:Chemical> Cyclophosphamide <END> associated <START:Disease> bladder tumor <END> is an aggressive disease .
However , long - term survival is possible when radical cystectomy is performed for <START:Disease> bladder tumors <END> with any sign of invasion and for recurrent high grade disease , even when noninvasive .
<START:Chemical> Amisulpride <END> related <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> in an adolescent <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> .
<START:Disease> Tic disorders <END> can be effectively treated by atypical antipsychotics such as <START:Chemical> risperidone <END> , <START:Chemical> olanzapine <END> and <START:Chemical> ziprasidone <END> .
However , there are two case reports that show <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> , including motor and phonic variants , occurring during treatment with <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> or <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> .
We present a 15 - year - old girl <START:Disease> schizophrenic <END> who developed frequent <START:Disease> involuntary eye - blinking movements <END> after 5 months of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> treatment ( 1000 mg per day ) .
The <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> resolved completely after we reduced the dose of <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> down to 800 mg per day .
However , her <START:Disease> psychosis <END> recurred after the dose reduction .
We then placed her on an additional 100 mg per day of <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> .
She has been in complete remission under the combined medications for more than one year and maintains a fair role function .
No more <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> or other side effects have been reported .
Together with previously reported cases , our patient suggests that <START:Disease> tic - like symptoms <END> might occur in certain vulnerable individuals during treatment with atypical antipsychotics such as <START:Chemical> quetiapine <END> , <START:Chemical> clozapine <END> , or <START:Chemical> amisulpride <END> .
<START:Chemical> Dextran <END> - <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> conjugates : synthesis , in vitro and in vivo evaluation .
<START:Chemical> Etodolac <END> ( <START:Chemical> E <END> ) , is a non - narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug .
A biodegradable polymer <START:Chemical> dextran <END> has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> - <START:Chemical> dextran <END> conjugates ( ED ) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects .
An activated moiety , i . e . <START:Chemical> N - acylimidazole <END> derivative of <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> ( <START:Chemical> EAI <END> ) , was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer <START:Chemical> dextran <END> of different molecular weights ( 40000 , 60000 , 110000 and 200000 ) .
IR spectral data confirmed formation of ester bonding in the conjugates .
<START:Chemical> Etodolac <END> contents were evaluated by UV - spectrophotometric analysis .
The molecular weights were determined by measuring viscosity using the Mark - Howink - Sakurada equation .
In vitro hydrolysis of ED was done in aqueous buffers ( pH 1 . 2 , 7 . 4 , 9 ) and in 80 % ( v / v ) human plasma ( pH 7 . 4 ) .
At pH 9 , a higher rate of <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7 . 4 and 80 % human plasma ( pH 7 . 4 ) , following first - order kinetics .
In vivo investigations were performed in animals .
Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using <START:Chemical> acetic acid <END> induced <START:Disease> writhing <END> model ( mice ) and <START:Chemical> carrageenan <END> - induced rat paw <START:Disease> edema <END> model , respectively .
In comparison to control , <START:Chemical> E <END> and ED 1 - ED 4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Biological evaluation suggested that conjugates ( ED 1 - ED 4 ) retained comparable analgesic and antiinflammatory activities with remarkably reduced ulcerogenicity as compared to their parent drug -- <START:Chemical> etodolac <END> .
